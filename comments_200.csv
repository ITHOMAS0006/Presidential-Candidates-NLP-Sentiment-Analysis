5EBGhSqj8k0,left wing loonies abc summed up this historic Red Wave Landslide by refusing to call a garbage truck a garbage truck on live tv but love to call a dude a chick
5EBGhSqj8k0,"3:28 ""How do you like my garbage truck?"" he asked it in such a way like any kid would ask if one had it 😂😂😂😂 And no reporter reacted to this ..."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Anarchy 2024 and beyond
5EBGhSqj8k0,This is what won him the election.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Why don’t you also add that his administration didn’t hold funding or supplies to Puerto Rico? Because it was the corrupt PR government that did that trying to make him look bad. And that’s been proven, but ABC refuses to tell the truth and this is why legacy media is over."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Funny & Important Moment
5EBGhSqj8k0,"""How do you like my garbage Truck?"" So much meme potential here lmao"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is a fucking legend hahaha
5EBGhSqj8k0,God bless you Trump. You are the most resilient Patriot this country has ever seen.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Master troll, trolling his supporters… The joke is on you, fools. This troll is nothing but a power hungry self obsessed desperate little man trying to escape life behind bars. How can you not see something so blatantly obvious? It’s flabbergasting."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"He withheld funding because all the help he sent went straight into the pockets of the corrupt politicians and the massive amount of bottled water arrived but they failed to distribute it.  Shame on the corrupt politicians not on Trump.  Remember, in a court of law one pledges to tell the whole truth.  Press are under the same obligation albeit not the same consequences."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Well it’s great to see ABC listen to the commenters for once 😅

5EBGhSqj8k0,"4:28 if this doesn’t open your eyes to the news media being extremely left-sided against Trump then I don’t know what else to tell you. She goes on for about a minute and a half listing everything bad that Trump has ever done. OK what about anything good Trump has ever done? No one ever talks about how he makes it easier for black convicts to be in incarcerated a second time without being beaten to death. They don’t talk about the that have opened up for the black community. They don’t talk about the way Trump cleaned up our border and putting in new facilities and keeping children and women from being raped by our own people. But instead, they choose to spend 100% of their time making him look like a goddamn criminal."
5EBGhSqj8k0,🌹

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Really trying to push that ""I'm just an average Joe just like you!"" narrative. Except the fact that he's a billionaire..."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Overseas voters get an 8 day extension so this doesn’t make sense for Military and their families. Our vote should count.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Yup, Trump even shows us that he should be a garbage truck driver. He is such a liar yet he brought up what the “comedian” said about Puerto Rico and he agreed with him! You trump lovers voting on a liar? Be my guest and have fun with project 2025, look it up and don’t start to weep if he wins! 🤦🏻‍♀️"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"So sad to see so much darkness in the world, but there is light and life in Jesus Christ John 14:6 ""Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me."" Receive Jesus today by faith (placing your trust in Him alone) 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 ""3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that He appeared to Cephasa and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 8 And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one of untimely birth."""

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"Wolf always looks like a deer in a headlight.   
He almost looks like he is on jeopardy again."
Q7W2ei6n6-o,"""Kudos to CNN for hosting the pivotal debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which ultimately revealed the cracks in Biden's campaign and led to his withdrawal from the presidential race. The debate, held on June 27, 2024, was a game-changer, with many considering Biden's performance as the worst in televised presidential debate history ¹. The aftermath saw widespread calls for Biden to drop out, with notable Democrats like James Carville and Andrew Yang leading the charge ¹. Biden's exit paved the way for Kamala Harris to take the reins, and we saw a shift in the dynamics of the election. Credit goes to CNN for facilitating this critical moment in the 2024 presidential election."""

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"It's Over For Harris!  

The Empty, Hocus-Pocus, Smoke and Mirrors campaign of Harris/Walz has Collapsed due to its Vague, Confusing, Gaslighting, Flip-Flopping, Misleading and Out-of-Touch political messaging to American Voters.

Harris Obviously DOES NOT have a positive agenda for the Country. She supposedly wants to fix the Major  problems in America that SHE HAD CREATED in the first place. Figure that one out Leftists!!!

We the Millions upon Millions upon Millions of Intelligent American Citizens across the Country and throughout the World can Clearly See right through the Fakeness of the Most Radical Communist/Socialist/Marxist Liberal Democrat politician ever to seek the Presidency. She WILL BE Rejected by the People today.

Right now as we speak, President Trump is ahead in the Honest Polls as he continues on a Trajectory toward his Massive Landslide Blowout Re-election Victory to the Tremendous Joy, Delight, Happiness and Major Relief of the America Public.  😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊"

Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire all have the voting polls closed at 8 PM ET but
CNN didn’t show the result, but keep going west to Kansas, Arizona, the Dakotas, Wyoming etc, 
Mr. King is it your plan to make is all Republican wins,  so you can showcase the comeback of Democrats?

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump is a criminal and a liar!😊
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"As a libertarian I was genuinely interested in seeing your point of view and I guess I still am somewhat but once I heard you talk about trump being a monarch , you really lost me , if you think he’s going to be a monarch that tells me your not an objective observer"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Incels love trump and they are for sure have a big role in making him win not only the boomers , incels in general find in dictators a good chance to help them control women by giving them the power through laws to do that so they support dictators to gain that power ; its a beneficial exchange relationship between incels and dictators
Incels are dictators but over women so they like dictators in power because they are like them with very similar goal to control other people and make their lives miserable ! Incels are very dangerous because they want to aid tyrants to be in authority so that they will have power over women as  dictators have power over people !"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,P25 is fake
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Tripe
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I don’t think the creators of this channel realize most of America does want the illegals deported and this crazy “woke” gender ideology to end..
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Shut the fuck up. You had your turn and you fucked up massively for everyone. It's time for a change.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Dude just unintentionally advertised coors on his anti capitalist channel. Sick
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"arm yourselves.  ,protests will surely happen and maga idiots who don't undertsand wont show up but acrual christio=fascists militias who undertand there can be no dissent will and there will be noj accountability for them"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Is this video also powered by Coors?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The question is: How do we stop them?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This is well produced propaganda. You tell just by the thumbnail. Unsubscribing.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"It seems pretty clear that for us Europeans, America will soon no longer be regarded as a friend or ally. 

I saw in the report it mentioned '....to deploy a Neutron bomb in Europe' - so is America planning to detonate s nuclear bomb over Europe at some point in the near future??! 

First of all - Why????  ...but also, this Project 2025 is so nuts as to be both farcical and extremely scary. It's basically a 'manifesto for madness' - and a clear indication that Trump wants to turn America into a military dictatorship. 

So much for freedoms Americans. It looks very much like its goodbye to democracy in the US as we know it."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I'm sorry but the closing statement is bullshit. 
""there wont be a big civil war"", don't downplay, I thought you were being realistic till the end there, lol"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"We know! The Heritage Foundation.  Would've been nice to know long before now considering this coup has been in the works for decades!
All you failed! Years late and the wealth gap continues to grow and we wait till the train crashes before we react!

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The Heritage Foundation, yeah, the Nazi heritage."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Proud trump voter here.  Dont believe trump is implimenting project 2025.  He might take advice but hes not gna follow something herritage foundation wrote to a t.  Thats rediculous.  No president would just say .  Heck write up ur plans and ill just do as you say.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I don't need to see more of the Project 2025 content to draw comparison to the one in the highly controversial Protocol of The Elders of Zion. Matters little who was or still is behind such a despicable line of thought, very dangerous for any democratic society seeking harmony, justice and decency for all!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Anyone interested in learning more about the kind of people involved in and working on Heritage Foundation type projects to the detriment of the general population should also be taking a look at a relatively new think tank, the America First Policy Institute. It was established by a major Trump supporter in 2021 just after Trump lost to Biden. Many people with the AFPI also hold significant roles in the Trump transition team and advising Trump on policy."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump pretending he’s not familiar with 2025 foundation is such BS. He’s lied so much we can tell from the tone in his voice when he’s lying!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Bro those curly q's are disgusting
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Lmao is this channel real or is this the matrix
8eeCPRD0Hgg,It's really embarrassing as an American to see how many people loyally support Trump And have 0 knowledge of project 2025 or basic knowledge of our government and civics.. They literally seen a famous person from the apprentice say what they want they're putting our country in his hands.. Such a sad embarrassing time for our country
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I have been e big fan of your channel, but your political belifs and stuff are really ruining you channel. Obviously you posted this right after Trump was elected and the president-elect has disregarded it a long time ago. Why are u still talking about it?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This corporate and anti union takeover is happening all around the western world. The sixties and seventies were the best for the working guy.  It has been steadily getting worse and you can see it on the streets. People are suffering out there while the big guys get wealthier .  We need a revolution ...
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The Heritage Foundation is actually “The Deep State” Trump keeps projecting on the Democrats.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"""I believe the country should be ran by billionaires and (fake)Christians!""

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Re-watching this from overseas, post-election. If only Americans had pushed back when Kamala was slotted in - rather than standing for primary nomination, the second trump presidency might have been averted. In fact, if you lot had pushed back at Joe stepping back from the election, yet still remaining in power for the rest of his term, you would have shown the establishment you have at least some political awareness. You've now doomed yourself to corporatocracy rule, and the rest of the world will suffer their warmongering, thieving ways. Thanks a lot."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The shady group behind Project 2025 and Agenda 2030 is United Nations 🇺🇳
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The other night Steve Barron said on his podcast:  ""Project 2025 is our Agenda""  (Donvict knew)
Good Luck America."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,mmmmmmmmmmbbbbbbbbb

8eeCPRD0Hgg,The US is being run by corporations regardless of which party is in power.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Innocent names with evil 😈 agendas wow 😮
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump just announce plans to drain the swamp! Finally getting corruption out the system!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Why is this not illegal?

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Twisted Christians made the USA a commercialized judicially corrupt illegitimate country. We are experiencing the fall of the United States of America.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"A little bit late or not; being dutch I already checked this manifest, called Project 2025, out. Mme Harris warned about it. How come the Americans did not?? because of your media, focussing on trump cursing and insulting; this was a diversionay maneuver..."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Thanks!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"God, I remember this so clearly."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Is there a happy ending to this story? Probably not.🤨
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Well its now reality, we effed around and we are about to find out!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I think the whole world must implement a rule that political leaders must always be attached to a lie detector when they debate, rally, give speeches and negotiate."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Project 2025 is fucking awesome, did anyone here actually read it?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"At least America, your president is an overt liar. 😏"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump “I wish them well.”
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Yeah sure you don’t know.  Even China is partners with you on this.  Damn shame you are still lying to your people.  Shame
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Well…
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Very scary stuff. The UK is worryingly going in a similar path. Luckily our PM doesn't have the same amount of power a President does and whilst I am no fan of the royal family at least they provide a safety net.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Wonderfully presented piece. I really enjoyed it. Nevertheless, as an educated, critical thinker, i’m compelled to check sources ITMT. Corporate capitalism, human selfishness, greed, hyper-consumerism, laziness, ignorance, American exceptionalism, and bad old bigotry are destroying our ability to survive on this planet. That’s the elephant in the room that neither parties’ platform continues to fail to address. climate change and biosphere compromise. Ultimately, my determination is that we’re a petty, short-sighted species. Nowhere near enlightened as we’ve lead ourselves to believe."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"To get a basic glimpse of what to do, you definitely must read ""The Fascist Offensive and the Tasks of the Communist International in the Struggle of the Working Class against Fascism""  (by Dimitrov). 

It's short enough to finish in 2 or 3 hours."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Please make another video soon. We need hope after this election. No one knows what is to do and so many people are horrified for the future. I’m sure you know now is our last chance to act and is the perfect time. We can’t allow things to go back to normal and let our world burn. We have less than 5 years before the point of no return.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Frankly, I honestly doubt Trump will ever actually be allowed to enact *half* the shit he's been rambling about on stage, even WITH the majority of power concentrated in Republican hands.

Like, the moment his primary voter base of American nationalists realize why Trump is the only candidate running in 2028, they will eat him alive.

Say what you will about Trump supporters, and I'd probably agree, but the one thing they can all be of one mind on is the fact that the American Dream includes fighting against tyranny from without and/or within. Preferably with extremely violent prejudice.

Especially if he so much as *touches* the Constitution and the Bill of Rights."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Russell Vought?
What an appropriate name."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Well, I guess we'll see if he has anything to do with them."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I wish we had an another Bush in the government!! Trump is a wannabe ""conservativist"""
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The US left and intelligentsia are the better educated Nazis. The only difference to the far right.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"As a non-American, I don't understand what the heck the Americans are thinking, whether it's Trump or Harris, you aren't winning, period. The ones winning are the rich, corporations and Israel no matter who is president. The middle class will continue to vanish and things are not going to get better. Once the downward spiral starts, there is no stopping it. Karma is right around the corner :)"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Thank you
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Did you mention Francis Schaeffer Christian writer and theologian in the 70s and 80s? No, why not. You’re younger than me Francis Schaeffer wrote a manifesto for essentially the violent take over by the church of the country if they couldn’t influence the nation to become essentially who Roman Catholic medieval Europe was. Find Frank Schaeffer his son who is no longer part of that world, but he was there and he knows the world of right wing Christianity of the seventies and 80s."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Keep fighting the good fight and stay safe!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Look no further than the federalist society.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,So this is how liberty dies...with thunderous applause
8eeCPRD0Hgg,the worst thing is the people part of it are now going to be in office and saying they will do it.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,We need you
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This video is terrifying considering we are 2 days post election. Hang on tight everyone.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Bad time to turn into a femboy 😢
8eeCPRD0Hgg,It’s so over for us
8eeCPRD0Hgg,yall really think the dems aren't backed by similar people? Just look at the people the Clintons etc. had ties with. I don't say that Trump is better but yall really think only the Republicans are playing that game? Kamala sais she wants to save abortion. Oh really? Tell me how she gon overrule a Supreme Court Decision (that abortion is a state affair )without fundamentaly changing the Constitution of America? Trump also used very questionable means to achieve this win. But why were immigrants allowed to vote eventough they just arrived? They don't know about the struggles of the country when they just arrived there tf? the two party system is f---ed. the only way to save you american people is to overthrow the two party system by starting to vote third parties like the rest of the democratic world. Your not stupid because you votedfor trump or kamala. your stupid because yall getting fooled by the same two machineries every 4 years. and then yall critizise people for voting jill stein tf if you really hate trump that much why dont You young people start to change the system within the boundries of the next election. Just like in Europe with some parties in the past years....
8eeCPRD0Hgg,hahahahahahahaha kamaLa
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"""Anti capitalist""= i hate my life because im not qualified to make more money 😂

Idk what fantasy economic system you all have in your head but truth is some people deserve more than others. All men are created equal but we dont stay equal. Capatilism is what leads people to be great and the people who hate it are just upset they got left behind"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Just remember the same people who are saying Trump will ruin the country are the same ones who said Kamala was winning by a landslide. These people are never right so lets pray they dont start saying Trump will be a great president 😂
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Doesn't want to talk about it- meanwhile he's taking every chance to distance himself from it...
8eeCPRD0Hgg,o oh
8eeCPRD0Hgg,A Second Thought: One of the truly last bastions of sanity and reason.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,the irony that this 'channel' relies on a platform built on perpetuating the very systems it decries always pulls me out of the narrative somewhat. good points at times but still 6/10. a little too dystopian for me when i see the 'algorithm' show me this channel as something i would like (and therefore something youtube/alphabet can get money from my attention for). i miss old pbs.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"People think trump supporters/lovers are dumb while in reality they are sociopaths, fascists ,and authoritarians lovers and probably they are laughing because they made everyine think they are naive and gullible while they are far from it !"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Does anyone know which video or his mentions heavy surveillance?? Specifically palandir and some other companies lol
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Dude, what do you think you were doing here?? You keep complaining about the Democrats being the ""lesser evil"", but when it comes to the presidential elections, you suddenly start telling us how dangerous the Republicans are?
You are part of the reason why the Democrats lost 15 million votes compared to 2020 and why Donald Trump will be the next - and maybe last - president of the United States. Thanks for nothing."

I dedicated Years and Thousands of hours of my own time doing research and Deep Research on these (i.e. Koch Brothers) Authoritarian Parasitic Capitalist Fascist POS Few Evil MF'ers.

""Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are, in principle, under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist, that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level. [...] Just as I'm opposed to political fascism, I am opposed to economic fascism. I think that until the major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities, it's pointless to talk about democracy."" - Noam Chomsky 

""Capitalism’s concept of competitive man who seeks only to maximize wealth and power, who subjects himself to market relationships, to exploitation and external authority, is anti-human and intolerable in the deepest sense"" - Noam Chomsky 

“Man and fascism cannot co-exist. If fascism conquers, man will cease to exist and there will remain only man-like creatures that have undergone an internal transformation. But if man, man who is endowed with reason and kindness, should conquer, then Fascism must perish, and those who have submitted to it will once again become people.” ― Vasily Grossman (Life and Fate) 

“You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her whole soul.” - Mahatma Gandhi 

""Historically, the most terrible things - war, genocide, and slavery - have resulted not from disobedience, but from obedience."" - Howard Zinn

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"great job. Hope you are happy with the election results. You and other gen Z wannabe intellectuals made fascism possible in america again.

I warned you a year ago this would happen.

I genuinely hope you are happy."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,He won. Cry about it
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"As a bisexual female American, Project 2025 is a threat to my rights and others like me. Unfortunately, I am now watching America fall apart. My English 3 teacher wants us to not argue, but discuss and share our opinions and ideas. Who asked for this? I'm scared now, as someone who *DREAMS* of being a U.S. Senator."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Heritage foundation ain’t sounding like a think tank anymore.. they sound like a hard core lobby group.

Its the ownersof factories, and champaign drinking posho filth"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"How do you feel about leftists saying they're ""sitting this one out"", or voting 3rd party? Are you terrified that a loss for the Democrats this time around will push them further right, again? I want to hope for what we can do in the future, but I've always said you shouldn't criticize the government if you didn't vote to change it."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,whoa whoa whoa.... I like Trump but the party who thinks all of that is gonna happen is crazy. What do they think Trump would make it illegal to be Gay or Trans?? Every other percent of people will step up on taking such freedom of love and being away. Yes the Dems. are weaponizing them and making a mocker of them but do you think that the fault of anyone one of us? To have them wanting pawns to use as numbers? I think Trump will fix some problems and stop some unneeded wars cause by sleepy joe maybe we can afford food and gas and rent and everything little goddam thing that has gone up. That's why I'm voting Trump and I'm Pansexual and practice Pagan belief I hope that pisses off anyone who has a problem with that. ^^
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I do love this but one part he didn't cover.  Why is the heritage foundation so obsessed in being bigoted towards the marginalized?  Wouldn't companies profit off of being more diverse in their jobs and make them more money which is what conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation always seem to focus on.  Why this?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"YouTube keeps deleting my comment🤔 I love this video🫶
When is the left version of project scary 2025❓

I know I have to find leftists in my community then figure out how to plan actions that respects their extremely limited time due to daily work, home, and family responsibilities. 

I want to learn how to enable the isolated leftists in my rural community without making us a target of all the violent right wingers in my area.

I'm really hoping for a training series about how to organize local leftist coalitions to help united regular people against corporate billionaires stealing from the working-class people of our communities with their invisible hand tactics."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Are you implying the Heritage Fund does *not* influence the Democrats too?   Surely they do.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Why are we just now hearing about this?
Who are the third party financial institutions?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Tax all churches NOW tax them higher than a legitimate business which provides legitimate products and services. Religion will die without their huge tax free profits and parsonages being exempt from taxation. Without religion, we will be free to think for ourselves."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Frightening how the Heritage Foundation can influence Presidents, government and the US to this extent.."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,They have been working to dumb down the country through things like No Child Left Behind so the populace won’t want to attempt even starting to read Project 2025.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,This guy is full of it. pretty scummy.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Mean TV sounds strangely like a little mini capitalism. Hopefully it doesn’t get overrun with psychopaths like American capitalism.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,What do we do to fully stop them though. This is informative but what’s the solution??
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"😕🤔 this project 2025 , heritage foundation and christian  nationalism is NoT about the Christian Faith ; it's about power and elitist white men's politics and civil and religious control over resources and people's lives , from so called christians who have also gone so far off the track from fundamental Christianity , that calling it religious zealotry and religious confusion and religious fanaticism and religious extremism is far too lenient terminology ; as it will ultimately lead to many forms of civil and religious intolerence and persecutions ; this is The Stuff of Dark Ages BADness , working in real time full disclosure and revelation ,  and could very quickly become far more worse than it was back then❗‼️😳

⚠️⚠️  Trump Presidency WILL TRIGGER INSTITUTIONALIZED CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM ❗‼️
   ..WHICH IS NOT BIBLICAL ‼️⚠️ ; IT IS MAN MADE TRADITIONS OF THE MOST FANATICAL RELIGIOUS ZEALOTRY , IN THE MOST DARK AGES EUROPEAN SENSE OF ""POPE AND KING"" AKA A CRUEL ""UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF CHURCH AND STATE"" ; DIRECETED AT CONTROLLING THE MINDS AND CONSCIENCES OF THE PEOPLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN FREE WILL DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR PERSONS , THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR ACTS OF WORSHIP UNDER GOD❗‼️🤨
    ..READ THE USA CONSTITUTION AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT 🇺🇸  ..AND KNOW FOR SURE WHERE OUR PILGRIM FORE-FATHERS HAD COME FROM IN THEIR THINKING , FAR AWAY FROM RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE AND PERSECUTIONS‼️

✅ True , Christian Nationalism is a SNARE upon the USA and it's Constitution ; and will become a geo- religio-political Snare upon the world❗only to offer draconian firman decretals upon All people‼️🤔

   All of This was Prophesied , and will come to pass upon the USA and upon the world stage , If it is allowed to , by the People ‼️🤨

modern day passages from a true modern day Prophet of God....
Ellen Gould White, 1917, Prophets and Kings, 277. ChS 52.1 - ChS 52.3

I highly recommend reading ""THE GREAT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN""
ELLEN G.WHITE  1888  REV. 1911
[modern day authentic seer/prophet of God]

Chapter 36 - The Impending Conflict
""Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and under the influence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience."" GC 588.1

As the Protestant churches reject the clear, Scriptural arguments in defense of God’s law, they will long to silence those whose faith they cannot overthrow by the Bible. Though they blind their own eyes to the fact, they are now adopting a course which will lead to the persecution of those who conscientiously refuse to do what the rest of the Christian world are doing, and acknowledge the claims of the papal sabbath. GC 592.2

The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, persuade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of divine authority will be supplied by oppressive enactments. Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for truth; and even in free America, rulers and legislators, in order to secure public favor, will yield to the popular demand for a law enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which has cost so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected. In the soon-coming conflict we shall see exemplified the prophet’s words: “The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” Revelation 12:17. GC 592.3"

OFi73TzEN_8,No one gets anything done. America is a construction site with the crew on lunch
OFi73TzEN_8,"So you know what my plan is the next 4 years, I'm gonna sit on my ass all year playing video games, and just like a farmer who got his stipends and tax cuts Im not gonna produce a lick of anything, because I know. im the level headed person who ""cared"" about the rules, and when people like me stop caring because we have a president that doesnt care for rules. Your so fucked. Lets put it this way, it doesnt matter what I do, Im usually a leader because of my work ethic. Im the type of person you thank, because I saved you from almost dying. Without me, next time. Try not to die."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats got alot done, youre just not paying attention, I actually pay attention and realize fuck it Im the only level headed person here, so when I start cheating the system and doing just like a republican youre really fucked, cause nothing actually gets done without me.

Youre a bunch of fatasses who'd like to think you do something, but your highly toxic and carry the sin of pride in the face of your neighbors. You call democrats your enemies but when called upon in war you expect them to be your brothers in arms against korea china or russia? Good luck it seems like your sealing your fate more and more choosing to retalliate against eachother and decide its okay for some one like trump to represent you. Its not okay. Nothing is okay.

When we go to war, I am my mothers only son, and therefore am allowed to choose to not go to war in any war draft, so either way I wouldn't be fighting with you, but if I wasn't I would fight against the United State Draft myself as I see my leaders do not represent my values, and I do not wish to fight for their values or lives. 

Try fighting them on your own. Youre gonna regret this all someday."
OFi73TzEN_8,Keep giving farmers tax cuts so they can buy big trucks and sit on their ass year round and never produce a lick of anything.

OFi73TzEN_8,I honestly don't care about Politics as long they stay out of Scientific literature reviews from Research industries that have committees of Ethics published experts that have deeper knowledge about their field of studies this is where I stand apolitical only loyal to scientific community.
OFi73TzEN_8,Only way to solve the root cause of this is Americal People movement asking for the Change of the election system 🎉
OFi73TzEN_8,"That's an easy question... it's because they don't care! On the few occasions when they're not trying to be a poor imitation of the GOP from 30 yrs ago, they're held up by either not having the majority or having it & tryin to play nice with Republicans despite Republicans never returning favor. Guess it's easier to lie to voters at election time than it is to keep promises by actually doing the work necessary. As a registered Democrat, the Democratic party is DEAD to me! They've broken every single promise & just ran out of excuses! 
Nancy & Chuck y'all the establishment & part of the problem! Until we get rid of the Nancy's & Chuck's, I'm DONE with Democrats! Y'all can't even agree on how to make ice water & since you're too stupid to listen to voters (like how the system's designed), get bent & don't come back!"

OFi73TzEN_8,"As long as the US continues to give its citizenry a relatively comfortable life, feeds the consumption addiction and keeps the dollar strong, this won't change. As long as people can live comfortably, they'll (whether consciously or not) turn a blind eye to all this.

Should any one of those dominoes tip over, the rest falls, and living standards plummet, THAT'S when you'll start seeing the pushback. If that's not managed, that's when you'll see the protests and the rioting. 

And THAT is why as a non-American I'm 100% excited to have BRICS succeed. Let's see how this continues if and when the dollar loses relevance."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Democrats basically let Trump win. All their inaction was to get people mad enough to vote for Trump, a 3rd party, or not vote at all. And it worked.

The Democrats are the Republicans' useful idiots."
OFi73TzEN_8,Who’s here doomwatching after the election 😔
OFi73TzEN_8,They do. They try to have equal opportunity for those of color. The Biden Harris Administration produced more jobs for black people on record. And that's a no no.

OFi73TzEN_8,Damnedcrats.
OFi73TzEN_8,"It’s odd how this video doesn’t at all mention the “No Corporate PAC Pledge”, that most Democrats take. And the politicians that advocate for overturning the Citizens United ruling, that allows for Corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on PACs, is largely a Democratic voice. I’m not saying this video doesn’t have a point to make for criticizing Dems for shooting themselves in the foot, but without providing a complete picture it just sounds like disingenuous Socialist Propaganda. Capitalism and Socialism both have horrible outcomes if they are taken to the extreme without the proper protections in place. I’m registered Republican btw."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Love your vids! Although ""organized masses"" sounds great and all, the TRUE power of our species is ""waking the fuck up."" Your leftist ideology is cool and all, but that won't clear a path toward freedom. It only clears a path toward another lie: governance is necessary. It isn't."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Not sure if this has been mentioned, but Helldivers 2 (video game), uses ""managed democracy"" as a tagline for the governance of the future. Citizens fill out questionnaires and according to their response, their vote goes toward the most aligned candidate. TOTALLY not fascist rhetoric. Trust the State. Big Brother loves you."
OFi73TzEN_8,The thumbnail is missing a picture of Obama and the Clintons
OFi73TzEN_8,The only politician that backed most of his promises is Donald Trump
OFi73TzEN_8,President Donald Trump approved
OFi73TzEN_8,"Small flaw in the anti-Democrat logic represented here. 

The failure of the Democrats to pass some key legislation like single payer, the public option or student loan forgiveness went down due to the razor thin majority they had at the time. Two or three Senators. Or a handful of House Reps. So, the obvious answer to counter everything described in this video is literally 10 to 15 more Democrats in seats in both chambers. With a super majority+ like that, no amount of Democratic party funding of conservative Democrat candidates will matter. The voters, choosing to elect progressive Democrats is what matters.

That is a much more reasonable, rational and frankly achievable option than trying to build an entirely new 3rd party to do what you already are 10 seats or so away from having with the Democrat party.

The flaw in the logic of this video is the idea that Democrats had the control or ability to ensure their majority was as thin as it was, on purpose. That they didn't fight for every seat they could to gain power. The alternative and let's be honest, more likely explanation to why Dems pour so much money into conservative Dem candidates is that their races are typically competitive, and a conservative Democrat seated is better than a Republican in the seat caucusing with the GOP and giving them the speaker and Majority leader powers."
OFi73TzEN_8,"As a registered Democratic voter myself, I found it disappointing when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer met with President Trump over his proposed tax cuts. This would've been a golden opportunity to tell the president we want an increase in the minimum wage in return for those tax cuts. SQUANDERED OPPORTUNITY... WTF 🤬🤬🤬,?!!!"

OFi73TzEN_8,"I can tell you exactly why nothing gets done by criminal democrats. Every time I open my IPad, it show Biden in Africa begging to be in control of African minerals.  Biden is trying to trick the Leadership of the nation to allow him to put the U S military on their land.  
Biden is also offering to loan money and to overcharge for loans.  African do not need the U S loans, they have their own wealth. 
Africa does not want to be a part of Biden plan to steal Africa mineral, like that big genocide Biden got going on in Palatine and he is 
Stupid enough to think Israel should have those people country.   How stupid can a so called president of the U S be?  Africa does not want anything to do with you and your racism.  Please stick with your racist groups.  Most  people of the world do not want, to be a part of the Zionist racism."

What Joe Biden has done:

Year One (all credit to u/backpackwayne)

Highlights from Year One

•	⁠Reversed Trump's Muslim ban •	⁠Historic Stimulus Bill passed •	⁠Ended the war in Afghanistan (Set in place by Trump*) •	⁠Reduction of poverty levels by 45% along with reduction of child poverty levels by 61% by the first 6 months •	⁠5 Rounds of cancellation of student loan debt totaling almost $10 billion •	⁠Passed largest infrastructure bill in history •	⁠The unemployment rate dropped from 6.2% when Biden took office to 3.9%, the biggest single year drop in American history. (This was also affected by COVID quarantine ending.)

Year Two

Highlights from Year Two

•	⁠The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 •	⁠3 Additional rounds of student loan debt cancellation (8 rounds so far), totaling up $35 billion for 20-40 million Americans •	⁠First major gun legislation in 30 years •	⁠CHIPS Act to protect American supply of semi-conductor chips •	⁠$62 billion worth of health care subsidies under the ACA (Obamacare), capping insulin at $35 •	⁠Allows Medicare to negotiate 100 drugs over the next decade, and requires drug companies to rebate price increases higher than inflation •	⁠Unemployment at 50 year low

Year Three

Highlights from Year Three

•	⁠Got republicans to publicly take Social Security and Medicare cuts off the table by tricking them during the State of the Union •	⁠6 More rounds of student loan debt cancellation (14 rounds so far), totaling up to $127 billion •	⁠As of October 2023, 34 straight months of job growth, longest stretch of unemployment below 4% since the 1960s •	⁠Child poverty rates fall from 12.6% to 5.8% due to Biden's Expanded Child Tax Credits, 2.9 million kids escape poverty •	⁠World's best post-pandemic recovery, doubles all nations except Japan •	⁠Created 14 million jobs since he took office - More than any president in history did in four years (and its only been 3 years) •	⁠Black unemployment rate lower under Biden than any other administration (4.7%) - Compared to black unemployment under Trump was 2nd worst number in history, reaching over 16% •	⁠Diversity in justice: Majority of Biden’s appointed judges are women, racial or ethnic minorities – a first for any president •	⁠Rail companies grant paid sick days after administration pressure in win for unions.  Most people will only remember that he forced rail workers to go back to work in December 2022, even now that will be the top answer if you google ""Biden Railworker Deal"".  But most people do not know that the Biden administration continued to pressure the rail corporations and work with the unions so that in June 2023, the corporations capitulated and gave the rail workers what they wanted.  Biden knows how to work politics and knows that the real work isn't done with the cameras on you for a soundbite, but in the background where people can debate without a fickle public watching every move.

Year Four (so far)

Highlights from Year Four

• Another round of student loan cancellation, $1.2 billion this time, 15 rounds so far, totaling more than $128 billion •	Growth shatters expectations: GDP expands 3.1% - a year beginning with heavy odds of a recession •	⁠Post-pandemic recover still leading the world by far •	⁠Plan to modernize American ports •	⁠Rescinds Trump-era ""Denial of Care"" rule that allowed health care workers to deny medical care to patients because of their personal religious or moral belief •	⁠Violent crime drop significantly since 2020 •	⁠$5.8 billion to clean up nation’s drinking water and upgrade infrastructure."

OFi73TzEN_8,"True for both Democrats and Republicans. Only difference is what they stand for, people and corporations. As the US is capitalist, government will never work hard for the people that make the 1% extremely rich, make the 1% keep investing, and keep the economy growing. It's not that difficult ... 

A more socialist government would benefit the citizens of the US. But that would mean more taxes, also from the richest people, a better distribution of wealth, and more. Americans don't want to share and let everyone have a piece of the pie. For Americans it's ME only. Too bad."
OFi73TzEN_8,hey it might be a good idea to give more power to the president and less on the house and the senate. and they can still have lobbying power if a republican becomes president again
OFi73TzEN_8,We need a constitutional republic party fr
OFi73TzEN_8,"Didnt the democrats pass these laws i heard about? Inflation Reduction Act: Signed into law, this bill includes $369 billion in clean energy investments, provisions to lower prescription drug costs, and increased taxes on large corporations.
Butch Lewis Act: Enacted into law, this legislation provides significant improvements to union retirement security, marking the most substantial law in over 50 years.
PACT Act: Signed into law, this bipartisan bill expands benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans and their survivors, the most significant expansion in over 30 years.
Infrastructure Bill: Signed into law, this $1 trillion bill addresses infrastructure needs, including road and bridge repairs, high-speed internet for rural communities, and more.
Gun Safety Bill: Signed into law, this legislation is the largest gun-safety bill to pass Congress in nearly 30 years, responding to mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York."

OFi73TzEN_8,"btw, thank you for keeping the background music very quiet. it makes it possible for me to listen to your video as if it was a podcast; so many youtube videos are ruined for me because the background music is too distracting and takes up too much energy for me to try to tune out."

OFi73TzEN_8,"I'm sorry but this is bullshit.  Democrats got A LOT done!  The infrastructure bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan for starters, despite having the smallest possible majority in the Senate and usually with zero help from Republicans.  They got within two votes of passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and they will if they're given control of both the House and the Senate (now that Manchin and Synema will be gone).  Even more important, Democrats believe in democracy, the rule of law, the peaceful transfer of power, and people's fundamental rights and freedoms (like abortion, contraception, etc.) while the GOP is a fascist cult.  Are they perfect?  No, but no one and nothing is.  I'd be way more open to this channel's viewpoints and arguments if it actually cared about facts and didn't spew the usual far left ""both sides are the same"" false equivalency bullshit."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Idk, the ACA comes to mind immediately, same with infrastructure bill"
OFi73TzEN_8,"just finished watching 2024 debate. i was already decided, but am not a diehard supporter of either one (just have to be diehard *against* one of them) and i do not think the debate gave any confidence to any currently undecided voters, and i dont think media coverage understands what undecided voters care about. for example i find it really hard to believe that average undecided voters care about the recent ""eating dogs"" issue, or about harris ""getting on trump's nerves"", but those were the major things the media talked about immediately after the debate. trump was allowed to go on the entire debate about inflation, grocery prices and crime, and regardless of whether there are lies or oversimplifications about those issues, they are the issues that surely resonate with undecided voters who dont pay much attention to politics and simply care about being able to live their lives. trump constantly criticized harris for being in the same party that has not created enough tangible life improvements for working class americans despite always using beautiful language ""hopes, dreams, vision"" claiming that they will make improvements. people seriously struggle to pay for things they used to be able to pay for, and are genuinely worried about crime. people havent felt many tangible life improvements under democratic leadership, which gives republicans the ability to criticize democrats (obama, biden, harris) for not doing anything in their terms in office. i know its the main reason leftists criticize democrats because it's true, they are unable to act.

sorry my thoughts are a mess and i'm not able to articulate clearly. i just completely disagree that democrat fans call it a sweeping victory debate for harris - it seems like they have no hope of gaining support of working class people that dont pay much attention to politics. if you disagree with me or spot logical fallacy then there may be something i dont understand and i'd be happy to discuss. if you make an unnecessarily aggressive reply then you are part of the problem. nobody has the same two life experiences."

Enforced neutrality on the media, no ad hominem rhetoric strictly the policy proposal, let the ideas stand up to scrutiny.  Balanced budget amendment.  Massive automation for the bureocracy, limits on how long one can be a federal employee.  No special health care for house and senate.  Spread the federal government across the country, no central locus of power.  Not sure how my ideas are partisan, seems like a way to combat corruption, and focus on policy alone."

OFi73TzEN_8,PLEASE fix the intro bell. It really hurts my ears and my dog woke up. Just a slightly lower tone around 0:17 thanks
OFi73TzEN_8,"You people think you should get anything you want, without any checks or balances."
OFi73TzEN_8,"They get done exactly what they want to get done.    Stupid people continue to vote for teem, so why should they actually do anything? ask those steady Balck voters.  its simple, vote accordingly."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Some good points on this video, I do agree that we have a serious lack of choice within politics but socialists never seem to be explain how a socialist government would be better able to better deal with corruption and nepotism"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Argument: The Inevitable Alliance Between Dolphins, Extraterrestrials, and the Proletariat

Posadism teaches us that the coming revolution is not confined to humanity alone—it is a cosmic, interspecies struggle against capitalist exploitation. The dolphins, as the most intelligent non-human species on Earth, have long been suppressed by the imperialist forces of humanity. They possess a sophisticated communication network, which, according to Posadist theory, allows them to communicate with extraterrestrial beings.

These extraterrestrials, having observed the plight of the dolphins, have secretly allied with them. Together, they plan to guide the proletariat toward the final revolution. Dolphins, with their unparalleled understanding of the ocean and the ability to coordinate with aliens, will lead the charge by disrupting global capitalist trade routes through the seas, thereby collapsing the global economy.

The aliens, in turn, will use their superior technology to disable the bourgeoisie’s control over information, breaking the chains of mass media manipulation. They will reveal the truth of the capitalist exploitation not only to humans but to all sentient beings on Earth, uniting them in a global uprising. The proletariat, alongside their dolphin comrades and extraterrestrial allies, will rise to overthrow the capitalist system, establishing a new, interspecies communist order.

In this new society, humans, dolphins, and aliens will live in harmony, with resources shared equitably among all sentient beings. The oceans, free from capitalist exploitation, will be the new cradle of this revolutionary society, where dolphins will play a key role in governance, using their unique abilities to maintain balance and harmony. The revolution is inevitable, and the dolphins are ready to take their place as leaders of the new world order!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Starting in November, Americans travel to European. They must have their fingerprint recorded because of demoncrat illegal immigrants policies. 
the Brussels-led bloc is finally reforming its border policy to meet the challenges of modern times, from security threats to irregular migration, especially from America."
OFi73TzEN_8,The invisible hand of elitists controls donkey and elephant puppets on stage behind closed doors!
OFi73TzEN_8,Both sides do this. The republic dropped the Biden backed border proposal. https://youtu.be/1iSffeEPRC0?si=4tJtQj7v9oICMZ3N
OFi73TzEN_8,How much do they get paid?
OFi73TzEN_8,Because they are both Neo Liberal parties. Same with the Labour party of the UK. It's why I vote for the Greens
OFi73TzEN_8,Money.  Always about the money.
OFi73TzEN_8,Talk about never getting things done? The only presidents to ever lose jobs were republican.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Every kamala voters is the same ""in voting for kamala because I dislike trump."" That's not a valid reason to vote for someone. Trump knows how to run a country. Kamala knows how to get murders and drugs across the border. Something she was in charge of as vice president and now promises to fix when she's president??? Really a problem she started she promises to fix. If you vote with her you're just a clown. Stop voting with your feelings and vote with your brain."
OFi73TzEN_8,Fake news!
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because America has no slaves anymore, they feel no purpose anymore 😂😂😂😂😂"
OFi73TzEN_8,The last good Democrat presidents this country ever had was JFK and FDR!!
OFi73TzEN_8,Real change comes from the organized masses. ❤
OFi73TzEN_8,"Hey ST!

Can you give me the Sources from what you used in this Video?   I'm Curious to understand what is going on the Situation!



...Especially when the USA is being Fascistisation of its Bourgeois Politics."
OFi73TzEN_8,I only vote for democrats because republicans do so much anti lgbt stuff and a lot have alarming beliefs. I don't vote for democrats I vote against republicans
OFi73TzEN_8,"Never gets anything done. 
Bro 50 million jobs were created under democratic presidents. Maybe you haven’t noticed but the world is more progressive now then 30 years ago. 
Stop it with this doom thinking, you make us look bad"
OFi73TzEN_8,"So, what do we do about this? How do we ever break away from this corrupt system?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Our administration spent more time undoing the last administration’s work and focused allot of money and energy on Jan 6th and prosecuting trump. Then allot of effort to forgive debts that they weren’t owed and were legal agreements under the laws the federal government made that they are supposed to maintain and enforce. With their main concerns being abortion being a constitutional right and calling it womens healthcare and taxpayers funding it as the frontline of contraception because it’s the most expensive and money involved while accommodating up to thirty million illegal immigrants on domestic soils while not fixing our homeless problems that were about less than 650,000 nationally and hiring 87,000 accountants and arming them at the IRS to go after 1000 billionaires to pay their fair share to apply their bottom up economy.Combined the people who need abortions accessible and students that owe money and transgender they helped it almost is as much as the illegal immigrants that have better funds and rights than anyone else on American soil . Now if you vote for them they can show their economic policies they will promise to make Americans lives better later just go by their ideas not performance when they have the power to do it . They can only do it when they have the future if republicans don’t stop them again like this term . Democrats love renaming definitions by adding words together and put it into a bill so it’s officially named! Like planned parenthood as a taxpayer funded department to provide womens healthcare and protect womens reproductive rights by having abortions as a first line of contraception and assisting people to not have families or be parents. And funding climate change? Climate is the study of weather and how it changes over time through gathered data and it’s geographical location!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"DEMOCRATS FOR SOCIALISM , JUST LIKE CUBA !"
OFi73TzEN_8,Abolish republicanism
OFi73TzEN_8,Dems get nothing done because Repubs block all their bills. Saved you from wasting 21 mins watching this video
OFi73TzEN_8,Excellent video. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💕
OFi73TzEN_8,You are the weirdo!
OFi73TzEN_8,Your vote doesn't count. - America!
OFi73TzEN_8,Because the republicans block everything
OFi73TzEN_8,Very red pill video. Indoctronate the youth!!!!
OFi73TzEN_8,Of course you don't mention Republicans blocked the border bill.   At the corrupt request of Trump to his owned Republicans in house and senate.
OFi73TzEN_8,1:24 it's almost af if all these promises can't be fulfilled and liberal cucks vote on feeling rather than reality and what can be done and what needs to be done for a society to work
OFi73TzEN_8,They get nothing done because of republican obstructionism!
OFi73TzEN_8,So you've always pitched to your audience to get behind the CPUSA but now their line is to go vote democrat.  Are you still affiliated with them @secondthought?  Is it safe to say they are no longer a communist party but a group of democrat riding reformists?
OFi73TzEN_8,Show trumps broken promises please and then every other president that was in office prior
OFi73TzEN_8,I disagree a little......democrats can destroy cities and countries pretty well
OFi73TzEN_8,I think it's because they spend so much time campaigning that they are exhausted when it's time to go to work.
OFi73TzEN_8,5:30 is just like Biden saying only God could get him to stop running and then boom 2 weeks later drops out😐
OFi73TzEN_8,Still not making 15 dollars an hour thanks biden🫠😮
OFi73TzEN_8,Lol
OFi73TzEN_8,I wonder how many republicans clicked on this video expecting maga propaganda but instead got socialism
OFi73TzEN_8,Calling the democrats a left party is the first mistake. It's a joke they are considered anything further left than center-right
OFi73TzEN_8,"Everything about being an American embarrasses and disgusts me, genuinely hate it here"
OFi73TzEN_8,Just ignore the 2.4 trillion investment in american manufactoring and infrastructure.
OFi73TzEN_8,bump
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because they don’t care about you, they just act like they do. There, saved you 20 minutes"
OFi73TzEN_8,Two wings one bird!
OFi73TzEN_8,This guy or Trump? I'm sorry for you america.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Holy shit
He went a whole video without bitching about white people

I am in awe"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Biden kept those promised - He simply did not have enough support from  a few  Democrats that served as obstructionists  1) Kristen Synema  ,  2) Joe Manchin  It has to do with Congress and  how many states have gerrymandered Republicans  = guaranteed  seats  plus a SCOTUS  of extremists that   Destroyed Roe vs Wade  but allowed Politicians to take bribes"
OFi73TzEN_8,There’s no such thing as “mild center left policies.” Stop lying..
OFi73TzEN_8,I will bet you will never make a video of the Republican Party. What is the excuse you going to use for Donald Trump not getting his policy and what did he do for his four years?
OFi73TzEN_8,"In all honesty what kills the Republicans is being such a*shole. Stuff like marriage equality, and abortion should be just be aligned in both parties. But no, Republicans keep on coming after the LGBT, and women. As long as those topics are on the plate, people will not really care about economics."
OFi73TzEN_8,Because all they care about above virtue signaling is money and power. But now they want the authority to be able to control everything everyone does. Imagine how awesome this place would be with a two party system
OFi73TzEN_8,"Should title it - Why American Politicians never get anything done. Historically speaking, the Dems have done more than Republicans. However, it isn't near the level we would have needed. I mean, for example, JFK wanted free 😢 other things, but that isn't something Dems or Republicans wanted, and we saw what happened."
OFi73TzEN_8,"They got a lot done.  They allowed 12 million illegals into our country and forgave billions of dollars of stude nt loans that other tax payers had to cover.  They pulled out of Afghanistan and left billions of military equipment, they failed at inteligence on october 7th and they didnt read the room that pressured Russian to invade Ukraine.  Oh.  They got a lot done."
OFi73TzEN_8,This comment section is a joke
OFi73TzEN_8,"Wait im confused, the very first point you make is 15 dollar minimum wage- 

Right now the minimum wage is 16.28 which is a dollar and 28 cents more than promised. He said that like 2022 which is two years ago-"
OFi73TzEN_8,And the one guy who echoes a lot of these same complaints is the guy the media/establishment have spent 8 years telling us is Hitler... Hmmmmmmmm
OFi73TzEN_8,TRUE 💯💯💯👏🏻👏🏻
OFi73TzEN_8,"You think Corp is the enemy of the people, start a good one"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Well, things not getting done without cooperation is baked right into the constitution. Commies often whine about american government being too slow to do things, but it's often because the things they want done are controversial, and often for good reason. The whole point is to prevent unilateral change, and frankly the constitution didn't go far enough to prevent that"
OFi73TzEN_8,Lol can you be more Red?
OFi73TzEN_8,"Interesting Video. I hope this really gets alot of Hits. There are MANY people out there that need GOOD information on what goes on behind these ""Closed-Doors"""
OFi73TzEN_8,Vote robert f kennedy jr to get out of this corporate capture of our federal agencies.
OFi73TzEN_8,The definition of soyboy! Go change your pad!
OFi73TzEN_8,"Amerikkka Doesn’t Have a Government. It Has Rich 🤑 Investors Who Pay Our Leaders to do as They Say. I’ll Say it Again. Amerikkka is Not a Democracy, it’s a Business."
OFi73TzEN_8,Progressive is such a useless word. not every change is for the better
OFi73TzEN_8,"American rooting for socialism is like a chicken rooting for kfc. It makes no sense. How many socialist countries are doing well ? If you people think socialism is that great then go and live in a socialist country for just a year. 

I am an African and most African countries lean towards socialism in terms of economic and fiscal policies. It hasn't helped us at all. The African countries that are doing fairly well are those that lean towards some sort of free market capitalism with less government manipulation.

Despite Africa's social conservatism, our awful economic outlook has crippled us un many ways. I dont understand why some of you Americans are so bent on ruining your great country with economic socialism. Its just a fairytale economic ideology and nothing substantive"
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Democrats and  Republicans is controlled by lobbyist, billionaires and weapons manufacturers. Democrats make promises they can't keep and Republicans keep their promises of taking any gains blacks have gotten."
OFi73TzEN_8,I’m starting to think you guys are selling out
OFi73TzEN_8,America is way too damn conservative

08NGLIV0JLM,"Hello, you.

This is a friendly reminder that:

1. Kamala Harris **will** be the first to reach 270 and become the 47th President of the United States of America.

2. Donald Trump **will** demand that the vote count be stopped in any state, especially Pennsylvania, as long as he is in the lead. He did it in 2020 and he will definitely do it again.

3. Donald Trump **will** declare himself the winner even before all votes are counted. He did it in 2020 and he'll definitely do it again.

4. Donald Trump **will** blame everyone else because he lost the 2024 election instead of blaming himself.

5. Militias **are currently** threatening violence against election officials if they certify Kamala Harris as the winner of this election.

Thank you and good night."

v0euZ7jjy_o,"Trump has to win. He has to. We cannot let the Dems get away with all they have done. They accused him falsely 10,000 times, charged him, jailed him, went after his money, tried to impeach him, charged and jailed his supporters, and tried to assassinate him twice. We must stand up for a man who has stood through it all for us. Trump wins this one hands down. MAGA strong!"

v0euZ7jjy_o,"The Murdoch family and Paul Ryan need to rethink their position on the queer transgender athiest marxist racist bigoted perverted treasonous murderous DNC & DCCC.
They're apparently part of the cartel."
v0euZ7jjy_o,"Brian- tell Mark the election ""expert"" that the Republican  Party has plenty of College educated people so quit acting like we are just low class workers. What a snob! MANY of us have a College Degree. But the Party isn't Communist like the Dem Party is now, so SMART people are going to the Republican Party; the Party of Patriots, NOT Commies!"

v0euZ7jjy_o,Fox lies constantly they were saying this last time 😂
v0euZ7jjy_o,Mark the election expert says Latinos are for Trump because of the economy. Notice how he doesn't mention the main reason: for the most part they are Christians and they don't like her antiChristian policies like ABORTION and pushing TRANSGENDER crap on our kids and her AntiCatholic/ AntiChristian stance
v0euZ7jjy_o,If men don’t vote we will lose
v0euZ7jjy_o,Celebrities aren’t the common middle-class person so who cares what they think or feel? they don’t impress me at all they aren’t paying my bills for me !

v0euZ7jjy_o,Every few years there are some sexual allegations against some hollywood person. Then some powerful top A list celebrity finally announces that the guy assaulted her too. After years of him piling up victims. This is what Rogans endorsement feels like.

v0euZ7jjy_o,I’m praying all day that Trump wins there such lying cheating evil people and I know that they’re going to try to steal this election again. The only difference between now and 2020 is people are more aware of the cheating voting machines going down in Pennsylvania. how convenient a swing state And I can’t stand it when she’s at a rally and people are supporting Trump and she says I am speaking now she sounds like a mother reprimanding children. God this man has to be elected between the inflationary costin this country and illegal immigration we doomed.

FWjcmcHtaDE,"Trump won and the Republicans took the Senate, but they still have the House. Impose tariffs on China and South Korea (money machine). There are nine countries with a trade imbalance of more than $50 billion with the US. Trump should negotiate not only with Europe (Germany, Iceland) and Japan, where there are markets, but also with Canada and Mexico, which are neighboring countries. The US trade imbalance related to South Korea and China should be strongly resolved. Biden has already been fooled by two countries."

FWjcmcHtaDE,Trump 2024 we all need to celebrate the victory worldwide !!!
FWjcmcHtaDE,"Certainly. Here’s a breakdown of the phrase with definitions:

1. Rage – intense, often uncontrolled anger. Rage is more than just anger; it can be an overwhelming force that drives someone to act impulsively or aggressively.


2. Unmoored – lacking stability, connection, or grounding. To be unmoored is to feel adrift or disconnected from a firm foundation, like a boat that’s come loose from its anchor and is now floating aimlessly.



So, when we say, ""Rage is the currency of the unmoored,"" it means that for people who feel disconnected or without a stable foundation, intense anger can become their main way of coping or asserting themselves. Rage can serve as a substitute for deeper meaning or direction, filling the emptiness caused by a lack of stability or purpose."
FWjcmcHtaDE,"Suck sh💩t murdoch.
People want the Truth.
Trump 2024."
FWjcmcHtaDE,Thumbs up if you think Oprah is on the P diddy tapes lol 😆

FWjcmcHtaDE,"People will probably never vote Democrat again,  fine with me."
FWjcmcHtaDE,"The Tories on the east cost will be treated like the Tories were treated during the Revolutionary War. Tories are Tories, even today. People not for America are Tories because their allegiance is to something other than America. Within America Tories are everywhere. It’s hard to identify them. May take some time but they will be identified while they sit in their front room watching TV until they are caught. Cant say how their wife and family will fare but don’t be a Tori."

FWjcmcHtaDE,"Its so sweet to see the FOCKS NEWS hacks running around like panicked rats caught in an election threshing machine. For years they've been backing Russia's interference in
American politics by trying to get Putin's pet guinea pig back into the White House. What are they going to do when the GOP gets rid of the MAGA parasite from its ranks
and returns to some sort of normal, balanced, sane democratic opposition? Anyone interested in an ideologically burnt out, exhausted, exposed .hithole Fakes News factory?"
FWjcmcHtaDE,Sit down and zip it oprah

FWjcmcHtaDE,"Oprah Winfrey calls for the appeal of the 19th amendment she calls to take the vote away from women Oprah Winfrey says take the vote away from women if they don't do what she tells them to do.RLGjr.  you women that listen to Oprah are subjugated! Women or anyone that listens to Oprah Winfrey or her slaves you have no choice you do as you're told you will obey you are a slave subjugated slave do is Oprah says, or you will pay you will lose your vote she will take it away, and the 19th amendment will go to the wayside you will lose it women because Oprah Winfrey said you must,,,Be her slaves."
FWjcmcHtaDE,I had thought after so much accusing of cheating hurled by both ides the voting mode was tightened or improved. After hearing Trump wishing the voting should be through paper ballots and one-day voting I am surprised it's not done so. So I don't think Trump will win - the Democrats are having the upper hand and they will do everything to stop Trump! Sorry for the American people. I suggest they better prepare to endure a Banana Republic systems as they are on the way! Checked.
FWjcmcHtaDE,America needs Trump.
FWjcmcHtaDE,"Congratulation Mr. President Donald Trump :)

s1tzz8gXNzk,"If women vote for Harris simply because she’s a woman and supports abortion, this country is in trouble. If I felt she was qualified to be president, I would have considered voting for her. Her job as ‘border czar’ was abysmal. Nothing to do with her being a woman."

s1tzz8gXNzk,Well I AM A WOMAN AND JULIA’s commercial pissed me off more than anything. As if I have to ask my husband permission for anything. Trump was referring to Venezuelan gangs not Roe Vs Wade. If you are going to quote at least watch the clip yourself and get it right you misinformed chick.
s1tzz8gXNzk,Democrats are also confident because they know they have a plan to steal the election again
s1tzz8gXNzk,Why Juan is there???
s1tzz8gXNzk,"Harris and the entire democratic socialist party have thrown nothing but a hate rally for the past eight years. Hate Trump, Blame Trump, Rah Rah Rah.
No substance, no reality, just a bunch of woke ideology that appeals to the lazy, delusional, brain washed democrats."
s1tzz8gXNzk,"I’ve listened to BOTH CANDIDATES, 99% of all their town halls, and rally’s. 

To me, ANYONE WHO CAN HONESTLY VOTE FOR Kamala, has ZERO COMMON SENSE!  If our country’s number 1 concern is ABORTION, then we have much more to worry about than the Dems saying Trump is going to ruin democracy!  Really??? It’s the Dems who are trying to ruin this country! They have Obama trying to shame black men into voting for who HE WANTS TO WIN, WHAT? I’m sorry, but if he had said that to me, I’d be running to the other side so fast. And, Kamala being so pro abortion, but preaching from a pulpit in a church… WHAT? How can she even walk into a church, with the way she feels, and thinks! YIKES!!!

No, Trump is clearly the ONLY ONE TO SENSIBLY VOTE FOR THIS GO ROUND! Wake up America! The journalist Miranda (sorry I’ve forgotten her last name) has so much information on all the things the left has done, not only to Trump, but also how awful Biden has been to his kids, and our country! 
 
So, I’m praying for Trump, and hoping for the very best!"

s1tzz8gXNzk,"FYI the woman who said “The Kamala campaign is knocking on 2,000 doors a minute, something Elon Musk can’t even touch”, she obviously doesn’t understand numbers. In 24 hours, Elon’s JRE podcast episode has reached 10 MILLION views. Her rate of 2,000 doors per minute would take 3.5 days. Therefore, Elon is 3.5x more effective at getting his message out. So…sorry lady."

s1tzz8gXNzk,"My wife is a white upper middle class advanced degree sixty-four year old.  She folded up her ballot, put it in the envelope, licked and sealed it and said, ""I voted Trump/Vance.""  I about fell off the couch.  She said, ""I'm just not going to vote for Harris.  She's a fake. I dislike lots of stuff about Trump, but look who he's surrounded himself with? Plus, I'm not going to vote for abortions."" I'd say that fairly goes against this lady's narrative."

s1tzz8gXNzk,"I normally don't watch debates, but the last time I watched the Trump/Harris debate, it was a terrible showing for Harris as she never directly answered many of the questions poised to her; and of the course the mods was constantly interrupting Trump. Even before the debates, many people knew where Trump's position on many issues, not so with Harris. It seems that most of the rhetoric is anti-Trump and not on the issues. But got to commend Harris as she was drafted to fill in the void left by Biden; it takes months of planning for a presidential campaign, Harris only had only a few weeks."
s1tzz8gXNzk,Who ever votes for Harris needs to research Trump’s record as POTUS and Harris’ record as VP. It’s clear one did alot more to improve the country while the other did nothing except make everything across the board! Trump 2024 FTW!!

I accelerated by naturalization process, got US citizenship last month and dropped mail in ballot for Trump yesterday. TDS is real and is fueled by the media. Hopefully there are enough that switched to Trump to put him over the edge."

2XC2IZCsukw,"KAMALA HARRIS. DO ANY OF YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT TRUMP HAS PLANNED. HE IS A CONVICTED FELON, AND HE LITERALLY WANTS TO TAKE AWAY RIGHTS. EDUCATE YOURSELFS."
2XC2IZCsukw,💙Harris🇺🇸Walz💙
2XC2IZCsukw,Democrats and Media trying to set up the steal again
2XC2IZCsukw,Fox is so in the pocket of the DNC. MSNBC has closer numbers than Fox.
2XC2IZCsukw,Trump 2025
2XC2IZCsukw,"If Harris wins, America will have deserved what is coming."
2XC2IZCsukw,"Fox is hoping they can get Traitor Trumps cult to watch because they are still paying off Dominion for the lies Fox told during the last election. The one HUGE problem with Democracy is it allows propaganda networks like Fox Fixed Newz & fiends, (along with Rupert Murdoch) to spew hate and lies with no push back.  You hear Fox making up all kinds of excuses where Traitor Trump is losing just to set the cult up for the loss that's coming for Traitor Trump.  President Elect Harris will still try and treat Traitor Trump like a proud American and not a traitor.  Maybe she will not put him in prison if he tells everyone he has been lying to Americans since 2016."
2XC2IZCsukw,"Saying you love America and are voting for Traitor Trump is like saying you love your children, but you’re going to let Hannibal Lecter babysit them."
2XC2IZCsukw,All the people in north Carolina who lost everything and joe/harris give them 700 bucks why would anyone vote for her
2XC2IZCsukw,Melania is filing for divorce right now in Florida.  Just heard from a friend in local gov... WOW!!!
2XC2IZCsukw,Women are going to power Kamala to victory if the exist polling and early voting data is any indication
2XC2IZCsukw,Kamala is for America!! 🇺🇸
2XC2IZCsukw,The media should not get polling results untill voting is over.
2XC2IZCsukw,trump 2024🎉
2XC2IZCsukw,What I don't understand is who are the idiots that vote Democrat nowadays I remember all the dating apps that had all these feminist women on them saying they didn't want trump voters there's a reason your single
2XC2IZCsukw,"No one takes MSM seriously. 

Theres no way this is close, Trump is likely dominating in votes. 

If Trump was even theyd say hes losing 😂😂"
2XC2IZCsukw,I am mexican i vote for trump. Make mexico great again 😊
2XC2IZCsukw,"Dead heat in the polls is great for trump. Not only have polls underestimated trump but they have never NOT underestimated him. He was supposed to beaten in 2016 and he won. He was supposed to be crushed in 2020 and he ""lost"" slightly. Why would i believe all of a sudden the pollsters got trump right? Show me FIRST. Ill go with history and the data it has given us"
2XC2IZCsukw,These polls are wrong! These networks want views but I think Trump is way ahead.
2XC2IZCsukw,"If you think Trump will win, prepare yourselves for the agony of defeat!!!   "
2XC2IZCsukw,I'm just going to say this once and only once vote for Donald Trump if you still want to live in this world want your kids to have a family if you vote for Kamala Harris you will be voting for a third world war I'm talking nuclear war .
2XC2IZCsukw,"I am English guy ( Britain ), i say this to you Americans, if you want your country to go like my country, which it is going like, ( Britain, A SH.THOLE ), then you vote Harris, if you want to save America and stop it going like Britain, you got to vote for DONALD TRUMP. If i was American, i certainly know who i would vote for, DONALD TRUMP ALL THE WAY 👍"
2XC2IZCsukw,"So Trump supporters, how are you going to feel when youre losers again ? Gonna call your fellow countrymen disgusting names & turn into domestic terrorists again ? 😂😂😂"
2XC2IZCsukw,It's a CYA report.
2XC2IZCsukw,End the Trump sht show!
2XC2IZCsukw,So who is gonna win then huh
2XC2IZCsukw,How could it be even close?! Better not be rigged!
2XC2IZCsukw,BS.....
2XC2IZCsukw,"Imagine that, too close to call. All good scripts have plot twist.
It's all Kabuki!"
2XC2IZCsukw,Im in Michigan. Everyone is voting for trump. Who are these phantom other voters?
2XC2IZCsukw,Fox News is such trash now.
2XC2IZCsukw,Both are no good for the country. Is this really the best we’ve got?
2XC2IZCsukw,Trump🎉
2XC2IZCsukw,if elected Vice President Kamala Harris would continue the policies of the Biden administration and thus continue the economic decline and stagnation in the region.
2XC2IZCsukw,Its obviously going to be not trump its a fix
2XC2IZCsukw,Showbox isn't going to give our state-by-state analysis oh I wonder why would it be because you would start crying hey I'm collecting liberal tears over here in Pennsylvania after 35 years as a Democrat I quit
2XC2IZCsukw,Whoever votes for Harris are completely dumb
2XC2IZCsukw,Tomorrow is going to be hilarious no matter who wins it’s gonna be one side saying rigged
2XC2IZCsukw,get ready for it...after trump wins dems set up massive leftist rioting and looting so biden can declare martial law and dems stay in power
2XC2IZCsukw,"Reporter to Trump supporters: what's the biggest thing that bothers you about the economy?
Supporters: the cost of housing and rent.
Reporter: what expertise does Trump have to solve that problem?
Supporter: well he's a real estate tycoon.
Reporter: so he made billions by keeping his rent low?
Supporter: hmm"
2XC2IZCsukw,I believe Donald Trump is further they going to rig the election
2XC2IZCsukw,I am Spiritual 🙏. TRUMP will win 2024 & 2028.
2XC2IZCsukw,"The election process does not determine the President; instead, it is those who possess real authority within the administration who do. We exercised our voting rights despite the flaws, anticipating it will hold significance. We may expect an additional four years of American decline under the same administration that has been in power for the previous four years. Since World War II, we have not existed as a sovereign nation. The misguided claim that America should modernize by electing a woman, akin to Mexico, exemplifies the increasing stupidity in current debate. Examine the motivations for Mexican persons migrating to America if their objective is to replicate conditions in Mexico. Nonetheless, it is irrelevant, as previously mentioned, that individuals who sway government leaders, whom we are made to believe administer America in accordance with the populace's wishes, are not the genuine authority."
2XC2IZCsukw,"The thing is, it doesn't appear anyone in significant numbers is switching to the Democrat side. Yet I have seen a ton of comments from registered democrats that they are voting for Trump. And in PA, if there are 200k more registered Republicans since 4 years ago, that means there are a lot of new registrations and new registrations are almost certainly voting for their registered party. Someone who registered democrat in the 1990s may not chante affiliations but might be voting trump. But I can't imagine anyone registering GOP in the last two years and voting Kamala"
2XC2IZCsukw,LMFAO Where are the republicans criticizing fox news for having to put together two different clips just to get a coherent message from Donald out??
2XC2IZCsukw,So just speaking with the republican here on fox
2XC2IZCsukw,Trump 2024
2XC2IZCsukw,He’s actually winning pretty easily.
2XC2IZCsukw,James Blair looks worried 😂
2XC2IZCsukw,Here in Florida I’m voting tomorrow! 🔴
2XC2IZCsukw,Why is fox saying dead heat it’s a landslide for Trump.
2XC2IZCsukw,"Give me a f..king break ""impossible"" that it's even close.  Videos again of fake ballots been dumped in at night by Dems"
2XC2IZCsukw,We’re not going Back to decisiveness and racism I already voted for Kamala Harris!!!💙💙💙💙🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
2XC2IZCsukw,Vote Trump. Trump 2024
2XC2IZCsukw,Please trump trump win 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣4️⃣❤️❤️❤️❤️ we can’t afford money Pitt Kamala Harris
2XC2IZCsukw,No more Bidenomics and Kamala plans for 4 years. Vote for Trump.
2XC2IZCsukw,"Trump said he could shoot someone and  not lose support? He was openly saying he could do something bad and not lose support . Why would he say that? Because he has done bad things and knows it, but his supporters are too blinded by partisanship to see it. He said it himself. Why would he even bring that up? Let that sink in."
2XC2IZCsukw,Harris wins!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
2XC2IZCsukw,Her illigal immigrants have voted
2XC2IZCsukw,Lmao@Dead heat! Trump 2024 by a landslide!
2XC2IZCsukw,Congrat Kamala👏👏👏
2XC2IZCsukw,Trump will win 🎉🎉🎉🎉
2XC2IZCsukw,It's so frustrating when there are so very very many people that don't want either candidate.
2XC2IZCsukw,It's STUPID to see if this race is even CLOSED :) LMAO
2XC2IZCsukw,I Want to Get Tired of Winning !!
2XC2IZCsukw,"When Donald Drumpf loses in a landslide, make sure you guys send me a cup of your tears. 😂 She's going to win on the female vote alone. These polls on TV aren't showing the truth. She's crushing Drumpf in reality."
2XC2IZCsukw,Who answers polls.
2XC2IZCsukw,I wrote in the name of my Pastor. Could not support Trump with what he tried to do on Jan 6 and his infidelity. Hope you all do the same. God is watching.
2XC2IZCsukw,"PENNSYLVANIA GO VOTE RED! PLEASE WE ABSOLUTELY NEED YOU TO DO THIS!!! 
PENNSYLVANIA GO VOTE RED! PLEASE WE ABSOLUTELY NEED YOU TO DO THIS!!!"
2XC2IZCsukw,Roman Empire is over and so will the USA with Trump
2XC2IZCsukw,"Not possible to call dead heat it's ridiculous 77,000,000 votes and it's even bs"
2XC2IZCsukw,"As an asian, I'm voting for trump. Even I know he's the only best choice for us."
2XC2IZCsukw,Donald trump has to win

voFux7n0GJ8,"from what i understand, there are few, if not none, blue states - just blue cities."
voFux7n0GJ8,fake news😂😂
voFux7n0GJ8,Harris 226/ trump 312. Trump. Won all 7 battleground states. The county by county results is shokingly red but of course the big cities where most of the ghetto and the blacks live were won by harris and nearly every other city won by trump. Look at how red main is.
voFux7n0GJ8,He won every single swing state 😂
voFux7n0GJ8,Remember all the times cnn said kamala was ahead of trump in every poll.
voFux7n0GJ8,The poll sucks by projecting Iowa as blue state......
voFux7n0GJ8,Dem-Party's Propaganda Media Machine 😅😅😅
voFux7n0GJ8,"CNN says Kamala is leading Iowa by 3 points. 

And actual results on election night is as follows:
Trump won Iowa by a whopping 56% 
Kamala     44% 

Go figure that out 😅"
voFux7n0GJ8,Bla bla bla FakeNews FakePolls😅
voFux7n0GJ8,The idea that this was “razor thin” was a fucking LIE.

voFux7n0GJ8,Just keep saying RAZOR thin and maybe one day it will be true.
voFux7n0GJ8,CNN....Communist News Network
voFux7n0GJ8,"Dear mainstream media: you suck at your jobs. It's not just that you are all libtards, it's that you are legitimately terrible at your job. Everything they talked about in this video ended up being wrong. The fact that they even gave that Iowa poll any credibility just proves how awful they are at their jobs. This is why nobody watches your network any more."
voFux7n0GJ8,"TO: CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, and TYT:

WOKE IS FINISHED! DONE FOR! So are you if you continue to support this Marxist Movement and their leaders. There can actually be a ""Rebirth"" to something much better if you choose to re-embrace the Free World Republic our forefathers set up for us almost 250 years ago which has made us the Greatest Nation on Earth (""If it isn't broken, don't fix it""). But that is up to you."
voFux7n0GJ8,Trump won every battleground state 🥴🤣
voFux7n0GJ8,You Stupid Idiot Morons on the Wacko Nut job CNN Communist News Network left are totally out of Touch with the Voters🤣!
voFux7n0GJ8,"Just admi it, government-run media, YOU ARE IRRELEVANT! No one trusts you; you're beyond biased, and We the People are done with all of you pravda-ites."

voFux7n0GJ8,lol!
voFux7n0GJ8,"The Beznau nuclear power plant in Switzerland, Metsamor Plant in Armenia and Fessenheim Plant in France was chosen as the most dangerous reactors in the world due to its design in the 1960s and 1970s . The nuclear reactor should have been close a long time ago. Because it spreads radiation to Europe and other continents. Radioactive and chemical wastes of the Меtsаmоr Nuclear Power Plant enter the Caspian Sea through rivers and then into the oceans through other rivers. The NPP is located in a seismic country and a strong earthquake can occur at any time. Armenia should be sanctioned and embargoed to close this reactor. This environmental terrorism must be stopped. Тhe number of cancer patients in the world is increasing rapidly due to nuclear power plants. The government of Armenia, which is a military-economic ally of the invading Russia аnd receives financial and military support from it, should think about the health of the peoples of Europe. The Prime Minister of Japan said that the chemical and radioactive waste of nuclear power plants in Japan will be discharged into the ocean. As a result of water circulation and rainfall, plants will absorb toxic water. There will be radiation in drinking water and cancer patients will increase. Russia's political and military leadership is planning armed sabotage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Mines are buried in the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from all sides. Explosives are placed inside the reactors. World leaders must stop this ecological disaster"

Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, and Arizona.  Most of the states have 99% in.  California has not moved at all since early morning on the 6th.  Does anyone know what the hold up is?"
voFux7n0GJ8,"With markets tumbling, inflation soaring, the fed imposing large interest- rate hike, while treasury yields are raising rapidly _ which means more red inks for portfolios this quarter.

VP Harris did a flawless campaign. I mean flawless.

I am confident we are waking up to a Madam President.

Do you have your snacks ready?
Ps

I predict she would turn some Red states Blue.
At least 2-4states"
voFux7n0GJ8,Katt Williams is watching

Now your health is no longer at the state level where if you don't like it, you can change it. This woman wants to lower the population. What's to say she won't decide that you  should not  have children or you had too many? At the federal level, you don't have a prayer. She could make a one child policy like another country did. Trump keeping it at the state level, he is truly helping you keep your voice. He is FOR women."
voFux7n0GJ8,I’m Japanese so I can’t vote but I hope trump wins

voFux7n0GJ8,I’d bet Dollars to Donuts that it’ll magically come down to Pennsylvania. Kinda like in 2001 the World Series was NY Yankees vs NY Mets. Strange after 9/11 2 NY teams in WS?
voFux7n0GJ8,"It’s definitely magic because we all know there is no such thing as “real”, Magic! Kinda like your Polls & Make-Believe MAP. Weird how that turned out, huh?"
voFux7n0GJ8,For Trump in WI today 🇺🇸
voFux7n0GJ8,"Hurricanes Helene & Milton devastated NC  FL-- Kamala at elite campaign fundraisers in CA, while emergency lineworker crews were invited to stay at Trump's Doral Miami resort for free. Big difference -- Trump actually does things. Kamala is a cackling puppet"
voFux7n0GJ8,This is like the world cup of idiots for idiots. Pretty cool though. I'm following this shit closely. Yea yea ok fuck it I'm an idiot too.
voFux7n0GJ8,"Nevadas don't become California look Kamala ruined. Save our Silver State, Vote for Trump. Do you like your gas cars? Vote for Trump. Do you like your gas stoves? Vote for Trump. Nevadas are Sin City. Our Strip is ruined, no more fun. Vote for Trump. Save our country."
voFux7n0GJ8,Don’t worry.    She’ll “find some more votes”
voFux7n0GJ8,Trump literally called two generals losers last night on tv.    Absolutely disgusting behaviour.  Especially in the month of November.     Harris 2024
voFux7n0GJ8,King trump❤❤❤❤❤❤trump❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
voFux7n0GJ8,Epstein' s list are fear.
voFux7n0GJ8,TRUMP 2024
voFux7n0GJ8,From Mexico I hope TRUMP win ALL the way
voFux7n0GJ8,Praying for Trump to win ...enough of this wokeness and illegals killing us!!
voFux7n0GJ8,I was Democrat not no more this is not my party
voFux7n0GJ8,TRUMP 24 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
voFux7n0GJ8,Why are they so desperate to put Kamala ahead
voFux7n0GJ8,"When you see the final numbers, you’re going to be shocked, it’s going to be Trump in a landslide"
voFux7n0GJ8,CNN is bias
voFux7n0GJ8,"💰According to the SportsHandle Election Odds Tracker, Trump has a 57.8% probability rate of winning the 2024 United States Election as of Tuesday August 6, 2024 while Harris has a 48.3% probability rate of winning.

2024 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BETTING ODDS

voFux7n0GJ8,Kamala won
voFux7n0GJ8,PRAY PRAY PRAY FOR AMERICA!!!!!
voFux7n0GJ8,WHEN I LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MY FRIENDS THAT ARE DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN THE DEMOCRATS OVERWHELMINGLY ARE MOVING OVER TO TRUMP THERE ARE NO TRUMP VOTERS MOVING TO HARRIS NOT ONE. PEOPLE THAT I'VE ASKED IN STORES CLERKS PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HARRIS ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP THEY BELIEVE HARRIS IS A COMMUNIST OR MARXIST THEY SAID THEY WITNESSED HER SPEAKING ABOUT HER POLICIES AND THEIR MARXIST. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT WHEN I ASKED THAT QUESTION. A LADY A CLERK I'VE TALKED TO FOR YEARS AS A CLERK SAID SHE NEVER VOTED FOR REPUBLICAN AND SHE IS NOW BEING FORCED TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. NEVER HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE PERSON TO PERSON. AND IT'S NOT EVEN AN EXAGGERATION. SHE'S VOTING FOR HER POCKETBOOK SHE HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN'S POLICIES AND THEY SEE IT THEY CAN FEEL IT
voFux7n0GJ8,Who is winning in heaven? They are voting there today cause they dont believe in early voting.

voFux7n0GJ8,Nothing but bots in the comments. We really do live in the matrix.
voFux7n0GJ8,COMMUNIST NETWORK NEWS
voFux7n0GJ8,CNN sucks
voFux7n0GJ8,Don’t vote trump he will make all Americans poor and he’s a criminal
voFux7n0GJ8,Trump 2024!!! CNN is wrong the election is not razor thin. What's razor thin is their emotions and feelings.
voFux7n0GJ8,Mark my words they gonna pull a fast one on trump.. again
voFux7n0GJ8,This doesn’t make sense. Why would she have more votes with 2 states than Trump at 6 more states?! Makes absolutely ZERO sense! The dude is full of s**t! … please dont let this woman ruin our country again for the love of god 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️🇺🇸❤
voFux7n0GJ8,It all comes down to Pennsylvania then
voFux7n0GJ8,FKH! Trump all day!💪🇺🇸💪🇺🇸💪🇺🇸💪🇺🇸MAGA🇺🇸
g34CFjEFZts,Hahahahaha🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
g34CFjEFZts,How did 5 million people watch this guy not talk for hours? Waych Red Ragle on election nights. He knows every tace and doesn't act like a scolded child when things don't go his way.  How is this popular with anyone???
g34CFjEFZts,"Well, what kind of reaction can we expect from Brian? This is the same guy who, two days before this video, posted another video claiming that Donald Trump caused ""fatal"" damage to his own campaign by daring to insult Nancy Pelosi, ""one of the most respected and revered women in Washington D.C. and possibly the most famous speaker in American history"".

You and your followers are so unbelievably out of touch with how the average American thinks and wants, Brian, that it's honestly really sad. Amusing, but sad nonetheless."
g34CFjEFZts,"The amount of people in the comments saying Trump is going to deport the Latinos that voted for him are insane. You do realize they're legal citizens, right?"
g34CFjEFZts,"Iowa 🤣🤣🤣

Hope you're never taken seriously again"
g34CFjEFZts,"To all the democrats that can't fathom how Trump won. I will tell you that it's because you have been brainwashed. The MSM and Youtubers like Brian spread propaganda constantly. They have lied about Trump non-stop, and unless you get your news from somewhere like X, you will be misled. Now they have you all scared to death because of the lies they told you about Trump. I can assure you that Trump just saved America from certain doom. You brainwashed sheep were about to allow the whole world to move here and turn America into a real shithole."
g34CFjEFZts,Alors l IOWA 😂😂😂😂
g34CFjEFZts,😂😂😂😂😂 MAGA 🤡🫵🏻
g34CFjEFZts,Les commentaires de gauchistes aux cheveux bleus me font un bien fou merci depuis Paris !
g34CFjEFZts,laughing at everyone in the live chat that claiming that Trump cheated. You guys are a threat to democracy.
g34CFjEFZts,Suck it easy 🤣🤣keep working hard to keep this result continue 🙏
g34CFjEFZts,Trump is your DADDY !! 😂
g34CFjEFZts,The Trump landslide just goes to show how out of touch Brian's world view is with the average American.
g34CFjEFZts,Lol
g34CFjEFZts,Jack smith need to wake up
g34CFjEFZts,Judge you need to wake up because they are ready cheating
g34CFjEFZts,Lol Im laughing at how ppl are saying Democracy is dead. Democracy won it worked lol. Democracy isnt going anywhere. Trump was already President for 4 yrs he didnt destroy Democracy. LOL
g34CFjEFZts,Haha! Priceless! My condolences to all the losers here.😂
g34CFjEFZts,COMPLETE AND UTTER DELUSION
g34CFjEFZts,Trump derangement syndrome.  It's real
g34CFjEFZts,SUCK IT LOSERS
g34CFjEFZts,"watching days after election. all the dead air LOLOL and the ASMR of him drinking.
then he said: we're likely not going to have the results in PA...some news here...Fox News called PA for Trump 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 then he said Democrats have also won the Senate 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Brian Tyler Pakman and David Cohen - they were better than rewatching Cenk from 2016"
g34CFjEFZts,"God at around the 2 hour 30 minute mark you explain how you want to make D/C and Puerto Rico states, end the phillbuster, and stack the supreme court. And you call Trump a facist huh?"
g34CFjEFZts,"I'm here for the meltdown
😂😂😂😂😂"
g34CFjEFZts,"I can understand the people claiming they are going to leave the US.  I was making plans for Croatia or somewhere else in Eastern Europe if Kamala won knowing she would import 20-50 million more third worlders like the Biden administration did.  I knew the country would be permanently gone with the endless supply of third world droolers available to import and become reliable Democrat voters.  I guess one thing we learned from this election is that they can't use Hispanics any more LOL.

 I guess it comes down to how you want to live your life.  I'm not a fan of home invasions, having 12 year olds get raped, killed, and thrown in a ditch, feces on the streets, and a government that comes in weapons drawn to kill a guy's pet squirrel. 


You guys continue to fixate on Trump Trump Trump.  Maybe one day you'll figure it isn't about Trump.  It never was. He is simply the willing vessel. He is the radiation pellet injected into the cancer that is DC to keep the body of the America alive for another day."
g34CFjEFZts,This is what happened when you called people garbage everyone is pissed 😂
g34CFjEFZts,"10:48 LOL famous last words.

g34CFjEFZts,😂well he’s president now omg
g34CFjEFZts,Holy shit this dude can pound some water
g34CFjEFZts,just fun to watch people being super wrong and arrogance destroyed
g34CFjEFZts,im here for the meltdown
g34CFjEFZts,"Enjoy the red wave. You earned it.

Maybe next time try getting out of your echo chamber, you might realized you guys pushed the average American out by being awful people to those that don’t agree with every single one of your outlandish viewpoints.

Edit: 7:43:35 lol. The moment you realize that Americans are tired of this “movement.”"
g34CFjEFZts,"We Need More people to Speak Up!   100k of Utubers like Brian please😊  Thank you to Sooo many people Around the World 🌎 
  The World has heart.💯💖🫶"
g34CFjEFZts,"Ty. 💙🇺🇸💙 We need more ppl to speak up! 
-> Without Fear of retribution.  & Remember we ARE Humans on the Same Ship.🌎🌎🌏"
g34CFjEFZts,Go woke go broke
g34CFjEFZts,"Democracy is great until it’s not in my favor. If it’s people I don’t like get the majority of the country is stupid and I’m right all the time. The majority of the country is racist, bigoted and sexist. Please vote for me!

That’s what you sound like"
g34CFjEFZts,TRUMP 2024 WOOHOOOOOO MAGA 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
g34CFjEFZts,Watch from 7:42:00 😊😊
g34CFjEFZts,"Who else was switching between this live stream, alan lichtman, david pakman's live stream and laughing?"
g34CFjEFZts,BTC is a commie propagandist moron.  Take the loss hard and savor it losers.  #Trump4547
g34CFjEFZts,"The map at the very beginning having PA in deep blue tells u everything you need to know about this channel😆
In fact the early voting data looked terrible for dems before election day and anyone with common sense would know they were in big trouble there."
g34CFjEFZts,Did he fall in the toilet?
g34CFjEFZts,He's probably screaming in the restroom.
g34CFjEFZts,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
g34CFjEFZts,You really though she was gonna win? GTFOH
g34CFjEFZts,When does he start crying on the stream? 😂
g34CFjEFZts,Post election up date
g34CFjEFZts,Lost. Loser. Landslide. Go away Brian.
g34CFjEFZts,"DearBro.  Investors have been following forctwocrears. (At least) now.  But we lost brother.  Not by much but we still lost.
What next?  Maybe you should go tour the world even Kathmandu.  But when you come back you have got to change your focus,  How do you get the Peckerwoods of the USA to listen to you?  And maybe change their minds.  All the rest is masturbatory nonsense."
g34CFjEFZts,Here to watch the cope🤣
g34CFjEFZts,"Democrats:  The Russians rigged the polls and we still have a ""path to victory"" in Pennsylvania 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣"
g34CFjEFZts,"""You wont hear from the vice president tonight, but you will hear from her tomorrow morning"" 😂😂😂"
g34CFjEFZts,Brian you have egg on your face
g34CFjEFZts,"""red mirage"" 😂😂😂"
g34CFjEFZts,"""It will take only a few days to call the race in Pennsylvania"" That didnt age well lol."
g34CFjEFZts,This was amusing watching the leftists get destroyed in this election.
g34CFjEFZts,I love only Republicans are watching this now.
g34CFjEFZts,"And the PA senate seat fell too. Even in 2026, it’s gonna be difficult to get even 1 branch legislation. The easy part for trump is over. The hard part of fixing this country and its policies begins. There is two tragedies in life, the first comes from not getting what you want; the second, getting it. Many republicans are united in their ideas of fixing the economy and the U.S. immigration policy. But a lot of them have different ideas on how to approach it. If the GOP cannot rally together on legislation and ideas in the same way they did on ideals, it will be their downfall. But if they can, the sky is the limit."
g34CFjEFZts,Don't assume Trump will be gone after 2028.   He already said he will eliminate the US Constitution.  That means Trump can stay as President forever and then pass it on to his son. It will be a monarchy.
g34CFjEFZts,"""We still have the blue wall"" LOOOL"
g34CFjEFZts,"Love the coping here, another video to enjoy and laugh at."
g34CFjEFZts,♡
g34CFjEFZts,I just want to laugh 😂😂😂😂
g34CFjEFZts,Just wanted to say Brian this was the best 8 hours ever 😂. Thank you. I could literally see you holding back tears 🤣🤡. Thank you for this. Al probably watch again tomorrow 😂😁🇺🇲
g34CFjEFZts,Trump 2024 🎉
g34CFjEFZts,Goog night hey Brian 😂😂😂😂😂😂
g34CFjEFZts,Brain is a FRAUD
g34CFjEFZts,Liar liar pants of fire. You FRAUD
g34CFjEFZts,go woke go broke
g34CFjEFZts,"To everyone here, I’m sorry the candidate you are rooting for did not win. But we do need to have an honest conversation and ask ourselves important questions. The truth is you were deceived. The people on your side have lied to you, taught you to hate a man who I also agree is no knight or saint, who speaks at a 3rd grade level but is in no way a fascist or hitler. I hope you are honest and sincere enough to come out of your echo chamber and stop limiting yourself to only left leaning media and hopefully make the effort to hear what the other side has to say. Stop demonizing them, your condescension and attitude of moral superiority will not help. If anything, it will only ensure they win over and over again. And more people will leave the left. I hope this helps."
g34CFjEFZts,"You need to relook you platform. Clearly, the vast majority is not listening to it."
g34CFjEFZts,Presstitute
g34CFjEFZts,"Ahhhh hahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂Lol 
😂😂😂Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂ahhhh hahahaha 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉"
g34CFjEFZts,"When a country shows you who it is, you best believe it"
g34CFjEFZts,My comments later
g34CFjEFZts,He did accept the nomination before votes counted so thats one thing he said hed do.
g34CFjEFZts,Lots of people will regret not voting
g34CFjEFZts,Trump will turn his back on you. Just wait for it. Project 2025 isn't a democratic punishment is an all American punishment. Meaning everyone. All the regrets are coming wait for it. Men are cowards
g34CFjEFZts,I know one thing no man had his rights taken away bc they're the ones who took it away. That either being there moms wives sisters and most sadly there daughter's.  Maga men took there own daughter's rights away. How sad ia that. Let sink in when trump turns his back on you.
g34CFjEFZts,John stewart 2028.
g34CFjEFZts,Everyone maga supporter. Tell me 1 thing trump did to help you? Name one of his policies he talked about. He talked concepts.  He has no plan. Tell me now what has he done to help you. Are you rich now.
g34CFjEFZts,You seriously thought brian was gonna know the way things would turn out. Its not his job. He never once said yup shes gonna win. Not one time did he do that.
g34CFjEFZts,"I feel sad and alone. My daughters feel abandoned. Men not all hate women. The 'bro code"" is real and scary. Lets stick together ppl were gonna need it."
g34CFjEFZts,isnt funny how no one wants to move to mexico? everyone is moving to canada. its almost like the 2020 election was rigged brian. thats why u needed a week to keep counting elections. hey brian is the dem party dictators? for inviting a dictator to commiefornia? trump has never done that. now who is election deniers? the left accepts defeat. by saying putin has won. and everyone is racist and sexist.
g34CFjEFZts,its almost like democrats had nothing but abrotion. and muh trump. we lost everyones racist and sexist. we offer nothing but its the peoples fault. not razor thin trump landslide. evil is leaving power. Christ is the King of Kings. the Alpha and the Omega. the Beginning and the End. im seeing lots of claims of cheating.
g34CFjEFZts,Trump!
g34CFjEFZts,I am a legal immigrant. I promise you I will never vote Democrat
g34CFjEFZts,"Thank you very much Brian, for doing your job and doing it well! Take care of yourself. We're going to need you!!"
g34CFjEFZts,"This is funny watching him slowly realizing Harris is going to lose and he keeps saying ""we still have the blue wall"" 😂😂😂"
g34CFjEFZts,"What about they call California for Harris when it was 55% report, and only 75 % for WA? Who tried to sealed the election first ?"
g34CFjEFZts,Yay go trump! 🎉😂 you are all on the wrong side of history and I relish in all your tears 😂
g34CFjEFZts,"Yes, you all at Meidas, BTC, Pakman, Luke Beasley, Gabe, Antony Davis, Adam Mockler, PoliticsGirl, so many optimistic voices—you all have inspired me to be hopeful. 

The grace with which we approach defeat (no matter how unjust) has been a motivator for me, and I am super grateful. Fear and hatred may win now, but love and hope will prevail. Thank you! 

(I’m from Canada, and a white, cis dude 🇨🇦 so I only experience the agony and trauma vicariously and indirectly). Keep well everyone 💜💙 I’m sorry."
g34CFjEFZts,"To all the people devastated by the news, Trump still cares about you and he will fight for a better life for everyone no matter how much you hate him"
g34CFjEFZts,"@07:51:00. As a former centre liberal who used to be a part of the “Never Trump” derangement syndrome and long time subscriber of this channel…

I’m so glad he got in.  You’ve been fed lies and falsehoods.  Wake up.  There is a reason why it was a clean sweep.  Come to the other side and see the big picture.  You’re all brainwashed.  

❤ a former liberal and follower of this channel. This is a great day."
g34CFjEFZts,"RAMEKJOE...I DO MY HOMEWORK, MY RESEARCH. I STAND BY OUR PEOPLE THAT NEEDS A CANDIDATE THAT WILL BE THRRE FOR THE PEOPLE.

g34CFjEFZts,One love
g34CFjEFZts,So appreciative of you! Thank you for all you do!
g34CFjEFZts,"I am a Lifelong Republican...but Trump changed my mind. I now put People over Party..for the people, of the people, and by the people. Trump through his last Presidency helped me to see the error of my way. We are a beautiful Free Nation and all people, all parties in our nation are important. VP KAMALA HARRIS helped me to see the importance of our nation trying to come together for the Best Candidate possible.🌈👨‍👩‍👧🇺🇸💙💕 May God Bless Her Always!!!"
g34CFjEFZts,"I really love these reactions😂 
MAGA-MAZING🥊🥊💯"
g34CFjEFZts,7:46:00 “one thing that I can say is that a lot of people worked really hard for this not to happen” - that statement would have to go down history as the biggest understatement in the history of literally anything! 😂
g34CFjEFZts,How funny that he put up Kamala’s win on the map first up 😂 loser
g34CFjEFZts,"There is no justice, a criminal became president and turd still haven’t faced any consequences for his actions. Hell, he will still get away with committing a cold murder on a clear day and people will still vote for him. I am done with voting in this country."
g34CFjEFZts,horrible day for the entire world
g34CFjEFZts,"Time to unsubscribe from all these channels.
Nothing good comes from the information given"
g34CFjEFZts,You talked shit and ignored all her wrong doings
g34CFjEFZts,Really wish Jon Stewart would run for president
g34CFjEFZts,All the propaganda you produce for the machine it completely failed hàhaha.
g34CFjEFZts,So happy
g34CFjEFZts,"AMERICA HAS PROVEN TO THE WORLD TO BE DUMB, UNEDUCATED, ILLITERATE IGNORANTR, AND A CORRUPTED COUNTRY.  RIP DEMOCRACY"
g34CFjEFZts,HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!
g34CFjEFZts,7:44:10 This is my favorite part
g34CFjEFZts,Trump 2024....let that sink in liberals
g34CFjEFZts,"Hi Brian
Do you think the Republicans that Endorsed Kamarla and Walz, now that the Democrats have lost, do u think they are going to start their own Party ?"
g34CFjEFZts,"I'm so damn disappointed. I'm an Australian, looking from the outside in, hoping some logic and humanity leaks into the negativity driven Trump crowd. To all the Americans that thought clearly, and voted for what was best for your country, I can only give my best, wish you healing in what you go through, and strength in facing what lies ahead. Take care of yourselves guys, and never lose hope for a better future"
g34CFjEFZts,"I hate when competent, hardworking, and well meaning individuals are to told to reflect on why they “loss”.

Trump, the millions that voted for him, and those that sat out for yet another election never reflect on how they are contributing to the problem. When will they be held accountable? When will people stop supporting their companies and businesses? How many people were/are willing to boycott X/Twitter (unionist others)?

It is absolutely exhausting holding others up that refuse to do their part. As a minority I witnessed other minorities thinking that they are better, different, or the exception of the rule…. Some will even participate in oppressing other minorities but they want people to protect their group.

I agree that some of the mainstream media contributed to the problem. But so are the extremist media, social media, and tabloid media pretending to be real journalists! 

Fort the next four years I am going to intensely focusing on my personal self-care. At the end of the day we only get one life; I believe in being my “brother’s keeper”, but I won’t let my brother drown me while I am trying to help save them!

Be well everyone😊!"
g34CFjEFZts,"Remember Remember the fifth of november, the gunpowder treason and plot. i believe the people should not be afraid of its government, the government needs to be afraid of its people, so its time to remind them. our founding fathers created the 2nd amendment so that the government shall remain afraid of us. lets remind them. guy fawkes was not a man he is an idea, and an idea is worth more than man. worth more than me. worth more than you. lets make them remember"
g34CFjEFZts,"The terrible result is all the Dems fault over 25 years: Gore, Kerry, Hillary and Harris.  When will they learn that highly competent but unlikeable candidates don't win presidential elections."
g34CFjEFZts,You should flee the country before the roundups start in January.
g34CFjEFZts,"Brian is people like you with all ur lies and gaslighting that made this trump reelection possible, so thank u."
g34CFjEFZts,Trash
g34CFjEFZts,This channel was simply just a propaganda machine full of lies and mischaracterisations. I hope people can see the truth now that we have the results.
g34CFjEFZts,"Gaslit by the democrats.  Gaslit by the mainstream media.  It really appears that America is actually really conservative and only looking for a white man for president, certainly, not a woman, and most certainly not a woman of color.  This is the REAL America.  So Sad.  Dems screwed themselves by gaslighting and running too woke a campaign."
g34CFjEFZts,"The 🐓🐓🐓 come home to roost!!! Wow, Harris and Walls couldn’t even come close to hitting Bidans numbers from 2020.

I bet you and the Democratic Party had a primary after Bidan was out of the race 😂😂😂"
g34CFjEFZts,At least we still have football to distract us from this steaming pile of bullshit.
g34CFjEFZts,"Happy meltdown, everyone🎉"
g34CFjEFZts,🤡
g34CFjEFZts,Time to go out and get a real job soy boy 😂😂
g34CFjEFZts,Ha !
g34CFjEFZts,"8:20:11 whoaaa…. Time out! When Donald Trump said fight after he was damn near killed and shot in the head, Democrats had a heart attack and said that’s the wrong message! What are you implying here, sir? Are you implying that you’re gonna fight the results of the election? You left clowns r so lost! She lost cuz u guys LIE and call him hitler and ppl see thru it!! That’s y u lost and not only lost u got ur clock cleaned 😂"
g34CFjEFZts,8:19:08 oh look he’s already starting with the foreign interference bullshit😂
g34CFjEFZts,8:18:38 you don’t know why you guys lost? How about because you keep calling someone who never killed anybody Hitler? Start with that liberal freaks
g34CFjEFZts,Anyone here to witness the soyboy fallout??
g34CFjEFZts,I think President Joe Biden should resign promoting Kamala Harris to president.  She becomes 47.  Trump does Trump.  President Harris has fun nominating her Vice-President.  We could enjoy her awesomeness.  It would a fabulous moment in history.
g34CFjEFZts,"Young males have been overlooked in VP Harris’ campaign. Elon Musk on Trump’s team appeals to males of all ages. He has a proven track record, of positive contribution to humanity. I believe males are attracted to young talented males. Professor Scott Calloway is someone the Democrats should employ to direct democrats campaign."
g34CFjEFZts,Best election day since 2016!
g34CFjEFZts,I can't stop crying...
g34CFjEFZts,"Someone please tell me that it's possible to keep him from taking office. If we fight back and protest in the streets, will he call on his armed sycophants to open fire on us? How do we stop him and Project 2025? I am starting to feel suicidal. They will cut or take away my social security and medicare. They, with the billionaire by his side, take away what I have left of my money. Over the last two years I have lost my fiancé and our home of 18 years. I don't want to lose my children at the hands of the Magakillers."
g34CFjEFZts,Why so quiet Brian?😂
g34CFjEFZts,"If you can tolerate being even more depressed:  you should read Lucinda Roy's book: The Freedom Race because America's future is headed in the direction that the Trumpers, MAGAs, and The Heritage Foundation always wanted--for decades."
g34CFjEFZts,"This goofy lying fake news loving propagandist got crushed! Relied on fake polls, fake news, and propaganda until the last minute just like all of the other delusion liberal clowns thinking they could thwart the will of the people with a barrage of fake news, downplaying Trump's crowds and popularity, and gaslighting Democrats into believing Kamala is a god, Trump's team is ""panicking"" and people are flipping to her in droves... Was any of it true? Nope. How can you trust this absolute buffoon after essentially every prediction and every video he spews is based on a false narrative created by the DNC and leftwing propaganda? If you ever want Democrats to win in future elections, its time to drop propagandists like this piece of 🦮💩and start over from the ground up. Democrats are at a political dead end with their current regime & next election, you're not going to have Trump to blame everything on and convince people the Republican candidate is a fascist. Time to get real liberal dummies."
g34CFjEFZts,Come here to read coping comments. And yes i would do the same to right wingers had trump lost
g34CFjEFZts,Has it ever crossed your mind that Trump used his rich and influential friends to rig the election results? He’s always said if he loses the election will be rigged. He was so sure he would win. How would he be so sure unless he was able to doctor the results.
g34CFjEFZts,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
g34CFjEFZts,MAGA kicked your Trump hating but.
g34CFjEFZts,"Funny. For someone who complains about voting fraud, getting every swing state seems off…"
g34CFjEFZts,❤
g34CFjEFZts,You are an inspiration to us all. It’s sad to see that ‘corrupted media’ are now choosing who will be President
g34CFjEFZts,"Brian, Your liberal agenda has failed! Bow down to President Trump!!"
g34CFjEFZts,"Well lookie there, our democracy is intact and it worked! ❤"
g34CFjEFZts,"Thank you Brian for your efforts, staying up all night, you are just awesome. You have even tried to calm your dog in the midst of all what happened. Loive you, keep up this wonderful work what you are doing♥"
g34CFjEFZts,You talk about weapons of war but YOU NEVER REALIZED JOE BIDEN SEND SHITLOAD OF MONEY ON WAR WEAPONS NO ONE WANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
g34CFjEFZts,NANANANA HEYBHEY GOODBYE
g34CFjEFZts,If you don’t get off your asses to vote this is what happens. The Democratic vote was down almost 20%
g34CFjEFZts,"NOT A TRUMP VOTER!  But Ive always found BTC to be one of the most delusional people on the left side of youtube.
TYT is more realistic with the audience."
g34CFjEFZts,My kids voted for Trump  💔💔 my grown kids that each hv 2kids 😭😭😭😭

g34CFjEFZts,Your kindness and professionalism is heart warming
g34CFjEFZts,"Oh, look the maggots are already on here talking like the idiots they are…if they wanted a dictator, they should have moved….Trump is ABSOLUTELY NOT what America is about….they will find that out soon enough"
g34CFjEFZts,L
g34CFjEFZts,"PLEASE tell us there is still a chance, no matter how small.    Final counts?  Is there any chance of a swing state recount? Or finding something, anything at all that might flip a swing state or more???

Also, with 3 more months,  why can't certain court cases move forward to prove that trump is not eligible to hold office? Like inciting the insurrection? How about stealing documents including secret ones?  treason? Electors? Anything at all??

At least inciting the insurrection!!! 

There must be a way?"
g34CFjEFZts,Brian I’m thrilled to see you comfortable out of your suit. I was thinking that last night. We love you Brian. 💙
g34CFjEFZts,U still continue to lie even now. Yet u dont see how u lost the election with your lies. U re doing exactly the same things that lost u the elections
g34CFjEFZts,"I’m just disappointed. The election wasn’t stollen, they got their 4 years. Don’t let this stop you all from reporting and pressing people in charge."
g34CFjEFZts,GOD BLESS AMERICA AND PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!! THANK YOU JESUS 🙌🙌🙌❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
g34CFjEFZts,"Cant believe It , But A combination of  ignorance  , Interference from a foreign country , and Blind  Belief in what is read or seen on the internet and To an extent Bigotry has made A convicted felon the President of the United states ,  and yet people  voted him in . Sad .  But I wonder How Much more of the Carnival Barker America can Take ,  And  Yet people really  think he will be better   for US , What have we become and by whose hands when we believe the LIAR ,. America is better than  this , and unfortunately the Middle class is Going to Have to pay for all of it .  Theres No perfect way to describe this but,   people voted for him and You get what you get .  He wont know what hes doing and will inherit all the Best aspects  of the previous administration , Take  credit for what he didn't do and lie about the rest Like he did before  But In January Schecky Greene will have the Podium ,  and it wont be Funny .  , Thank you Brian for everything ,"
g34CFjEFZts,Well this has been a fun little movie.
g34CFjEFZts,"Thank you for everything you have done and will continue to do. I’m taking some time to recover from this horrible news. But, how we move forward, collectively… this matters! Be good to yourselves, everyone. Stay kind and respectful. We can and will continue to good fight."
g34CFjEFZts,😂😂
g34CFjEFZts,"God spare the life of this man twice, democrats weaponized the justice system and the media against him. Moral of the history..... Human can try all we can, but the ultimate power rest in the Almagthy hands. May our father bring us together, live in harmony so we can make of 🇺🇸 a better place for our future generation. 
Shalom brothers and sisters."
g34CFjEFZts,Thank you for trying Brian.
g34CFjEFZts,7:59:38 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
g34CFjEFZts,"7:45:11 Brian was so shocked that Trump won, he actually said Democrats won the senate.  It will be okay my friend.  Just take a deep breath."
g34CFjEFZts,"Sorry bro, that's just how democracy goes sometimes."
g34CFjEFZts,I hope Puerto Rico votes for independence now
g34CFjEFZts,I’m so sick. It’s heartbreaking.

e-1pJkuFTpA,"What a wonderful day for democracy! 😊
Shame The Times, a former newspaper, stopped transmitting when it became apparent President Trump would win. That’s basically why I stopped buying the Times after being a lifetime reader."
e-1pJkuFTpA,I watched this all day then it went blank. Why remove it before it was over. Did the person who made this become mad because trump won and erased the board. I want to see the board.
e-1pJkuFTpA,Rage quit 😂
e-1pJkuFTpA,I'm very happy for the USA and that Tramp won. I hope he and a strong USA will continue to support Ukraine so that they can be free of Russians. Many people won't read what I'm writing but I still hope that the USA and Tramp will help in Chechnya too. Russians have been killing us for 400 years and we don't have anyone who can help us. Thank you USA 😊
e-1pJkuFTpA,Harris is not deserve for president.
e-1pJkuFTpA,"For those complaining that they took the stream down because Trump won, this particular channel is right-leaning, meaning they would probably support Trump."

It's already starting, with the election of Trump, Europe is at risk of falling into a war with Russia, something Putin has been waiting 10 years for.
Threat of war from Russia: EU report recommends hoarding food.
A report by the European Union recommends that citizens stock up on food and water for at least 72 hours. The reason: fear of a threat of war from Russia.
The report recommends that EU citizens stock up on food, medicine, water and a flashlight.
The report describes that there is no precise plan as to how the EU would react if Russia attacked one of the EU states.
The purchase of power generators and solar panels is also recommended.

e-1pJkuFTpA,"Я так и не понял, чего стрим вырубили?"
e-1pJkuFTpA,"A liar, a fraud, a convicted criminal – is this truly the only choice the majority of Americans see for themselves? America, aren’t you losing your way? Who will be the next president – a drug lord, a serial killer? What reasonable person can honestly understand such a decision?

If this is the new political norm, one must ask: is this where we all start lying, cheating, and taking the criminal path, pushing through at any cost – even if it means using force? And all in the name of creating a “better America” and building a monument to oneself. Is this an upside-down world or the new normal?

A large part of America prays for God’s protection, while serving dark forces – or at the very least, tolerating their influence. Entertainment reigns over realpolitik. So don’t be surprised if God leaves you; you had the choice. Claiming later that you didn’t see this coming will hardly seem credible. America, on its way toward a totalitarian state, and all with a warning label! Perhaps you don’t even care. You might as well throw out your moral compass; in your Trumpian bubble, it seems to serve no purpose anymore."
e-1pJkuFTpA,USA 🤮
e-1pJkuFTpA,"Trump will put things in war again. It likes he will do again. What US and Soviet Union did in world war 2. That's why he will be friend to Putin again.
Anyway. Choosing Haris, Trump is just like choosing worse or much worse
Haris will be just like any other temporal president.
Trump will be a dictator. And he will show his legacy by war.
Having a dictator will probably a big damage for the country. Than what a permanent president can do. That still recoverbavol.

One thing TO REALLY “LOVE!!!” ❤ABOUT THIS YEARS ELECTION….

All that money the TRILLION that the demoncrats stole from Americans in higher gas prices and higher food costs and what they laundered through ukraine BACK TO THEMSELVES, for such as THIS election …. IS ALL FOR NOUGHT!!!! They just threw it ALLLLLLLLL AWAY AND HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT!!!😂😂😂😂😂

NOW THATS POETIC JUSTICE!!! As the Bible says, “reaping what you sow!!!” And their “harvest” of “rewards” for all their wickedness has JUST BEGUN!!!

As for your comment “nobody”… “THOUGHT”….President Trump would WIN in 2020…. Not sure what crowd you were running with, the WRONG ONE to be sure!!! Listening to tooooo many fake newscasters like cnn probably! 

I not only said often ahead of time that I knew God was raising up President Trump to be President I gave the two reasons why…
1.) To be like Nehemiah in the Bible and build a wall of protection. A whole book of the Bible is dedicated to principles of leadership called Nehemiah.

2.) The second reason was God wanted the clintons brought to justice for all their murders and zillions of other crimes! (This president Trump failed to do and almost went to prison in their place) God is calling him back to CLEAN UP WASHINGTON!!! To put reality and integrity BACK into the Justice department and credibility BACK into the fbi and cia make them the “good guys” not the evil beasts liars and murderers who have been breaking the law in these groups all over the world!"
D4tn6380FdM,"Jewish/Christian Bible
Revelation 21:8
“But the cowardly, unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice “magic arts”(drugs), the idolaters, AND….ALL LIARS!!! Shall have their place in the Eternal Lake of Fire.”  Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. So says JESUS.

So about FAKE news… here your propaganda and COMPLETE BIASED IS OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWING!!!!!!

First you pick out Elon Musk, a President Trump supporter and YOU say he is guilty of “thousands” of fake news posts, but like you accused canada of doing YOU DON’T GIVE EVIDENCE OR AN EXAMPLE OF EVEN A SINGLE ONE HE WROTE!

Tik Tok and zillions of others like cnn have massive endless fake news stories against President Trump! Even yours often gives a totally FALSE IMPRESSION by the way you take ONE line he says (OUT OF CONTEXT) and try to give a totally wrong impression often exact opposite of what he was actually saying when you hear it in context. THAT’s not journalism sweetheart THATS FRAUD AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS- which are as deadly and dangerous and harmful to a person as if you were shooting AT him with a gun or hitting him with a club!"
D4tn6380FdM,"Jewish/Christian Bible
“Thou shalt NOT kill!!!”

Hold on there sister Palki!!!!
You said “chameleon the call girl being IN FAVOR of ending the developing life in the womb” is her GREATEST STRENGTH!”

WRONG!!! Not a “strength” in ANY Religion in America or ANY GOD BELIEVER!! Or Jewish or Christian Bible Believer or even the false religions like the muslim or mormon faiths etc. 
ALL “DESPISE” ABORTIONS!!!

Even if you SAY abortion is not murder or is not STOPPING something Almighty God is creating you absolutely must agree that at least to say it is a separate living organism in the woman’s body therefore you are ending its ability to live. You are ending a type of “life”  living in the body.

This will not find favor with God or a growing informed public!
Back when this all started we did not have sonograms technology, but now people can actually SEE the BABY they are turning more and more against such a travesty and barbarism.
Leonardo DaVinci- the Famous Painter of the Mona Lisa, the man from Vinci painter scientist etc… he was friends with a man who performed autopsy’s so Leonardo saw a babe in the womb with his own eyes and did a drawing of it, looks a lot like our sonograms of today. That sort of event changes the minds of even the hardest hearts! “SEEING” IT FIRST HAND- What’s been done in reality not just empty “TALK”.

Ecclesiastes 11:5-6
“Just as you do not know where or how the LORD AND HIS LIGHT MAKES the wind blow or in what direction  and just like you don’t know how the LORD forms the bones of a baby in the womb, so TOO you DON’T know the will and mysterious WAYS AND WORKS OF GOD, you don’t have a clue about what HE is doing! Or how HE CREATES EVEYTHING!!!” HIS WAYS AND THOUGHTS ARE HIGHER THAN OURS AS MUCH AS THE UNIVERSE IS ABOVE THE EARTH!!!

When things don’t go as people wish or pray, they really ought to say…
“LORD, you must REALLY be up to something GOOD!!!” Because His LOVE AND GOODNESS AND MERCY AND COMPASSION AND WISDOM ARE INFINITE!!!"

D4tn6380FdM,"“ HYPOCRISY OF PALKI SHARMA “ 

It’s weird Palki constantly says American Republican VP nominee JD Vance can’t boost his Indian connection just because he’s married to an Indian woman but even though Kamala Harris herself has said time and time again that she is first American 🇺🇸 & second Jamaican American 🇺🇸 & nothing more full stop, Kamal Harris never acknowledges her Indian background publicly still yet Palki fondly talks about & favors Kamala just because of her maternal Indian background, isn’t that a bit hypocritical Palki 🙄… 

During the BLM & ANTIFA riots & anarchism that swept across America in summer of 2020 Tim Walz as a governor of Minnesota was defending criminals, rioters & anarchist instead of doing his mandated job of arresting & prosecuting them and Kamala Harris was collecting donations for bail money to get those criminals out of prison, if Harris & Walz gets elected the rest of America 🇺🇸 will go through similar situation of anarchism…

As a governor of Minnesota Tim Walz made unconstitutional laws that gave permission to illegal immigrants to apply for driving licenses which they eventually used those driving licenses to registered to vote in both local & federal elections…

As governor of Minnesota Tim Walz made absurd scary laws that gave parents, doctors & hospitals permission to perform permanent life altering gender changing medical procedures to innocent children as young as 6 to 12 years old boys & girls…

Tim Walz is a STOLEN VALOR aka fake army veteran, when the army unit of Tim Walz was ordered to be deployed in Iraq 🇮🇶 war his unit went to Iraq 🇮🇶 to fulfill their mission & duties but Tim Walz as the unit’s highest ranking officer of 5 thousand soldiers Tim Walz chickened out and refused to go to Iraq 🇮🇶 and left the army, his whole army unit still despises him for abandoning his army unit / brothers in arms, basically he’s a dishonorable disloyal traitor to his own country 🇺🇸. Under the stolen valor act of 2005 Tim Walz committed a federal crime to which he could be sentenced to 6 months in federal prison…

Well by now everyone knows about Tim Wlaz close ties to CCP China 🇨🇳, he spent years in Communist China 🇨🇳 as a so-called teacher but nobody actually knows till date what he was really doing there, his ties to Communist China 🇨🇳 was so great that he honeymooned there & even used to organize high level visits of Communist Chinese officials & their children / students to America 🇺🇸…

Marxism, Leninism & Socialism all leads to dreadful communism all of which has killed over 200 million innocent people globally, not long time ago socialism & communism was an absolute no no taboo ideology in America 🇺🇸 and anyone who is associated with socialism and communism would get a severe lengthy jail sentence but now the VP nominee Tim Walz himself is a self-declared SOCIALST, next the American Democrats will have a new comrade relations with socialist Russia 🇷🇺 & communist China 🇨🇳, talk about treason and being one with the enemies 🙄…

Unlike the Biden / Kamala administration’s confrontational & condescending attitude towards India 🇮🇳the Trump administration had a respectful & mutually beneficial attitude towards India 🇮🇳 & the bohemian realist relationship between President Trump & Prime Minister Modi has been acknowledged & witnessed by every Indian globally…

Now a days Palki is sounding more and more like American 🇺🇸 leftist politically biased mainstream media like CNN whose sole job is to work as PR for American Democrats political party hiding democrats failures & propagating negative rhetoric against American Republican Party, perhaps because both CNN-News18 & Firstpost News both are owned by Network18 Group…

Palki your prominence in news media rose
in defiance of the political biased and unethical mainstream media but now you are sounding and acting more like them, Palki remember your USP is giving out an unvarnished raw news without any sort of bias personal emotions and political sentiments, PERIOD…

“ 🇺🇸 VOTE~RIGHT~TO~BE~RIGHT 👍 “ 
                            - OR -

D4tn6380FdM,one correction ... 81 million voted through postal ballots is not true. my guess would be at least 80million would have been physical voting in the voting booths.
D4tn6380FdM,Too much news on US elections and Gaza war...... what is important is the winner and how  will it effect India.
D4tn6380FdM,"Palki is for Trump too, undercover"
D4tn6380FdM,"The ""real news"" said covid was natural, hunter's laptop was Russian disinformation, Trump was. Russian asset, and countless other straight lies. Stop pretending that X and Musk are misinformation. Even Musk can be community noted on X. Nobody is stopping you from lying. You say Trump is racist without any proof. Democrats say he wanted Liz Cheney murdered. Another lie. Is journalism dead?  X and online media are better than mainstream media."
D4tn6380FdM,"Democrats has the house and senate in 2020. Why didn't they pass abortion then? Kamala Harris is a fake, liar, puppet who works for corporations. She the only racist in the race.

D4tn6380FdM,When Kamala spoke 🤮🤮🤮🤮
D4tn6380FdM,"In the USA the only group that sways elections, not potentially but actually does sway, is the Mexicans, not Hispanic or Latinos who are very very different then us besides our languages of course. South Americans, they follow our lead and we have authority over them they want to live in our communities not the Gated communities of America but the working class communities. Mexicans are the the Majority in this group by FAR. No real Mexican, REAL MEXICAN, will ever vote Republican it would be delusional to think they give a rats about us and actually mean it. Republicans just like scoring political points with us but dump us and our needs, like a bad habit as soon as they elected in.  Dems at least spread the money out/ spread the support out to more people who need it, not just tax breaks so  the rich can buy more Yachts, Republicans sound great on paper and  in theory but do nothing for us ZERO. Facts! Trump said if they accidently deport a few citizens on accident during mass deportation, it wouldn't be the worst thing. Yeah the same stuff they been doing since the 70', 80's, 90's to Mexicans Mass Deportations but done quietly executed in the guise of new laws after Sep 11th when bush destroyed the towers and used it to abolish Immigration and Switched to ICE with the Patriot Acts to deport even easier. ICE is more harsh and more powerful of an agency then the Immigration (INS) agency that was in power prior. Cheech Marin sings a song Born In East LA, he gets deported on accident in music video. This problem has been glaring since then at a national level but always hidden from world or brushed under the rug but LEGAL CITIZENS we tossed out and laughed at. Dems and Republican's are both guilty of this.  Kamala will tackle the Source which isn't the illegals, its the ICE administration.  The ONLY Americans who are actually Losing jobs are lazy, dumb and entitled ones. (MAGA) That's why they mad, their entitlement and influence is dissolving right in front of their eyes.  We democrats know that so many fields go un picked, un harvested because Mexicans moved on from those jobs graduated to better ones and the new immigrants coming in cant cover the growth pace for these huge agriculture conglomerates who need to expand to keep up with other competitors. Blacks and White's always voted and had power but we the new kids on the voting block and we fresh votes to both parties and we brought our friends and family to the polls . And they know this and still we are down played but is OK. We have influence on the streets not just on the news and on capitol hill and on paper, like the current leaders do, believe that. We don't get mad we get even."

Would you gravitate to a pro immigration candidate and has no religious morals, but puts it all on science.  The law is her forte' and she advocates not following Federal law on abortion.  Or would you want a Oligarch running the country to reduce the deficit while funding the Military's budget to make up for Obama, Clinton, and Biden after the 911 attack.  Would you want a person using their presidential power to move their agenda. Is his agenda good or evil?

D4tn6380FdM,Please adjust your reporting and review for accuracy. Abortion is not a right and is not found in the U.S. Constitution or federal law. We have a constitutional republic where states rights and authority supersede federal authority. The federal government can only do whats outlined in the constitution and that authority is limited. Abortion legislation has been returned to the states where it should have been. Supreme Court judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg also agreed with this and she is pro abortion. So please stop reporting false information.
D4tn6380FdM,Time to outsource to India to EC
D4tn6380FdM,Madam Palkisharma is so refreshing watching

D4tn6380FdM,Casual mensions of medicare deprive the cost of healthcare in US the focus it deserves. Should pharmaceutical companies put caps on the cost of their products to be as in other countries outside US it could reduce the cost of healthcare in US by over 60%. This makes pharmaceutical companies look like the good guys. I cant imagine the devastation of people who get themselves in the position of standing across the counter of a pharmacy in US

D4tn6380FdM,Always on time from Sierra Leone 🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱
D4tn6380FdM,Why is no one talking about the cost of healthcare in the US? I expected it should be the focal point of this election. Obamacare is trash and theres no proposed alternative. Cost of medicine and medical services in US is so high it is astonishing. And of course the cost of housing.
D4tn6380FdM,Kindly be objective. The coverage has been very tilted. Our MSM is already sufficiently dishonest.

_ip1JwzzABc,"Can someone explain to me how it is possible that Trump ""won""? He had very small rallies with few people, supporters walking away, was the result of blue changed to red in the count? In other words, did Kamala win and Trump not? The result is really wrong, does not match what we have observed! The whole map is RED ?????"
_ip1JwzzABc,"I work near my city hall, people were walking in to vote everyday since since early voting began and the voters were still walking into city hall 7:30pm day of election. And im in a city with a majority of black voters no way they voted for the racist."

Every video title was clickbait, giving false hope to your audience. Every headline ""Harris Landslide to come"" ""Trump implodes again"". Cheerleading to the initiated won't win elections, it loses them. You were so wrong about where we were in the election. Other progressive channels were more subjective to reality. You were/are in such a bubble that you need a large dose of REALITY!"

_ip1JwzzABc,Watching this 2 days post election. Lol.  Everything everybody said was completely wrong.  Just goes to show how delusional and blind the left wing fanatics are.

_ip1JwzzABc,You guys have been saying this was a slam dunk easy win since January. Is this MSNBC here??
_ip1JwzzABc,"Yeah... This is what you get when you wish upon someone you dislike the worst possible things without having real 1st hand knowledge of what is true or false just a personal hate based opinion & wish retribution on that person while disregarding the possibility the are or could be in fact innocent of said crimes, Trump didn't just win the Election, he basically won the entire Country & if he will in quick secession turn the economy around, when he does that, he will essentially win those Blue States as well, when he took office the 1st time around the economy was starting to bounce back some, But it was his very different approach of using his Presidential powers that bounced back The US economy in record speed, This time around he will quadruple his efforts, Rinse Wash Repeat if it works then do much more of it, pretty simple concept, all these bogus cases are now being dropped, Georgia case is done, Garland publicly said the Jack Smith Cases are done, His 34 time convicted felon didn't last long, case currently in question due to the SCOTUS decision which should be completely dropped when sentencing takes place but if not, in an appeal would be completely tossed, Letitia James case against Trump & Judge Engoron's ultimate 500+ Million Dollar Judgement not only will it being reversed, but the appellate Judges mentioned potential sanctions to everyone involved in bringing the case including L James, Engoron & the Lawyers hired for that case, Eugene Carrol's case also under scrutiny of collusion with Democrat Party and NY Lawmakers for changing Laws to be able to bypass the Statute of Limitations on an impossible to prove Sexual Assault Allegation case & subsequent defamation case, Trump beat everyone attacking him, including death twice, & won the Majority of the America's support, if that isn't a sign, 

Gregory L. Garmin published an article on Nov 6th 2024 that should shine a light on some of these issues,
Here are his Thoughts on the Future of Politically Motivated Prosecutions

The Democratic Party and its politically motivated government prosecutors also need to reconsider their actions. If the election shows anything, it shows that the public does not like politically motivated prosecutions and impeachments.  The argument that Trump was a convicted felon backfired, as the public saw him as a victim of biased and politically motivated prosecutions brought in Democratic strongholds."
_ip1JwzzABc,"Your missing the point,this has been a strategic effort for conservative control for decades 
- Regan era laws allowed monopolization of tv, radio, newspapers.
- citizens united.
- Florida law requiring 60% voter approval.
- now foreign owned propaganda company (Fox) has crippled the minds of Americans.
- religion teaches faith disconnecting belief from logic. 
I’m happy to come in the show and talk about this."

_ip1JwzzABc,"The pundits and media are ""analyzing"" what Harris and the rest of the Democrats did wrong. They did nothing wrong. 45 gave permission to the racists and misogynists to come out of the closet. 

What once would have been said only in the privacy of their house or car, is now yelled in public. I'm Native American. My ancestors were in what is now North and South Carolina for many generations before the first European appeared. I have a definite southern accent. I have been called a ""welfare queen"" in stores by magas as I paid with a platinum card. I can't count how many times I have been told to go back to Mexico.

Joe, nice guys finish last it seems unless you want to use your waning power for something dramatic. For me I do not have a vote. I have been worrying for years. I saw much of it coming it was obvious. Hopefully Trump does not want to invade Canada. I bet he threatens NATO. Or just leaves. What a horrible place USA is about to become. People of USA you did it to yourselves. All these laws and you did not use them wisely. Or use them at all. Pathetic really. You let a con man and and a criminal make fools of you all. So I'm quitting reading or watching or thinking about you guys. I will not unsubscribe. I am going to focus on my daughter and myself. I will check out for a year or 2. Good luck.

_ip1JwzzABc,"Ben, I  watch you quite a bit.   It's been all through Trump's last term and even through Joe Biden's four years in the Whitehouse.   I'm living in the state of Oklahoma and have followed you closely all this year due to the great concern I have for our country.   
     Now, I  woke up physically  ill this morning and  with a feeling of despair in my guts that hasn't even slowed down yet.   Last night's travesty of an election still nerve shattering fresh in my mind, I  looked at  all the glum news on TV.  from the shock of  Trump's victory, to Kamala Harris's concession speech.  She  even mentioned that she suspected Russia played a part in her loss.  Well, it was Putin and his tech cronies who was responsible,  flat out.  Everyone knows it.  The next thing that's going to be the next big travesty is if we do nothing and let  Trump take office in January.   It should be relatively easy to prove that Putin ruined our election.  But we need  to motivate every Democrat in  Washington DC. and every Democratic judge  in the country.   You could bet your life that if somehow Kamala pulled out a victory last night, Trump would be working like the demon he is  to do everything in his power to keep Kamala Harris from becoming president.   We all should be doing the very same thing.   Could you honestly tell me that we're just going to go along with this like the last time Putin put Trump in power??  WHAT THE FREAKIN HELL IS WRONG WITH YA'ALL???  What happened last night cannot be accepted.   We won't have a country left.   Right now,  we're all in Putin's back pocket.  Can ya smell the farts yet?  
     If Trump lost last night, he""d be screaming bloody murder today that the election was tampered with.  He wouldn't concede and he would be demanding a recount in every state.  He would stand in the way of the vote being certified.  He would have the election so tied up in courts with Republican judges, he would be sure to get his way.  The Department of Justice did nothing to help things or keep Putin out of our election and that too was another travesty.   I've never seen anything like this in all my years.  In the 1970s and 80s, this would never be stood for.  You don't give the highest office in the world to a 43 times convicted fellon.  We cannot allow ourselves to just be so complacent about this.   Don't let Trump take office!!  Ya won't be able to get rid of him.   I do hope you are at the forefront of getting the word out.  The election has been compromised.   The sacred voice of the people is being squelched.  The election must not be certified.   Our vote has been stolen.   

     The Constitution still matters as the law of the land.  Don't let all the blood that was sacrificed for our nation be for nothing. 
We have some time yet until it's really too late."
_ip1JwzzABc,Recount!!? It's just a projection
_ip1JwzzABc,"Now that the Republicans have the power they wanted, the reason they kissed the ring, I'll be surprised if he makes it to January 20th. I foresee either impeachment or the 25th Amendment, or worse. They all know they can't trust him."

_ip1JwzzABc,"Good news folks, All three branches of Government are in republican hands. Big changes coming, Thank God."
_ip1JwzzABc,The Americans have never lived close to Russia and the cold war and you don't understand how close Trump is to men like Putin. That's why you are volnerable and a easy target for men like Trump! The US have now a long way to walk...
_ip1JwzzABc,"This is bigger than Drump, This was his family's true name. He is a shell of himself. 💙💙💙💙💙💙"
_ip1JwzzABc,I can't believe what's happend. Trump getting in shocks us . We have followed you from Scotland .every day. God help America .Worried for  the people of Ukrain too . Bless you all and your show . I'm greatful for all you do .Glad to hear your carrying on with your show
_ip1JwzzABc,"I am convinced Donald had Epstein killed, Ivana killed, is responsible for all the deaths in the mid east, partially responsible for the deaths in the Ukraine, and responsible for the deaths in Butler PA, while pulling off a staged assannation attempt.

_ip1JwzzABc,The truth of the matter is: I am a 68 year old woman with COPD on social security medicare and Medicaid who will lose all of them and die alone homeless without insurance.
_ip1JwzzABc,Thank you for being here for us….I’m feeling totally gutted!!
_ip1JwzzABc,"It was sad  but it is an eye opener for people who feel sad that they may not be seeing what the republicans are seeing that they believe in a criminal than  a lawyer. It is like a medicine. Medicine doesn't taste good but unless we drink the medicine, our curing takes longer time or may never cure. So accept the results and open up eyes to what republicans are seeing. So it is time for introspection and see how the country can make progress. So focus on progressing the country and the lives. Continue to do your work instead of wasting time in seeing the media or the messages on social media."
_ip1JwzzABc,I’m done with this nonsense; tired of pundits talking about trump and I’m tired of democrats inability to lead; this is the worse case scenario and frankly the fact that I have to deal about hearing about trump for another 4 years sickens me and a big reason is this show; its all you and any other media company talked about because of ratings; done with voting and done with this show unsubscribing now
_ip1JwzzABc,"I live in NYC and am devastated, Just want to thank Meidas touch and so many people who fought so hard and many, bravely. Thank you."

_ip1JwzzABc,"~66 million Harris+ 71 million trump?That's ~20 million fewer votes than in 2020 Election. So many new Registered voters
How is that possible?"
_ip1JwzzABc,It’s done. Turn off the lights. No one cares anymore. This country is full of just the wrong kind of people.  We did this to ourselves by not creating options.  All we had is a guy who goes to bed at 8pm and a woman with a bunch of different accents.
_ip1JwzzABc,💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 with you Ben ❤️
_ip1JwzzABc,The world is in trouble!!!. This manchild ( name i will not mention) that throws tantrums.   the only thing he has ever run is run America to ruins and now he will destroy what  had to been built up  by Biden from the ruins of his fraudlent time as president. And now he has  been given a big green light. You vote for the leader you deserve. Wow!!
_ip1JwzzABc,"Benny and his cronie justice matters show arey awful quite since lunatic Donny beat their infamous GIGGLER 😂one Douche bag in, one douche bag out 🖕💩💩💩"

_ip1JwzzABc,"I’m  from Australia 


What happens in your country will impact us down under.

I  have been watching your channel which is a great platform…(hoping other people will see n listen)

I feel for TRUMP  voter’s…I honestly 
They don’t know what they do!



I’m very upset"
_ip1JwzzABc,"My heart goes out to the honest decent Americans, I can't believe there were enough idiots to elect that  evil, disgusting, hateful excuse for a human being!!! There's no hope for the world, no hope for women, no hope for America, I'm devasted here in Wales UK."
_ip1JwzzABc,Fact is fact: the president of USA is the criminal! I’ m in the shock! Nothing is helped!
_ip1JwzzABc,"I can only hope he gets dragged off to jail.  JD will take the reins, we dead. One of the towns near me were fighting off drilling.  They put up hand painted signs: from gases to ashes, from dust to us.  That was 30 years ago I believe they did over come.😢"
_ip1JwzzABc,🌏
_ip1JwzzABc,"Republican rigging in these states, we all saw the crowd size differences, her's were huge and his were, what? Emergency powers to president Biden now"
_ip1JwzzABc,Hey guys this might be a sensitive subject but what do you plan on turning the channel into now? I was thinking maybe a movie reaction channel? Something to think about…
_ip1JwzzABc,"This election reveals the corrupted trump organization. 
Is this the secret Trump spoke of between him and his house speaker about the election? something is wrong with the results of the votes."
_ip1JwzzABc,"Trump won by a landslide. I have watched this channel spew garbage for a really long time and today is the day you have to admit that most people don’t believe your BS news. 

Say goodbye to your career, since trumps the only person you talk about lol"
_ip1JwzzABc,"Hi. As you know by now, Trump won. It’s horrendous!! Is it possible to launch an investigation with Musk and Russia?"
_ip1JwzzABc,I followed your show throughout this election and if so many Republicans were switching from Trump to Democrat why did he win I just don't get it.
_ip1JwzzABc,"😢 from Jamaica, I blame the justice system which allowed this psychopath to run despite his criminal history. This felon even voted for himself with no uproar. This is your last election, America is officially a monarchy with Trump as the royal family. So sad😎🏁"
_ip1JwzzABc,Yall got it all wrong! Dont quit your day job! Pensylvania came quick huhh?
_ip1JwzzABc,Where is media's touch today? He's done thank God but hey he made a lot of money with his bs
_ip1JwzzABc,"I know Kamala was the LEAST popular candidate in 2020, but given BOTH Trump's & Biden's corruption and advanced mental incompetence, I still can't believed people voted for the #InsaneKlown. 
Had the DNC not cheated Bernie Sanders out of the nomination in 2020, this mess would NEVER have happened."
_ip1JwzzABc,All your lies didn't work. 😂
_ip1JwzzABc,"Meidas bros. Please use your intelligence to send letter , call to Garland .
Do not conceed  There must be an investigation!  Or we Lose America! Call Merrick Garland  202 514 2000  with list above  or 202 353 1555  have your list above..
We have to!"
_ip1JwzzABc,The man that waved at fake crowds is gonna have more votes than Kamala? 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
_ip1JwzzABc,Trump won. Move on - there is work to be done keep democracy alive! Keep the faith!
_ip1JwzzABc,"It is still about races, white women didn't really come out for women's right. Within 37% voters are white women, Harris got 47% and Trump 52%.  The women’s rights were not the drawing point for white women. But women none married more than 60% voted Harris. Independent women are the one actually care about women’s rights!

White women still majority rely on husbands, not independent!

Conclusion, Harris lost because she is an Indian-black woman."
_ip1JwzzABc,Blessed day.  What a wonderful world.
_ip1JwzzABc,"This is hilarious. Nothing but Identity politics, 4 years of hubris, then last night, on election day, a  DJT sledgehammer to all your sacchrine superiority....three ingredients needed for liberal tears.

You stay on the ground ... your last disenchanted follower can turn out the lights after he leaves you wondering how you got it so wrong."
_ip1JwzzABc,Ha...ha...ha...You lose madass
_ip1JwzzABc,So deluded... Every single one...
_ip1JwzzABc,"We r devastated! Kamala should not concede until Jan 6..  why doesn’t Biden refuse to leave!!!  He can announce Kamala as president, after all presidents are now pardoned for any crimes as president.  If the republicans can steal so can the Dems!  Come on Dems in power, have guts to save America!!!"
_ip1JwzzABc,"All over now and sorry I couldn't find you last night, Ben!"
_ip1JwzzABc,You’re not happy because everyone sees the true Ben. You lied to everyone period.
_ip1JwzzABc,Did you give us a false sense of security?
_ip1JwzzABc,You’re acting like a whipped puppy Ben.
_ip1JwzzABc,A very dark day
_ip1JwzzABc,"Your not so cocky now you silly little man.  Trump was always going to win. Hes the greatest president America has ever had. All you have done over the last months is waste your time and ....play the clip, play the clip, play the clip..  WTF? Kamala was never going to win because America would never accept a black female president, bad enough obama slipped through the net. Ok you silly little man....lets hear your answer to my comment  if you have the balls to.  PLAY THE CLIP, PLAY THE CLIP  PLAY THE CLIP.. you dead beat."
_ip1JwzzABc,Finally common sense prevailed

_ip1JwzzABc,Unsubscribing let’s see if we can get to 2 million. This win is good for ur channel.
_ip1JwzzABc,To bad crying 😭 like a demorat
_ip1JwzzABc,"Stunned beyond belief of the people that voted for this criminal and more so for those that stayed home for whom the brave soldier fought for 107 days and nights!! When we don't fight, we don't deserve -- so next time before you complain racism, immigrant apathy, misogyny and white supremacy look at yourselves in the mirror. America lost a great presidency because it was a nonwhite and a woman! We proved we don't see qualification but the gender and race."
_ip1JwzzABc,TRUMP 2024! MAKE LIBERALS CRY AGAIN
_ip1JwzzABc,PLEASE FIX YOUR AUDIO! It’s annoying!
_ip1JwzzABc,Ben I'M SO EFFING SAD😢
_ip1JwzzABc,"UNSUBSCRIBING, dont want to have anything to do with americans EVER....they are considered....LAME"
_ip1JwzzABc,"I am an intuitive channel and I got a message that Elon Musk interfered in the election from his desk.  Papers were checked going in and out of the machine, but info was changed internally to favor the Republicans and no way for states to know.  For instance Ted Cruz and Josh Holley were losing, but all of a sudden they both won for the senate.  Also seemed worried about Iowa losing..then Iowa won by big numbers.  There is so much more.  I figured this out when so many votes went strangely  to the Republicans.  This was done by Putin in 2016 in Florida to change the win to Trump.  Please pass this on to Merrick Garland...please.  Just need to check this out.  I am feeling this was fraud..Elan can put stuff on the moon from his computer.  He is a brilliant con man."
_ip1JwzzABc,"WTF it’s like I been trying since last night for Meidas Touch to inform us and still  nothing, but old news from Tuesday night! I feel like Meidas (Ben) just left us hanging!  Ben!?"
_ip1JwzzABc,America has been a joke since 2016.... But now it's more like a joke by Art the Clown.
_ip1JwzzABc,How mny more votes did trfump get?
_ip1JwzzABc,Please check the swing states ballots. There are many dead people still on the ballots.  Republicans will fill the dead people's name on the ballots.  No one informs the voters department that a person died.
_ip1JwzzABc,Ben and medias touch madame president kamala harris suspects election fraud having her name and his switched in the voting totals. Something strange was going on with all the states totals and dt committed a fraudulent crime and needs to not be allowed to move forward and be disqualified and pit in prison for it and Jan 6th. Kamala is fighting back and with good reason for she's the true president and didn't cheat like dt and maga. Go get him kamala and fight back through legal means having him and Elon musk and other interferes for your our president and you won not him stop dts trying to commit fraud for your our president and he's a fraud and crook and felon and criminal that belongs in jail for this and Jan 6th

THIS IS ANOTHER BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!!"
_ip1JwzzABc,Harris was a joke. The American people saw through it. The greatest political comeback of all time.x
_ip1JwzzABc,Time for Biden and Harris to use the power the supreme Court just granted them and get rid of these criminals.... period
_ip1JwzzABc,How can half of Americans be so incredibly STUPID to re elect this inhuman being again! The world is appalled as well!!!! He is a CRIMINAL AND SHOULD BE IN PRISON!!!!!

_ip1JwzzABc,Kamala came close to winning with just 100 days of campaigning. With another 100 she would have mopped the floor with him.
_ip1JwzzABc,I wonder how many sat this one OUT or left the presidents blank...

_ip1JwzzABc,I wonder if they stole the ELECTION ?
e6Funs6yyEw,"Listen to all those clapping seals yelling “woooo” nonstop.

Their joy didn’t age well … 🤷🏻‍♂️"
e6Funs6yyEw,"Kamala's formula for winning like she did in Cali and everywhere else  was not doable this time around given the lack of time, even at five seconds per male to do 50 million it'll take to long"
e6Funs6yyEw,Landslide victory! This skit was a disappointment.
e6Funs6yyEw,For five million bucks Beyonce opened  for you kamala
e6Funs6yyEw,"Mannn, she is good for SNL. Did she apply for the job?"
e6Funs6yyEw,Oh the way this aged…

e6Funs6yyEw,🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
e6Funs6yyEw,I blew my way to the topala! What a cringy fecal fiesta that was!
e6Funs6yyEw,"To all the comments I see that are being arrogant, Kamala isn’t a sore loser, so don’t be a sore winner."
e6Funs6yyEw,"I like Kamala, she's a normal person but she didn't win. 
Luckily I'm not American 🤪"
e6Funs6yyEw,"LMAO YOU'RE FIRED KAMALA, BUH BYE!"
e6Funs6yyEw,So cringe
e6Funs6yyEw,Well this aged harder than Kamala 🍿
e6Funs6yyEw,I really hope I get to watch this in a few years after she’s ran again and won☺️
e6Funs6yyEw,All of the ignorant people voted for klamydia!  Only educated smart people voted for Trump!
e6Funs6yyEw,Phew we dodged a bullet with this one 😂
e6Funs6yyEw,Klamydia Harryass lost😂😅😂😂😂😂😂
e6Funs6yyEw,No more DRAMALA. TRUMPALA! Bye bye ANTISEMITE.
e6Funs6yyEw,Wow she really thought celebrities and snl were going to win this election.  I bet hearing all that applause made her feel like she was loved by all
e6Funs6yyEw,Tnis does not age well
e6Funs6yyEw,BYE FELICIA!
e6Funs6yyEw,SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE YOURE FIRED !
e6Funs6yyEw,gae
e6Funs6yyEw,"Ladies and gentlemen, you just witnessed a greatest political comeback in US history and maybe beyond. PRESIDENT TRUMP WON THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITH LANDSLIDE VICTORY. 
Wish everyone have a wonderful time with family members on upcoming Thanksgiving holidays and also *** MERRY CHRISTMAS ***  TO ALL."
e6Funs6yyEw,I'm in 2028... earth ending brought me here
e6Funs6yyEw,She is my winner <3 She is my president :-)
e6Funs6yyEw,Oh dear!
e6Funs6yyEw,"Saturday Night Live  is sad and pathetic today. 
I'm happy because if that disease would have won we would have been doomed. 
Hyena laughing"
e6Funs6yyEw,This was funny asl 😂
e6Funs6yyEw,This aged beautifully.
e6Funs6yyEw,VP very pretty haha
e6Funs6yyEw,Your body our choice!
e6Funs6yyEw,Snl is so stupid.    Trump baby.  He’s back!!!!
e6Funs6yyEw,WOMP WOMP
e6Funs6yyEw,"In a few months this is going to age very well when inflation and housing prices go up😂
Kamala 2028💙"
e6Funs6yyEw,Aged like milk. It only took 3 days.
e6Funs6yyEw,y'all lost
e6Funs6yyEw,You guys lost
e6Funs6yyEw,"KAMALA- WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE IN A DUPLEX WITH MY HORRIBLE ILLEGAL MIGRANT NEIGHBORS FROM HAITI ??? THEY HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST ME THANKS TO YOU LETTING THEM IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY HAVE VANDALIZED ME, CRASHED INTO MY GARAGE, BROKE IN TO MY PLACE, DID VOYEURISTIC BEHAVIOR BY SPYING ME THROUGH A WINDOW WHILE UNDRESSED, DISTURBED ME FOR 4 YEARS BY STOMPING ON MY CEILING WHILE I'M TRYING TO SLEEP OR HAVE PEACE AFTER A LONG HARD DAYS WORK MEANWHILE THE HUSBAND BEATS THE WIFE INFRONT OF THE TODDLER BECAUSE THAT IS ACCEPTABLE WITH HAITIANS. THEY ARE 5 OUT OF CONTROL, INTRUSIVE, DISRESPECTFUL  DIRTBALL HOARDERS."
e6Funs6yyEw,This definitely helped seal the deal! So happy she LOST!!!!
e6Funs6yyEw,Yeah I don’t know how this skit didn’t win the American people over….
e6Funs6yyEw,"Snl is liberal trash, TRUMP 2024"
e6Funs6yyEw,Wooooooooooooooooo POST ELECTION!!!!!
e6Funs6yyEw,"This was probably the only time she showed her authenticity. Had she just been this person during the campaign regardless of her shortcomings, she might have won. The other guy regardless of your sentiments was able to relate better to the average American. Displaying her foibles and not trying to manage them, would have translated better to the average American. The sky didn't fall. When it is all said and done, Americans go on with life."
e6Funs6yyEw,This makes me so sad watching after the election..
e6Funs6yyEw,I was enjoying this until the real kamala showed up
e6Funs6yyEw,Well.. SNL is still very relevant and has their hand on the pulse of America so I know this guy will never win
e6Funs6yyEw,Here after elections 😂 it's bad when everyone tells you how cringe you are and you still don't know it 😂 I love how the SNL crew constantly shows what side they're on and then when they realize they picked wrong they immediately act like they were always on the right side bet they won't have the real Trump as a guest or host even though it would probably be one of the best rated episodes maga😂
e6Funs6yyEw,Somehow this skit kinda became funny...🤔
e6Funs6yyEw,This is stupid and not funny even after that idiot liar lost.
e6Funs6yyEw,"Loved this so much, and at the same time saddened in that Kamala should be 47th President of The United States. We love you Kamala!!!💙💙💙"
e6Funs6yyEw,She put up a good fight. Just America is stupid as hell rn
e6Funs6yyEw,How long before Maya apologies for the best Kamala impersonation?
e6Funs6yyEw,Was funnier when they did this exact same skit with Trump.
e6Funs6yyEw,"Kamala Harris had 0 qualifications. No value, no skills at all.
Worst candidate ever."
e6Funs6yyEw,"SNL should let Trump host again, maybe it’ll calm him down"
e6Funs6yyEw,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!
e6Funs6yyEw,"Backfired gloriously... A self own for the ages.. They did all this and went on to lose in a landslide, losing all of the swing states, the popular vote, the Senate & most likely the House too. Trump also ended up breaking & creating records.. This was a big fat L for Kamala. End of her chapter perhaps. America escaped a close one..😌"
e6Funs6yyEw,Copied Trump on Jimmy Fallon sketch
e6Funs6yyEw,Why watch something only to cry about it. They're making fun of both of their dumb a$$. Shats funny as fuq if you ask me. Especially since she got her a$$ handed to her
e6Funs6yyEw,I'm dying watching this and I'm not a trump supporter. Never count your chickens before they're hatched 😂😂😂😂
e6Funs6yyEw,CNN provdes best comedy and entertainment. Its not a news channel.
e6Funs6yyEw,"holy shit, you did it, i didnt smiled even for once for over 8 min"
e6Funs6yyEw,The funny thing is that the woman impersonating her is probably more fit to be president than she is.
e6Funs6yyEw,That Tim Walz impersonator looks more like Tim Walz than Tim Walz does.
e6Funs6yyEw,Snl= snarky nellie losers
e6Funs6yyEw,Thank god kamalas career is over
e6Funs6yyEw,And this is precisely why she lost. 🤣😂
e6Funs6yyEw,Lmao that ending was great. She wanted Pennsylvania so badly but the Amish said no no no 😂😂😂😂😂
e6Funs6yyEw,I think 💭 4 years we’re gonna look back on this and think… that wouldn’t have been so bad after all!
e6Funs6yyEw,Dana Carvey is the best
e6Funs6yyEw,Maya did a better Kamala than Kamala
e6Funs6yyEw,"Well, that there’s some peak cringe"
e6Funs6yyEw,HAHAHAHAHA TRUMP IS YOUR PRESIDENT NOW HAHAHAHAHAHA
e6Funs6yyEw,"1:00 I’m sorry but I’m not getting the whole joke with everyone that’s in the background, that’s supposed to be trump supporters, why they’re so serious. Is that part of the joke? That Trump supporters are “all white and old” and “very serious”? You all do know that more Latinos and black people voted for Trump than in 2016 right? What am I talking about here? This is SNL, they lost the plot decades ago"
e6Funs6yyEw,"Ewwww, gross. 🤢 🤮"
e6Funs6yyEw,Man was this cringe! SNL has lost the plot. They definitely can’t read the room
e6Funs6yyEw,There are people in the world who find this funny?
e6Funs6yyEw,"I think even the actors knew, Kamala was a miserable choice to run for president. Her token-ness and usefulness were on display for years. She’s gonna be the biggest nothing ever to touch greatness."
e6Funs6yyEw,Thanks for the nice pick me up. It's good knowing that showing her as a regular person really helped her win.
e6Funs6yyEw,"So happy. Four years of her cackling gone.
Oh wait..how come no mention you had to pay your Hollywood elite to show up at your campaigns. Please bring the real Walze to your show...lots of laughs."
e6Funs6yyEw,Its funny how SNL loves making fun of trump but now SNL is target #1 since Trump is president ✅
e6Funs6yyEw,"Hasta la vista-la, Kamala!"
e6Funs6yyEw,Thank you for telling America who to vote for. Please do it every four years so we can see how you're just like average Americans.
e6Funs6yyEw,"This is why she lost.
NBC are legally required to give equal FREE time to both candidates.
Harris picked SNL; a TV show mostly watched by people who make +80k a year.
Trump picked Sunday Night Football; mostly watched by people who make under -40k a year.
Harris decided to spend her free 3 minutes telling a joke to people who already love her and were already going to vote for her.
Trump decided to spend his free 3 minutes in front of a US flag, and tell millions that he knows their lives suck and he would fix that... interrupted and unchallenged for 3 full minutes."
e6Funs6yyEw,"LOL Trump, Trump, Trump."
e6Funs6yyEw,🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
e6Funs6yyEw,Bye bye bye
e6Funs6yyEw,This aged wonderfully.
e6Funs6yyEw,I'm so glad she lost....BIGLY!!
e6Funs6yyEw,"This was actually the hardest interview Kamala ever did. 
   I'm so glad she's gone."
e6Funs6yyEw,How did I miss  John hosting?!? cancelled sub I guess.
e6Funs6yyEw,She lost - buh bye Cringala
e6Funs6yyEw,"I never said acting like someone is bad acting. But I'm sorry i don't want to watch the end of this video. ""Get me out of here."" comment section... make it stop."
e6Funs6yyEw,she’s an icon
e6Funs6yyEw,"I'm from PA and I happily, gleefully, joyfully voted for Trump. You're welcome, America."
e6Funs6yyEw,so instead of joe rogan she went to snl .......it looks like she got her priorities in check.
e6Funs6yyEw,"“Worth a shot” oof 
Freudian slip? 🥸"
e6Funs6yyEw,"this confirmed that she is simply an actress, no other legitimate candidate would have done this"
e6Funs6yyEw,So good!
e6Funs6yyEw,This was good!

Why is the American flag as upsetting to Demoncrats 
as is Holy water to vampires?  I know you're both evil, but..."
e6Funs6yyEw,Didn’t age very well…and I love it!!! ❤
e6Funs6yyEw,Kamala who ?
e6Funs6yyEw,"Media didn't really work, did it? We're so tired of your virtue signaling."
e6Funs6yyEw,"SNL didn't work, huh?"
e6Funs6yyEw,Funny now
e6Funs6yyEw,Well this was funny only after she lost!!! 😅
e6Funs6yyEw,America could have had such a wonderful thing going. They chose so wrong.
e6Funs6yyEw,Ahh pretending like Kamala is likeable. She ain't. Imagine everyone pretending they like you just because everyone lied about the other person being bad. The democrats deserved this loss. Look how their politicians are at the worst treated as goofy but loveable. They make fun of Biden now that he is out of the picture. But they still won't truly attack him.
e6Funs6yyEw,Love your bs
e6Funs6yyEw,So glad America saved itself from that. God is good! 🎉🎉🎉
e6Funs6yyEw,Kamala's belief in the promise of America is giving it away to anyone that isn't American.
e6Funs6yyEw,The bigotry on display here is pathetic.
e6Funs6yyEw,So fun!!
e6Funs6yyEw,"Watching this for first time after trump won is incredible ❤
Go MAGA 🔴"
e6Funs6yyEw,Me 😂
e6Funs6yyEw,This was powerfully unfunny before the election and now after it it's possibly one of the funniest sketches SNL have ever done.
e6Funs6yyEw,HFS you guys actually thought she had a chance to win? Yall are nuts.
e6Funs6yyEw,Bye Cackles…
e6Funs6yyEw,SNL once again out of touch with reality.
e6Funs6yyEw,Woooh! Yeaaahhhh! Ya lost sucker's!
e6Funs6yyEw,"The bittersweet feeling of seeing this so soon after the election...oof. But...hope is never wrong to have. It's still a powerful skit - cute and clever, and full of hope that we can come together eventually...instead of voting for someone who ostracizes other races and genders and nationalities and everything else..."
e6Funs6yyEw,"I think people from the US didn’t realize that the worst thing about voting for Trump would mean no more sketches with Maya Rudolph and Andy Samberg as Kamala and Doug… if they have considered that, the election result would have been different"
e6Funs6yyEw,06:03 - the shrieking liberals would have been enough to make you vote Trump
e6Funs6yyEw,MAGA !
e6Funs6yyEw,This aged like milk and its only been a week. I love it!!!! You show biz people are so out of touch!
e6Funs6yyEw,I was hoping it would be funny.
e6Funs6yyEw,Let's go Brandon!!  Yeehaw
e6Funs6yyEw,"it's a SHAME Karma LaHarris didn't spend more time attracting the voters she NEEDED, rather than whooping it up on S N & L to the voters she ALREADY HAD !!!!!"
e6Funs6yyEw,Anyone watch the captions? Rough interpretations of what was actually said.
e6Funs6yyEw,"This skit sums up Kamala's entire illegitimate 2024 campaign. She is an empty suit puppet of the deep state. SNL has never been funny, and the laugh track represents what the deep state thinks of you. They expect you to applaud like lemmings when the applause sign is lit, or they will manufacture laughs with a paid audience. Kamala is an empty vessel, and the only ""joke"" that they could even make was rhyming her name with stupid things. Thank God almighty she will be brushed into the dust bin of history with all the despots who came before her. Time to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Happy holidays lefties! FALA LA LALA LA LA LALA"
e6Funs6yyEw,Maya Rudolph lost her meal ticket
e6Funs6yyEw,rekt
e6Funs6yyEw,"With all of the celebrity support and mainstream media attention they gave her, against a man who should've been an EASY target (dark fucked-up pun fully intended), somehow she still managed to fail. It's fucking hilarious."
e6Funs6yyEw,"LIVE from America, she LOST!!"
e6Funs6yyEw,🚬🔥
e6Funs6yyEw,This is fucking legendary!
e6Funs6yyEw,I feel embarrassed for everyone involved in this production.
e6Funs6yyEw,Let me be perfectly honest with you all right now because I DON'T lie: I love Kamala Harris so much because she's a beautiful woman and is so honest and one of the best Presidential candidates the United States could ever dream or hope for! And please allow me to explain something else about myself: I am truly a pathological liar ! 
e6Funs6yyEw,"She should launch a cannabis line. With all that giggling, I could swear she was under its influence, as the nose candy makes you end up like Sleepy Joe."
e6Funs6yyEw,Well this aged phenomenala....
e6Funs6yyEw,✅ 🇺🇸TRUMP🇺🇸 💯
e6Funs6yyEw,I told myself I would come back and watch this propaganda after Trump won. Here I am. Anyone else??
e6Funs6yyEw,The passage of time is the passage of time passed because it already passed.
e6Funs6yyEw,The WHOLE planet voted for President Trump!!!
e6Funs6yyEw,I VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP A 3RD TIME!
e6Funs6yyEw,"i’m sorry but the way the US lost Kamala makes me so sad. such a tragedy this election. but not really since the majority of america chose it. you’ve made your bed, now you’ve gotta lay in it. i’m so sorry for the poor souls that supported miss harris. keep your head up 💙"
e6Funs6yyEw,MAGA!!!!😂
e6Funs6yyEw,This is already aging like a fine wine...
e6Funs6yyEw,Ok. Now its funny 😂
e6Funs6yyEw,SNL is so biased against Trump it's not even funny.
e6Funs6yyEw,"I can't lie, it's hard to watch this now. Dammit, America."
e6Funs6yyEw,crooked show.. sad
e6Funs6yyEw,"LMAO, get fucked SNL. This shit was whack. Bring back MadTV, they were always better."
e6Funs6yyEw,TRUMP 2024
e6Funs6yyEw,wah wah
e6Funs6yyEw,I never realized how unfunny snl became
e6Funs6yyEw,Knock knock.
e6Funs6yyEw,Thank GOD that robot lost to The Don!
e6Funs6yyEw,wait this is actually funny
e6Funs6yyEw,This video did not age well 😂
e6Funs6yyEw,Kamala definitely “opened doors”………to the United States so all of these criminal invaders can come in.
e6Funs6yyEw,Bye bye bye😂
e6Funs6yyEw,They supported her for being a mixed woman?
e6Funs6yyEw,"New York media got god smacked by The United States of America 🇺🇸 all 7 swing states are red, Florida is now SOLID RED, (thanks Kamala), and California blue is starting to show signs of cracking with Nevada & Az going red. COPE HARD"
e6Funs6yyEw,He swept ALL 7 swing STATES !! WINNING
e6Funs6yyEw,All that $ & $NL got smoked. Clowns 🤡
e6Funs6yyEw,"Qualquer coisa, a Mala Harris já tem emprego garantido. 😂😂😂"
e6Funs6yyEw,Hah hah. This didn't age well.
e6Funs6yyEw,"0:53 I love the idea that when Trump always says ""We're going to be looking into that"" he just means learning what the thing is 🤣"
e6Funs6yyEw,"dance party wit beyoncé🎶
beyoncé🎶
beyoncé🎶
beyoncé🎶"
e6Funs6yyEw,Winning!
e6Funs6yyEw,This will age well like a fine 1 billion $ bottle of wine 😂😂
e6Funs6yyEw,I don’t like Kamala
e6Funs6yyEw,Greatest L in history😂
e6Funs6yyEw,"I may bot agree with their politics, but I will say at least that these are good actors for the most part. And the cadence for Kamala was almost right on point, except the real one isnt even half as eloquent. Also, the actor didnt go through five different accents in an attempt to appeal to bases."
e6Funs6yyEw,"312 electoral votes won . . All seven battleground states . The Senate and closing in on the house . . Kamal Toe is 20 MILLION IN DEBT . . And somewhere there’s a liberal female ( ? ) sitting on the ground again wearing a hat , glasses and a green hoodie screaming . . . 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  ! !  I’m sooo sorry for my world . . 😅😅😅😅"
e6Funs6yyEw,Dana carvey does a perfect Joe Biden impression!!! 😂😂
e6Funs6yyEw,I’m here to see all the hard coping. 🤣🤣🤣
e6Funs6yyEw,I am so glad the liar lost. Maya looks way better than Kamala the liar
e6Funs6yyEw,"Hey, I just got back from Botswanala, who wonala??? I bet it was Donala."
e6Funs6yyEw,Woof
e6Funs6yyEw,"So out of touch, all of them. That's why they lost by a landslide."
e6Funs6yyEw,"Kamala is doneala. This video aged badala. SNL features pro-dem propagandala.

She's so fake-ala - irresponsala - she raked in a billion and ended with 20 million in debtala."
e6Funs6yyEw,"As a foreign SNL fan, one thing I've learned from watching the show is that America is not New York and I can totally see how many americans feel rejected while wathing skits like this"
e6Funs6yyEw,"Stop talking all of you, Kamala is talking. Lol 😅😅😅😅"
e6Funs6yyEw,By by la lal la . See you khamalala. . Off in the sunset you sail a la
e6Funs6yyEw,Feeling kinda stupid now SNL? Kamala is/was a train wreck.
e6Funs6yyEw,The election campaign was rigged from the startala.
e6Funs6yyEw,I will never forgive SNL for trying to get who they want elected.
e6Funs6yyEw,If only they made fun of Biden the same way
e6Funs6yyEw,"These two are part of"" ugly women for harris club""."
e6Funs6yyEw,We need Alec Baldwin back
IonVNbhEXGE,"Yo they aint never coming back to philly. Aint never coming back to ""visit"" the hood like when they do when they need votes. Thats all folks, theyll be back again in 2027 to buy our votes. They dont like us like they like their statuses, power, fame and money!"

IonVNbhEXGE,"🎉 Half the country is being CONNED by Trump. Project 2025 opens the doors to a religious dictatorship, eliminates civil rights, and allows control by billionaires and the president of all agencies. Eliminates the board of education, decreases food stamps, reduces Medicare, lowers minimum wages, and weakens worker protections, prevents peaceful protests. It opens the door to slavery. Encourages civil war in the U.S. Favors dictatorships. Save your civil rights to fight for your share of the digital dollar pie. Vote blue."

IonVNbhEXGE,"Let's unite to overcome Trump's divisive era today, November 5, 2024, driven by our shared love for America. It's time to break free from the toxic cycle of hatred & intolerance that has come to define 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' - a phenomenon where rational thinking gives way to blind disdain!"
IonVNbhEXGE,Trump only wants to “fix” the problems for his people not those in working class and lower.
IonVNbhEXGE,This woman is an embarrassment to USA!❤🇮🇹🇺🇸
IonVNbhEXGE,Trump won’t win it will be fixed votes

I can almost guarantee there isn't a single degree certificate between the lot of you! 🤡"
IonVNbhEXGE,"Same problem as the UK: no serious materialist left wing option or critique. 

Right of centre with progressive rhetoric (Harris) or far right (Trump) and lots ‘liberal’ guardian nonsense about lesser evils."
IonVNbhEXGE,"You see at her rivals it’s not just black people it’s also white people, but in trumps rivals it’s only white back, in the back ground."

IonVNbhEXGE,This is a left wing media channel yet almost all the comments are backing Trump. If Harris wins you know it's been a con and corrupted. I Think Trump should be leading by about 80% from what I see yet the media will have you believe he is trailing
IonVNbhEXGE,Donald Trump come on you  can win 🏅
IonVNbhEXGE,Trump 24 baby
IonVNbhEXGE,Can you imagine Harris meeting Putin? Disaster! More wars approaching if she gets in!

Let’s pray for Trump as the death tolls are just go higher and higher with her in office.."

IonVNbhEXGE,America be prepared to recieve your very first woman president
poz4VGcJHTc,"Phill, if you turned republican you go big!!!!! Millions more views"
poz4VGcJHTc,The sad thing is that most people on the left..including the mainstream media…would rather see US burn to the ashes than seeing Trump actually do good for the country.
poz4VGcJHTc,NO MORE FUCKING WARS LETS GOOO
poz4VGcJHTc,Worst defeat in multiple generations.  She lost every possible demographic you can imagine.  It shows how out of touch anyone that thought she even DESERVED this chance is out of touch. Its been fun thinking Phil was a voice of common sense for 15 uears but this exceptionally weird bias towards an obvious and undeserving loser makes this simply the last time I will be here. I truly hope he learns something
poz4VGcJHTc,MAGA BABY HELL YEAH
poz4VGcJHTc,Cope starts around 03:15:00
poz4VGcJHTc,Rolling my eyes at Ben. He came off as a Democratic operative and a conspiracy theorist.
poz4VGcJHTc,"This is what I've gathered in the last few months... culminating in the results of this election ...
Americans are broke and sick of the social crap.
All our money to Ukraine and other foreign countries wars. 
Cancel culture is deeply unpopular.
Dei is deeply unpopular. 
The extreme (not the normal ones!) Lgbtqia+ agenda is deeply unpopular. 
The divisive attitude of the left is deeply unpopular. 
The hate and horrible things the left says about the right...
All of these are the reasons why he won 
Not to mention, Kamala wasn't qualified, period.
We didn't elect him to be our boyfriend or our daddy. We are electing him to be our leader.
It's just that simple 
So many dems I know voted for him or didn't vote at all.
The left lost their base.
This win was a mandate. 
People can't even argue that he didn't win the popular vote cuz he did by a lot.
They can't blame racism because minorities voted strongly for him.
He broke records for voting blocks.
The voters have spoken loud and clear.
Instead of playing the blame game, it's now time for introspection. 
Ask yourself what your party did wrong and how you can change for the better. 
That's what needs to be done.
Otherwise just understand the fear mongering is outrageous and unnecessary. 
No rights are lost.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.
Try expanding your worldview and maybe listen to the other side and see you might be the one in the wrong.

Good luck 👍 
Everything's gonna be alright 😻

I hope my comment doesn't get deleted cuz I'm genuinely someone who wants us all to get along and work together. 
I have no malice in my heart ❤"
poz4VGcJHTc,"While listening to this as a replay I thought Phil sounded so much like my son-in-law in his phrasing, intonation, and idioms used. Even his laugh is similar. So I looked him up as to whether he spent any extended time in central FL growing up and it appears he did. The only difference is P is a much bigger potty mouth than my SIL who would never throw out any F-bombs. But it is crazy when I listen and don't watch because it's like my SIL is talking."
poz4VGcJHTc,I didn't pop my champagne bottle till I saw Defranco here almost cry ... haha.
poz4VGcJHTc,Trump: (Peeps head in) I'mmmm Baaaaack

poz4VGcJHTc,Didn't you say at the beginning it would take a long time to count all the votes?? What happened? That some states weren't even gonna have full numbers until next week?? I understand how the electoral college works but????? Weren't you warning us it would take a while???
poz4VGcJHTc,TRUMP 2024 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🦅
poz4VGcJHTc,haahahahhahahaha take some more Ozempic and go cry in the corner Phil

poz4VGcJHTc,"Enjoy your bubble bring popped again, and your echo chamber aired out, AGAIN. How does it feel to have every single one of us see directly through you despite the propaganda you cheerfully shoveled down our throats? Get f'd SXE Phil. The best part of this video is how damn quiet youve gotten after getting your reality check."
poz4VGcJHTc,TRUMP BABY
poz4VGcJHTc,The cope of the left is magnificent. Now they are comping with conspiracy theories how trump is become the dictator or how the election was rigged.
poz4VGcJHTc,The economy and identity politics are why your side lost.
poz4VGcJHTc,Yes Trump won.
poz4VGcJHTc,Let's go Trump fuck yeah
poz4VGcJHTc,So many crying people in the comments. Stop being so overly dramatic. He was already president for 4 years and things were just fine.
poz4VGcJHTc,Haven't seen Democrats this mad since we told them they can't have slaves anymore.
poz4VGcJHTc,Trump 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 2024

It also doesn’t help when the media and one party constantly demonizes the other party and calls them garbage… it kind of reminds me of Hillary calling them deplorables…"

poz4VGcJHTc,anyone have the time stamp of the exact moment it was called
poz4VGcJHTc,I am so glad Trump won!
poz4VGcJHTc,"Trump guy here. Let me help out a little you guys seem to be wondering why it is we vote for Don Juan. There’s 3 major reasons why myself and every other trump guy I know. Which is literally 95% of men I know. (I’m blue collar)   Immigration being completely out of control, the economy prices have doubled at least I don’t care what any MSNBC fruit cake says. I and everyone I know feel it in the wallet, finally but not least is all the performative morality (woke nonsense) no blue collar man cares about your pro nouns or wants some liberal arts major lecturing us about race, gender or sexual preferences we don’t care and nobody wants to hear it. Just lending my thoughts. I miss the democrats of the 90s and early 2000s hopefully you guys find your way back"

poz4VGcJHTc,I was watching Ludwig and Atrioc as well as your stream. Currently waiting for tonight’s PDS lol
poz4VGcJHTc,"4:59:25

Oh come on Phil. You can speak on this issue. The number of trans women skyrocketed during Trump's 2016 term. Did they get harmed due to legislation (sports does not count). No. You can be a trans individual freely in America, Canada, U.K. but don't complain or act surprised when you get reported to police when a man find out that you are a biological male. This won't happen likely but what is likely is getting harmed unfortunately. People overall do not like that idea and don't like getting lied too."

the US had to decide whats worse a criminal or a woman
they made a choice"

Anyway, I’m glad I didn’t even waste my time voting because I knew the baboon was gonna win. 🙄
What I REALLY can’t wait for, is for him to not do any of the shit that the maga people believe he’s gonna do. They all say how he’s magically gonna “make America great again.” Unfortunately fear mongering and lying your ass off wins out again guys. Well, every politician ever has lied their ass off to get them votes ahaha! But hey, look on the bright side, at least he can’t run for office again."

poz4VGcJHTc,"So now seeing the back lash from the left side of things, a few months ago Philly u we’re saying how the right was violent and non agreeable but now I’m seeing riots in Seattle bc of this election as well as the worst posts from my left friends on Facebook (literally wishing you dead if you voted for Trump) why was the right blamed for this violence this really shows how both sides are bad I wish the other side would get critiqued more :/ hopefully this show will go back to bipartisan bc some stuff said was ridiculous…"
poz4VGcJHTc,"5:53:40 Bruh stop. The invasion of Ukraine showed the world Russia is the textbook definition of a paper tiger. They're basically 1990 Iraq with nukes. Prior to that, they were seen as a conventional threat, not just nuclear. Now we know for sure they're garbage at conventional warfare and defending against them is very simple. It also showed drone warfare is going to change combat significantly from here on out in any conflict with peer and near-peer conflicts. Stuff your ego. This is just one election. The war in Ukraine has changed european and especially east euro politics in ways we can't even see yet."
poz4VGcJHTc,All that fear mongering you did didn’t age well did it?
poz4VGcJHTc,It’s not the fault of the media. It’s the fault of the Democratic Party fielding a candidate that wouldn’t win again.
poz4VGcJHTc,"We had trash candidates, honestly it didnt matter who won, America would have lost either way. 
At the end of the day, no president is going to solve Americas problems. Retribution starts and ends with the common citizen, so take care of each other out there, be good to your fellow man, and stop beiing a bystander."
poz4VGcJHTc,"For those who are genuinely confused about why your candidate lost, I can explain it to you if you ask me. No snark or scorn."
poz4VGcJHTc,I anticipate the part where we play out the plot of civil war when he inevitably refuses to leave office at the end of his term. May history prove me wrong 🤞
poz4VGcJHTc,i love liberal tears.
poz4VGcJHTc,I am so happy that Trump won!!! Cant wait for Philip Defranco show to get back to normal and not just propaganda

poz4VGcJHTc,"As you're so fond of saying about AI: ""This is the worst it's gonna be."" By which I mean, it's these next four years and then he can't be in power again, if he even lasts that long. And I promise that's not asking for violence, that's just recognising his age and health."
poz4VGcJHTc,Maybe Phil living in Georgia will flip him.
poz4VGcJHTc,Hahaha! Get rekt!
poz4VGcJHTc,Watching you “emotionally exhausted” butterflies just can’t handle reality. This was a vote against the last 12 years of Democratic rule

I cannot care anymore. I've gone absolutely numb. Any suffering, any heartache that happens from here on out is because of Republicans. They knew what they were voting for this time and there is no excuse anymore. 2016 - 2020 was just them fumbling around and fucking with everyone, taking pay checks and bribes as they went along with it. This time, they know what they want and who to go after. We, Palestine, and Ukraine are so, undeniably, unequivocally fucked."
poz4VGcJHTc,"😂😂😂😂😂
I love those salty tears!!!!!
Donald Trump maga country🇺🇲🦅🇺🇸 America first let's go 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇲"
poz4VGcJHTc,"5:23:30 - Phil talking about how Americans are sad, and tired, and scared, and uncertain. Ben - ANYWAYS UKRAINE.
Truly a perfect representation of how people who voted Trump felt with dems focus on foreign  issues"
poz4VGcJHTc,"Lolz.  ""Why does the right vote right despite their awful guy, we must go to the right too and attract disgruntled and independent votes.  Why do our lefties always vote Bernie in the primaries, we must subvert those Democrats or we won't be able to court the center right independents.""  DNClueless made it essential to write in Dr. Cornel West just like last time when we preferred Nader.  Bill Clinton sucked and the gerrymandered Mid-West ain't going all out with what it takes to overcome that for another neo-liberal third way Clintonite.  Abandoning the lefties in the tent for disgruntled and independent conservatives in the bush elected Bush and lesson not learned now elected Trump."
poz4VGcJHTc,Waiting for the comment section to shake its shoulders and release bullets lol
poz4VGcJHTc,The woke had lost

poz4VGcJHTc,We the people have voted. TRUMP2024
poz4VGcJHTc,They are coming out to vote... for Trump!
poz4VGcJHTc,Kind of made me laugh how much how quickly the strongly democrat news attacked Harris' campaign...😂
poz4VGcJHTc,The absolute satisfying deliciously butthurt reactions of the Democrats with the lame excuses now that its over is just comedic gold. And my country is gonna get sanctioned to shit with the Trump presidency. But to watch delusional people fall flat on their face and get a reality check is 🤌🤌🤌 😂😂😂
poz4VGcJHTc,"Blessed be the fruit, here comes Gilead"
poz4VGcJHTc,Hey wanna hear a joke? Kamala for president 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
poz4VGcJHTc,"I'll never forget how the Biden/Harris administration handled the pandemic. I'll never forget how people like Phil treated people like me who thought the left truly meant, ""my body, my choice."" I'll never forget how I was dehumanized and censored. I'll never forget how these people tried to gaslight me on things happening right before my eyes. Turns out, most of America is sick of the mess that came during Harris's time in office."
poz4VGcJHTc,You guys probably could have won if you kicked biden out sooner. Well maybe. Its my belief that Trump would have won either way..... especially after the attempt on his life.
poz4VGcJHTc,Why was everyone saying it's going to take days then we get a trump presidency before sunrise?
poz4VGcJHTc,Keep your joy...unburdened by what has been 🤡🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤡trumps back congrats all we did it.

poz4VGcJHTc,I really hope this pushes the UK to rejoin the EU. We can't rely on America anymore. I'm going to contact my local Labour MP to encourage this notion to the PM.

poz4VGcJHTc,"@TypicalMaia I saw a lot of nasty remarks being made towards you. I hope you are well. Your feelings are valid and I wish you are safe. There is uncertain times coming... it might sounds cliche to say, but take care of yourself. Find community and people around you to help look out for one another in these times <3"
poz4VGcJHTc,"Lmao, eat it, Phil. You and your Far-Left ideology is TOAST"
poz4VGcJHTc,I hope those who ’protest voted’ against Kamala are happy.
poz4VGcJHTc,How much more moronic can the US get? The rest of the world just shakes our heads. Incredible that you did this to yourselves yet again😢
poz4VGcJHTc,I wonder if the left will learn any lessons

poz4VGcJHTc,"IF YOU ARE A U.S. CITIZEN, apply for your passport NOW to avoid being detained during one of Trump's Mass Deportation raids.

Because an unlawful immigrant can be of ANY age and look like ANY other citizen or lawful immigrant, tourist, Foreign Student or Businessperson authorized to be in the U.S.  Since they are many more citizens than those without authorization, be prepared to be stopped, questioned and detained many times.    

Also, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has the authority to stop and request identification from anyone within 100 air-miles of any sea or land boundary at any time.  That means all of Florida, most cities on the East coast, West Coast, Gulf Coast and cities that border Canada - about 66% of the American population - can be questioned at any time and detained by if they do not provide proof that they are authorized to be in America.
Remember to make sure each family member (including minors) has a valid U.S. passport with them at ALL times.

Those who are Black should prepare themselves to be treated like how Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill, Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr and Blacks tend to be treated when interacting with law enforcement.

Immigrants who are now U.S. citizens should read the Project 2025 Plan on using criminal and civil denaturalization for revoking US citizenship to understand their risk.  

Those who are born in the U.S. and have a parent or grandparent who was an undocumented immigrant or granted amnesty in 1986 should read the Project 2025 Plan about ending birthright citizenship to understand their risk."

poz4VGcJHTc,"It’s was about money black men and Spanish voters. Also the fact that dems focused on trans rights rather than food on our tables. 

Definitely need to reform the Democratic Party. It will be more centralist sadly. For all our moral grandstanding it got us nothing. Especially when so many marginalized groups were ready to marginalized others."
poz4VGcJHTc,"Thanks for this video. I've been appreciating your channels consistant work for many years now. I am really grateful for it. This channel has provided me feelings of normalcy and stability that otherwise seem too rare.
Thank you. Thanks also for the entire workforces contributions, for yourselves, to have built a workplace and jobs is a wonderful thing and an absolute achievement.
Thanks for the feelings, and everything 😊 And be safe you crazy nice Americans!"
poz4VGcJHTc,It’s kinda hilarious watching this stream from the beginning the morning after the Trump win
poz4VGcJHTc,That's what you deserve Phil for spewing nonsense about trump for the last 6 months. TRUMP!!!!!
poz4VGcJHTc,"So, who won??"
poz4VGcJHTc,Watching him and his chat crumble was a joy
poz4VGcJHTc,"Democrats have to be the ________ Political Party known to Man!  All Biden, Harris, Schumer and Pelosi and their Liberal Media Pundits had to do was have their Progressive Members and Ideas put of hold for 2 Years!  If they had waited 2 Years they would have had Full Control of the Government for the Next 4 Years!

Instead they decided to Piss Down the Peoples Back and Insist the People got Wet because of a Trump Induced Hurricane!
Instead they decided to show the People what 4 Years of Democratic Policies Look like compared to 4 Years of Trump Polices!

Then they Expected the People to insist on 4 more Years of Democratic Policies and Politics!"
poz4VGcJHTc,Trump will enter with the economy going growing upwards meanwhile Obama and Biden had to deal with the downturn. Every fucking time a republican comes into office the economy drops we then elect the democrat. Things start to look up we shift to a Republican.
poz4VGcJHTc,I'm convinced that the people who make polls just make up random numbers and hope no one ever catches on.
poz4VGcJHTc,LET'S GOOO
poz4VGcJHTc,Harris lost the Muslim vote after  supporting THE GENOC1DE OF MY PEOPLE. Everyone that voted for her supports the dea_th of the innocent

poz4VGcJHTc,"Here for the liberal tears. TRUMP 2016, 2020, 2024!!!!! (...2028! 🤣)"
poz4VGcJHTc,"I can't believe the child who needs to be fact checked every time he speaks won... 

But I'm proud of how far and how much Harris got. It's nice to know that at least half of us as a nation disapproved of him. That's something"
poz4VGcJHTc,People are coping really hard in these comments. Y’all were not living in reality. This is what happens when you’re so open minded that your brain falls out.
poz4VGcJHTc,"5:44:50 did he really say there needs to be more unemployment to get a Democract President? That’s the learning lesson for you? That less people should have stable income and better lives just so you can identify as a winner of bipartisanship? Bro, cmon. The goal is for everyone to have a better life, not your ego."
poz4VGcJHTc,"Someone needs to fill me in. I'm Canadian, I have a hard time understanding why people support Trump. All I have ever seen him do is lie, deflect, attack, and whine. But Millions of people voted this guy in TWICE! Just what 'good' do people see in this selfish man?"
poz4VGcJHTc,Love watching this the people have spoken a complete republican majority with a republican supreme court!!
poz4VGcJHTc,Love to see the lib cope and tears😂
poz4VGcJHTc,The tears and salt from the comments are just amusing. I love it.
poz4VGcJHTc,We deserve this. Our country is that desparate to have a traitor in office. It should ne et have came to this. Out of two evils this was the worse choice.
poz4VGcJHTc,HA HA! 4 MORE YEARS YOU LEFTIST COMMIES!!!! YA.LL WERE TALKING ALLLLL THAT 💩 NOW LEAVE AND DO WHAT YALL SAID YALL WERE GOING TO DO IF TRUMP GETS ELECTED

poz4VGcJHTc,"I'm Canadian and feeling defeated. Not shocked but as much as I tried to not get my hopes up, I really hoped for Kamala. I hoped that common decency would triumph over the stupidity and selfishness of the American people. But that's too much to ask for"

poz4VGcJHTc,American get what they deserve
poz4VGcJHTc,fuck this country.
poz4VGcJHTc,How on earth did America let this happen?
poz4VGcJHTc,"Trump didn’t even do anything special it’s just the people who voted for Biden in 2020 didn’t vote for Harris this time,  it’s not as if Trump flipped so many of those voters. He got 74 million votes in 2020 and he’ll probably get a little bit close to that this time, Biden got 81 million votes in 2020 and at best Harris will probably end up with 69 million or somewhere around that.￼

The left failed this time tremendously to support their candidate compared to 2020, it’s not like Trump did anything to win extra voters"
poz4VGcJHTc,"The surrealness of the result has left me speechless. The road to this fresh Hell we find ourselves in laid by the gullible, (allegedly) well intentioned votes of the Right. 

And so Idiocracy begins, with it the suffering of people both in and out of the U.S. In Ukraine, Gaza and abroad, we have cemented ourselves in the mind of the greater world as a country governed by narrowminded, self centered conmen supported by gullible but well intentioned fools lead astray by their penchant for just wanting to believe. 

This has been the ultimate demonstration of how easy and profitable it can be to exploit the Right wing base - this is Trump closing the greatest -con- sale of his life. And in so doing, has painted the Right wing base in what is quite possibly the worst light in the history of U.S. politics. 

I can predict some of the responses: ""Cry more, lib"". I'm not a liberal. And there are no tears here. Just disgust and a sense of justice, morality and ethics that's seething."
poz4VGcJHTc,TRUMP 2025 ! ❤
poz4VGcJHTc,This government is going to have a lot to prove if they want to stay the way it is. I know that I'm personally disappointed but not surprised by this outcome. Countdown to midterm.

f-ilAJQv1DA,"Trump wins. Especially in the rusty areas of the swing states (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan) that were hit by the economic bomb, America First and tariffs should be used to develop American companies in steel, automobiles, semiconductors, and manufacturing (home appliances, parts). South Korea, the money machine, and China gave Biden a deficit of 1.3 trillion dollars. South Korea hid Samsung Electronics' 3.9 billion dollars in accounting fraud and recorded a surplus of over 200 billion dollars when it was Biden."

f-ilAJQv1DA,Being told you your parties candidate is going to be instead of that candidate being nominated and voted for is the single most anti-democratic thing I can think of….. and the dems so trump is after democracy.

f-ilAJQv1DA,"August 16, 2019, U.S. District Judge William Conley said to deny transgender people the ability to use Medicaid for transgender care violated Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act; the federal Medicaid Act; and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 

Despite this the Republican lawmakers here in Missouri passed a state law in 2023 which denies transgender Missourians the ability to use Medicaid for transgender care.

February 9, 2018 U.S. District Magistrate Noelle Collins said to deny transgender inmates the right to hormon therapy and gender affirming clothes violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

Despite this the Republican lawmakers here in Missouri attached an addition to the above law saying that no inmate in Missouri prisons shall be placed on hormone therapy and anyone that was already on it would have to stop. If a trans woman is removed from estrogen treatment that she already started she could get blood clots, she could have a stroke, and she could possibly die. Luckily the D.O.C. have ignored that.

Transgender Americans will be voting for Harris/Walz 🏳️‍⚧️"

oXkzSDXM5ho,"Dear US voters, please take a look at 
(1) what Trump promised eight years ago regarding migrants, regarding replacing Medicare with something much much better, draining the swamp, Making America Great Again 
and then a (2) how those issues look today _according to his own words_ , trash can and all. 
And then maybe, maybe consider wether you'd hire anybody again on that track record.

This decision is not about being Republican or Democratic; it’s about voting for freedom, against fascism and inequality. It’s a battle for women's rights, to combat poverty, and to ensure healthcare for all.

Let’s not allow our country, today and tomorrow, to sink into darkness. Let’s shine a light on our future: vote for Kamala Harris - Tim Walz!

These individuals have made public"
oXkzSDXM5ho,"Is voting a compliance test? Don't get me wrong. I like that trump is funny and appears to be competent at least and he's a man, but he's still just a liar and a puppet of whatever creepy parasite is actually running the show here. I'm wondering if they push the voting thing so hard to measure compliance to see how much further down the dystopian rabbit hole they can push us."
oXkzSDXM5ho,"Why would anybody with even half a brain vote for that tyrant? Donald Trump is a narcissist. He's nothing but a bully. People who endorse or praise Trump are ignorant of the facts.🤦‍♂️ The guy is a psychopath.

Trump is a convicted felon. He has 34 felony convictions. He's also a sexual predator. We all know he's a racist who promotes violence against others. That's the last thing we need more of in America. Trump is nothing but a bully! He will throw anyone under the bus who is of no use to him anymore.

Even with the best advisers, a president needs to understand how the government operates. But Trump is very ignorant and didn’t know what the nuclear triad was when asked in a debate. But yet, Trump describes himself as “a really smart person,” frequently mentioning his ivy league education. But he fails to mention, how he hired someone to take his SAT tests for him. That information was shared by his own niece, Mary Trump when she had an interview with George Stephanopoulos. https://youtu.be/rp_Ew98D4OM?si=V16CudKqcapxzraB

Trump's own niece declared an interview that Donald Trump is a psychopath and a danger to the American people. Considering that she's a licensed psychologist and one of his family members, she should know what she's talking about. 

Trump not only lies, but doubles down on those lies. He said that Muslims in New Jersey cheered 9/11, that vaccines cause autism, that Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. and that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by China to close U.S. factories.

Sometimes presidents have to support foreign leaders with whom they disagree. Trump, however, has openly praised Russia’s dictator Vladimir Putin, calling him “a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.” but the truth is, he is far from being respected. Putin is highly feared, having left a trail of dead journalists and invaded countries.

Trump is clearly a bigot. Not since the days of the confederacy have American leaders openly criticized another race or religion. Trump has called Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists, proposed registering all Muslims and said of an African-American protester, “Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.” 

The potential commander in chief is also a draft dodger. He missed his opportunity to serve. Trump wasn’t drafted because of “bone spurs” in his feet that have since miraculously vanished. American men who came of age during the Vietnam War know exactly what that means.

Trump isn't even a great businessman. His Atlantic City casino ventures went bankrupt four times. He’s wealthy now, but only because he inherited a lucrative family business and only achieved real success when he turned from real estate development to franchising his name for other developers’ projects.

Trump is also a poor example for children. A would-be President who insults women, spews profanity, is on his third wife, and calls anyone who disagrees with him a “loser” is NOT a president to look up to.

And did you know that Trump was found liable for battery and defamation by a federal jury in New York for raping writer E. Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s? The former disgraced president had claimed that” he never met her” and “she’s not my type.” During his deposition, Carroll’s lawyer asked Trump to identify the people in a photo. Trump pointed to Carroll and confused her with his second wife Marla Maples. At the time the rape occurred Carol was 100% “his type.”  And are you aware that he was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million in damages but will owe more since the day after the jury found him guilty he went on C.N.N. and defamed her all over again?

Donald Trump has already been found guilty of fraud in a civil case in New York brought by Attorney General Letitia James. Trump would inflate his assets to get higher terms on loans based on his property value. Trump, for example, told banks his apartment in Trump Tower was 30,000 square feet. The reality is his apartment is only 10,996 square feet. Then the tax cheat would deflate the value of his property to avoid paying higher taxes. 

Trump was also indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, for conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election, interrupt Congress and deprive Americans of their right to vote. Trump spread the big lie to make his supporters think the 2020 election was stolen. He summoned a crowd to the Ellipse and fired them up and told them to march to the Capital or they wouldn’t have a country. Five people died because of January 6 and 138 were injured, many severely.  Trump pleaded not guilty and faced up to 20 years in prison.

Trump was also charged by a federal grand jury in Florida for mishandling classified documents from his White House and obstructing the investigation into them. He allegedly shared a classified map with visitors and stored boxes of records in his Mar-a-Lago estate, including in a ballroom, bathroom, and shower. A billionaire, who belonged to the Mar-a-Lago club Trump owns, stated publicly that Trump shared our nuclear submarines capabilities with him.  Trump cannot be trusted with American secrets let alone the nuclear codes.

Trump was also indicted by a grand jury in Georgia for interfering with the 2020 election results in the state. He allegedly tried to pressure state officials to overturn Biden’s victory and used fake GOP electors to challenge the certification of the electoral votes. Four out of 19 of his co-defendants, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Scott Hall, and Kenneth Chesebro, have already pleaded guilty.

On Trump's social media platform, he sends threats to witnesses that might testify against him in his criminal cases. Trump knows his base is capable of violence and his hope is that his Trump supporters will carry out acts of violence to those who dare go against him. He also posts people’s information online to intimidate witnesses from testifying. People opposed to Trump receive death threats and need around the clock security.

Trump has promised to ban the use of federal money to label domestic speech as “misinformation."" This proposal raises concerns about freedom of speech and the ability to question the veracity of Trump’s statements. This way he cannot be held accountable for the misinformation he spreads. I guarantee that if elected he would limit democrats’ speech against him.

Another contentious aspect of Trump’s presidency was his administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their families. Although efforts have been made to reunite families, there are still children who remain separated today. 

It is a known fact that Donald Trump told over 30,000 lies during his four years as president. There isn’t a lie too big or too small for him to tell. 

Trump will also make sure that women do not have the right to choose what happens to their body. He has praised himself for appointing Supreme Court Justices that overturned Roe v. Wade.

If Donald Trump were to be elected again, democracy as we know it will be over. There will no longer be a peaceful transfer of power. We already know that every election he doesn’t win will be deemed rigged or stolen. 🤣 The guy is pathetic!"

Kamala Harris is the poster child for the greatest political example ever of Flipism. When you have nothing new from Biden to run on,  deflect attention to the other candidate.

oXkzSDXM5ho,Voting for Trump here in Michigan November 5th 🎉❤
oXkzSDXM5ho,trump's own advisors say he's unfit. It's a bizarre world where a drsft dodger who denigrates those who served is believed over multiple generals who dedicated their lives in the service of the country.
oXkzSDXM5ho,I honestly do not know anything about Harris. She never answered a straight question. Some of the time I really didn’t even know what she was talking about. Most of the other times all she did was blame Trump for things she obviously was being asked about politely by Some of the media. I’ve never seen anything like it.
oXkzSDXM5ho,RED WAVE COMING
oXkzSDXM5ho,"🇺🇸TRUMP2024🇺🇸
America has had enough of the Oligarchs and their puppets"
oXkzSDXM5ho,"Kamala Harris allowed the open borders so that an influx of illegal migrants could one day become voters for the democrats!  Unfortunately, she allowed sex trafficking, influx of fentanyl, gangs and terrorists, and 320,000 lost children.  As a Mexican woman who knows first hand the dangers of such reckless policies by this stupid woman, I am going to say anyone voting for Kamala are equally responsible!  How do you turn a blind eye to all the  pain and death she has deliberately caused, all for power???  What kind of people are you??? 
She doesn’t fight for women, or children!  She fights for power, at any cost!"
oXkzSDXM5ho,Voting blue makes America lose.
oXkzSDXM5ho,I honestly do not know anything about Harris. She never answered a straight question. Some of the time I really didn’t even know what she was talking about.

oXkzSDXM5ho,I'm not voting  for her
oXkzSDXM5ho,Democrats hate America. They are ashamed of our history and heritage. They do not deserve the freedom our way of life has given them. They think they can get it in some other way.

oXkzSDXM5ho,"Isn’t it funny you don’t see any comments talking about votes for Harris? All I been seeing and hearing is to vote Trump, yet the “polls” says she’s either leading or close to passing Our president Trump! They are going to commit fraud again and make Harris win…"
oXkzSDXM5ho,"To the people of Chicago who are angry about the uninvited guests, it was her policies that brought them to your city. Voting for Harris means you love having them chewing up resources meant for the citizens."
oXkzSDXM5ho,"America wants 4 more years of corruption, inflation, taxes, wars, and illegals!!  Harris 2024"
oXkzSDXM5ho,"And to those who say that Trump is calling border crossers ""criminals"" he is talking about those who are coming across illegally, they are criminals when the come over illegally! He is not talking about the migrant workers or the one who are going through the proper process to citizenship!"
oXkzSDXM5ho,I voted Trump and it seems like he has the edge this time.
oXkzSDXM5ho,Harris is a trojan horse anyone voting for the CIA/New World Order candidate is a traitor
oXkzSDXM5ho,Trump All Day!!! Flip red Chicago

oXkzSDXM5ho,"If border security is so important to Trump then why did he order his cronies to vote against the most robust border bill in recent history? (And you can’t say Ukraine aid, because literally the next weekend; Congress with strong bipartisan support passed a 95 billion USD aid package for Ukraine and Israel) 

He is a scammer and a fascist"

aC6X9fIKjSA,And something that bothers me y'all keep talking about the abortion all they did was turn it over to the states to decide what's more localized it works out better Florida state that don't allow abortions move to a different state than does that's not that big of a deal but when it's a nation policy it's not that easy to leave the whole country and I don't think abortion is up to the woman that's a living person in her body that she's hosting for 9 months that's also got a father why wouldn't he have a say so that's half his child in there
aC6X9fIKjSA,"Let me first by say why should American taxpayers give people 25,000 to buy a house they shouldn't and yes we need Mass deportation do you know what we could do for American citizens if we wasn't given all that money to illegals we was using it for veterans and people that really need help here that stuff is ridiculous what you're saying can anybody that was with Kamala Harris on that is very wrong"
aC6X9fIKjSA,Kamala not following the laws of the land her and biden make up their own laws own agenda instead of prioritizing Americans first
aC6X9fIKjSA,I saw on the news that trump isn’t gonna let anyone have abortion so like no women can’t get pregnant or else they will just be like try to get rid of that child which just isn’t right. He was also so racist about Hispanics…
aC6X9fIKjSA,"1 question what did she do as a vice president, 😱🤔🫣😃😆"
aC6X9fIKjSA,"The people have spoken and as usual the mainstream media got it WRONG again. Time for the media to self reflect...not the voters.
When you don't report FACTS....the American people will make you irrelevant. USA Today...you are one step closer to that. Time to fire some people in your organization and get back to journalistic integrity because clearly you're not there."
aC6X9fIKjSA,Well it’s a good thing she didn’t win. You would have had to be a certain skin color under Kamal Toe to get any help. Trump: a president for ALL of America
aC6X9fIKjSA,Kamala is crying along with all her Diddy celebrity friends who are fleeing the country before Trump indicts them all for human and child trafficking! Especially JLo and Oprah !
aC6X9fIKjSA,Thank you Jesus Trump won. Maybe America great again. Make America godly again
aC6X9fIKjSA,Let’s go Kamala Harris ❤❤❤you can do that
aC6X9fIKjSA,Why is there so much hatred towards women?
aC6X9fIKjSA,I'm going to be honest I hate both of them both of them are awful
aC6X9fIKjSA,Why do you keep helping unpaying taxpayers. Help your people! Trump 2024
aC6X9fIKjSA,Could you make it any more obvious that your all just against Trump?
aC6X9fIKjSA,Kamala votes are corrupt she is no where near as voted for compared to Trump but yet is neck and neck in votes which doesn't make sense. The voting machines are corrupt and broken and automatically converts Trump votes to Kamala votes it's out of control.
aC6X9fIKjSA,she aint pure blooded american why let her run
aC6X9fIKjSA,Kamala harris
aC6X9fIKjSA,Harris is a liar and will destroy this country and starve the middle class toll they die
aC6X9fIKjSA,"Trump he plans to lower inflation and I'm reality if you guys pay attention Kamala Harris is really going to ruin the economy with how she plans to do that, at least with Trump he knows how to do shit, you guys antagonize too much"
aC6X9fIKjSA,"Policies..Kamala Trumps a threat…President Trump, close the border..expand on those ideas and that’s their policies"
aC6X9fIKjSA,Don’t kid yourself. Save your country. Vote for Trump. From India
aC6X9fIKjSA,Wow another MSM shill. You all have lost credibility
aC6X9fIKjSA,"Trump: we need to do this, this and this to pull the country out of the pit it is in.
Cumala: duhhhhhh, Trump and his supporters are worse than Hitler!"
aC6X9fIKjSA,"The Democrat Party has become the party of big business, corrupted media, globalist control, wars, endless illegal crossings, corruption and lies. Kamala is the embodiment of the Democrat Party. If Kamala wins the US will be become a permanent one-party state and this will hurt all of us. Wake up people."

aC6X9fIKjSA,"Kamala X P.diddy 

Vote Trump 🔴🇺🇸"
aC6X9fIKjSA,"Just more partisan crap.  Have the candidates themselves state what their positions are, not someone who thinks they know."
aC6X9fIKjSA,Kamala put them here now she wants to get them out I don't believe that is LIES and taking the tax cuts away from the wealthy that will never happen those are her donors lies lies lies MAGA
aLCjnvTjYz0,That guy lied .    The only way Harris wins is if Trump forfeits
aLCjnvTjYz0,At least he’s not biased like cnn 🤣
aLCjnvTjYz0,Don't forget to mention those died 20 million voters difference which vote for Biden in 2020👌
aLCjnvTjYz0,I love how at the start shows that Kamala is winning when Trump had already won
aLCjnvTjYz0,"Here is how to get saved and be right with God, who loved us all, for eternal life!
1-Realize that all have sinned before God, in one way or another.
Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) 
10. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:""
11.""There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.""
12.""They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.""
23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

2-Realize that God loved us, even as sinners enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, as a free gift to whosoever accepts it.

Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB) 
8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.""
9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.""
12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”

3-Confess unto God to ask to be forgiven of your sins, by accepting this freely given gift of forgiveness.

1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)
1.""Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.”
3.""For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;”
4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”
10.""For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.""
13.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.""And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:""
28.""So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

(An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.)
“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.
 I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. 
I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. 
I trust in him alone to save me. 
Nothing else. 
Not my good works or anything else. 
Only Jesus. 
I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”"
aLCjnvTjYz0,After the 4th year vote Robert F Kennedy.
aLCjnvTjYz0,Shame.
aLCjnvTjYz0,This dude is an idiot. I like how he has no jacket and rolls up his sleeves.

And everything they claim hes going to do they do. Biden just gave our military permission to shoot citizens for protesting buden did that not trump he didnt even do it when cities were being burned. Also, ask yourself this. When that poor black women was shot in her kitchen in the face, no riots hmm 🤔. But when trump was in office, this shit was on the news everyday ask yourself why? Onley so clled educated white women who have never watched s interview in their lives apparently are dumb and blind kamala dont even try to answer questions she wouldn't go on rogan because she wanted him to come to her and onley one hour and gave him a list of questions that he couldn't ask hmm why?"

lCwCt7m0jpI,"Young men are going to vote on election day, they spent the last 4 years being told we have to vote on election date. I have faith, only way Harris wins is if she is the first person to break 100 million votes."

lCwCt7m0jpI,Men have shit to do keeping society going and it's more honorable just going day of. NO!! GO!! Do you want a trick or a treat?
lCwCt7m0jpI,"Maybe the problem is that it takes long to vote? I am in Europe and when i had to vote for president or parliament it took me 30 mins max between exiting the house and coming back. The whole voting process (id, getting ballot, marking and throwing it into a box) was like 5 mins. If i had to drive for an hour and then wait in line for 2 hours, i don't know how often i would have voted then."
lCwCt7m0jpI,"They playing video games & watching p0rn & anime. No time to vote, when the COD ‘athletes’ got a tournament going on. Can’t do nothing, just play video games"

lCwCt7m0jpI,"Trump should sue every entity that has blatantly slandered and defamed him with outright lies. Yes, the standard is higher for a public figure, but many of these statements have been verifiably false and does with malicious intentions."
lCwCt7m0jpI,He wanted to cancel CBS's license not arrest them.  No one said that. Thats a lie. So should Kamala sue Fox News for editing Trump's Bronx barbershop interview? There is a ton of footage missing from the original and that a fact.
lCwCt7m0jpI,CBS needs to lose their  broadcasting license. This is election interference 100%. 🇺🇸🤨
lCwCt7m0jpI,In all honesty the original interview was done very well. He was asking really good questions. The station had to save her.

lCwCt7m0jpI,You need to tell all your viewers (as do every other far reaching channel) to not fall for it. They want us to believe Trump is about to win in a landslide so that voters dont go out and vote. EVERYONE needs to have tunnel vision and vote regardless of what early voting polls are saying.
lCwCt7m0jpI,I mean I'd assume it's due to the fact there's a higher percentage of women who have more free time SAHMs and such. Hoping it's just the men are waiting for that day off
lCwCt7m0jpI,I've said it before and I'll say it again...   I believe that american citizens will vote for Trump in a landslide.  But i believe that Harris will be the next president.
lCwCt7m0jpI,Go Trump
lCwCt7m0jpI,"“We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.” Joe Biden

FACT CHECK: The posts falsely ask if the video shows the Democratic presidential candidate “admit(ting) to voter fraud.” It was a slip of the tongue - Biden was describing the voter protection program his campaign has launched in anticipation of potential legal fights over the outcome of the Nov. 3 election against President Donald Trump. 

Really? He is a mentally stable person and says what he means. He is not a dementia patient who should be in an old folks home, not the White House!!!!!"

Obviously this lawsuit is meant to bring attention to the unedited interview and he knows it won't go anywhere, so they decided to go as descriptive as possible. 😂"
lCwCt7m0jpI,"Unfortunately, when up against evil, like Democrats, we tend to let go of our principles.

lCwCt7m0jpI,Put ‘em out of bizness!!!
lCwCt7m0jpI,"Phil saying that our society has ""lost the presumption of innocence"" is completely wrong. It would be nice to have that in society, but we've never had that. Ever. The presumption of innocence is a legal concept and not something the general population has ever truly embraced unfortunately. Not even a century ago juries would send guys to execution just because of how they looked, nevermind any actual evidence presented in a case. Humans have not changed at all, it's just more glaringly obvious in an age where all of the facts of something are clearly available. At least in the past, that kind of information was limited. Now it is available and selectively ignored. THAT is worse, and to Phil's credit poses a problem that is similar but not what he stated."
lCwCt7m0jpI,Does he actually have a chance at winning this? It would be great
lCwCt7m0jpI,My vote is going to cancel Arnold's

lCwCt7m0jpI,Tim Pool spreading more Russian lies
lCwCt7m0jpI,"BTW, tim, if Kamala does win, make sure you don't blame ALL women, wink wink. Because, I love you, but you also have a couple of times acted like it was every woman in New York's fault that Democrats have been running the city and that they're getting punched, ETC. My argument is that I'm sure not every woman in New York voted Democrat. So, if she wins, this time do not think that all of the Women in America are as stupid as those devouring women are. and I do Call them ""devouring women"" because they do devour the very life essence out of those around them, especially their children and husbands and families. It's like those weird creatures in the dark crystal that suck people's energy out there brains and souls. It's a true bastardization of use the instinct that God gave us as women to be able to protect those that are in our care. Shame on women. Shame on us."
lCwCt7m0jpI,The best part of this is the amount. Imagine the news media reporting this as a ridiculous  amount. Then they have to explain why. THEN imagine the search meteics for the report and those folks finding both versions. Yeesh..
lCwCt7m0jpI,Very good point about the fact check
lCwCt7m0jpI,I think most younger guys are going to vote on nov. 5th. I know multiple guys that arent doing early voting.
lCwCt7m0jpI,Men tend to go on election day
lCwCt7m0jpI,CBS News is trash.
lCwCt7m0jpI,Hope he wins. You don’t hate the corporate press enough
lCwCt7m0jpI,"10billion!!! About time they got taken to task over their lies. If he wins, all of the MSM who’ve done this for year might start pulling their bigotry in."
lCwCt7m0jpI,Because it was a debate. The opponent does the fact-checking. 5:26
lCwCt7m0jpI,Dang Harris lacks strength.
lCwCt7m0jpI,Men let's go!!! This is your opportunity to save the world!!! ❤️❤️
lCwCt7m0jpI,We love ❤ you trump

lCwCt7m0jpI,"I love that Trump did this suit! At the very least, Trump will get a transcript of the entire interview as a part of discovery... and, Trump has every legal right to release it!~"
lCwCt7m0jpI,11:46 no they’re not voting because people are smart to the fact that your vote doesn’t count if you think that your vote counts nowadays you’re fucking fucking idiot 11:58
lCwCt7m0jpI,The only reason they went after Epstein was because they’re hoping he would have something on Trump to get rid of him.  The only reason they went after P Diddy so that they can blackmail officials and CEOs and investors so they could rig the election information is worth more than money

lCwCt7m0jpI,Why can't he sue Kamala for saying project 2025 is HIS? She has said it numerous times.
lCwCt7m0jpI,"They story JD Vance told about his kid cursing in pubic makes him more relatable, especially with parents, because every parent has been in that situation at one time or another."
lCwCt7m0jpI,"I think the BIGGEST problem with people actually going out to vote, is that they were disillusioned by the last election because it was so obviously fake.  Most men I know, think they cheated, and most of those men also think, since very little is being done about the cheating, and there are 20+ million new voters in the country, that there's not any point in it.  I don't know about ""most"" men, but I know of my idiot friend group, that's a pretty common opinion.   

I don't exactly disagree, except I DO disagree that it's pointless - there's absolutely a point in it - but there is no point if you don't all get off your asses and vote.  There's a lot more in our favor this time than ever before - I'd like to think the men in this country were a little smarter than that - but sometimes I wonder, when I still see people watching sportsball and going out of their way to avoid any and all political discussion - like my current boss - it's pathetic to see how uninterested he is in his future, and it's almost like he thinks it'll all be the same no matter what - at the same time, I've gotten him to acknowledge just how much worse things got after Joe was installed.  

Apathy because of all the bullshit, IS a problem and I DO understand it - but it's also suicidal."
lCwCt7m0jpI,This is the only way to make them change...  Bankrupt them
lCwCt7m0jpI,Can't wait for the $10 Billion Lebron James lawsuit for defamation.😊

lCwCt7m0jpI,Jd Vance is not normal.he is a deep state plant
lCwCt7m0jpI,CBS did it. We ALL saw it.  WH needs same with editing of Biden's remarks ALL of the time.
lCwCt7m0jpI,As a women and an early voter this election I proudly voted Trump. I did however see alot of Boomers over young ppl when i did which is also worrisome for the election.

lCwCt7m0jpI,"CBS should be prosecuted for propagandizing the American people. Along with every other propaganda outlet. This crap is out of control. Since communist in Chief Obama, there has been nothing but propaganda 24/7 from the democrat media. How could anyone want to live in a world of propaganda and lies?????  What is it with the left and their loathing of everything that’s good and true??  If they want to remain children in a protected bubble, then fine. But, it’s unfair to cause real world harm and destruction with their fiction. Unfair and evil"

I’m listening
I’m going to go out and vote for TRUMP. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
lCwCt7m0jpI,"I think that by law, all political candidate interviews should be available in full, with no cuts, for free.  No paywalls.  There can be edited versions, but the unedited version has to be available, and the instructions to get to the unedited version must be directly under the edited interview on TV, and in the description when shown online."

lCwCt7m0jpI,Kamala Harris favorite food is apple sauce
lCwCt7m0jpI,It is election interference. They've been interfering in elections heavy since 2020. I know its been longer but I'm just going to talk about what's gone on more recently. They've also decimated Trumps character with propaganda and straight up lies. Saying that Trump said someone should be arrested in and of itself is contributing to the decimation of trumps character. people call Trump a rapist. That proves it right there his character is decimated. They didnt replace it according to JD Vance. They shortened the answer bigtime which is the same thing. Just keeping it in context.
lCwCt7m0jpI,"Men you must vote now,  You give power of vote to women. Now it is time vote"

lCwCt7m0jpI,"Nice that he's suing them but please, men, go vote."
lCwCt7m0jpI,Voting is gross
lCwCt7m0jpI,This is likely why Kamala Harris would never experience Joe Rogan’s podcast.
lCwCt7m0jpI,"4:18 ""We do this to _many_ interviews...""

*Dr. Evil Trump* 🤙: ""then they should be sued for.... *ONE.... **_HUNDRED_** BILLION Dollars!*"
lCwCt7m0jpI,The plan is to blame him for using the national guard on the riots after he is elected. He will win
lCwCt7m0jpI,He should sue google for 10 TRILLION
lCwCt7m0jpI,"If they claim they do it for everyone, they would have to prove that, destroying themselves."
lCwCt7m0jpI,The left are do caught up in Kamala they are to blind to see their candidate is pull the wool over their eyes just like Biden did By not taking the hard important questions and fact checking her is actually treating those she claims she is representing in the country is pulling a von job on them. Plus in return those people she represents should want the hard questions and facts to be checked to get to the truth of what kind of person she is. She was handed the nomination she did not earn it by debating others in her party that are qualified to run for president. By nominating her without going against others in her part is a slap in the face by the DNC other candidates plus to the American voter. Another words her nomination was rigged just like Hillary when the basically kicked out Sanders when she won and they got caught at it. And one person got fired and still holds a seat in Congress she should have been banned for life in politics because of what she did. It actually makes me sad to see all those millions of voters being screwed over especially those that would have liked to have a chance to vote for someone else besides Kamala. They had no choice their freedom to choose who they wanted was kicked to the curb unfortunately they are to blind to see it. It's just disheartening to see them used by politicians to stay in power. Whatever you may say about Trump at least he is no afraid or have to only get soft questions and he has taken interviews from people from people who hate him. It's just not fare for Kamala and the DNC to do that to the people who elect them. Just because I do not agree with the democrats policies. Heck I don't agree on many of the Republicans policies. But I do respect them enough that the held debate and gave the people a choice. To choose the best candidate they believe will get the job done. The democrat voters got screwed of the chance to pick who they wanted. Kamala had to drop out because she was dead last in the debates in 2019. It makes no sense they would have picked her to be the VP they had several to choose from just from the debates who held on to the end. Plus there is many democrats way more suitable to do the job than Kamala. Well the republican party is no better look what they did to Dr Ron Paul a few years ago the screwed him and they knew it. He could have won easily but the blackballed him. I think the only reason Trump got on the ballot in 2016 was because he had the money to back himself. Because he was and is a threat to the establishment in the Republican party as well. And what the democrats pulled in on RFK JR was underhanded. His dad and Uncle took a bullet for the country and the democratic party. I know our government was behind taking them out. I could go on for days on that one. But people need to stop by being dazzled by fake politicians or we won't even have a country. Trump has done far more for the people than many give him credit for. Is he perfect no. But he is far better than who else we have to vote for.
lCwCt7m0jpI,"if Kamala wins. Those young men won't be home for long cause they're gonna go to war world war three, baby"
lCwCt7m0jpI,"If Kamala wins, it means Democratic machine can elect anyone."
lCwCt7m0jpI,You never think fraud is the reason for Kamala winning? You sure have a lot of trust in gov when it’s corrupt everywhere
lCwCt7m0jpI,I hope he's succeeded in for election interference because all they do is lie and they do it to manipulate uninformed people who refuse information from anywhere else.

lCwCt7m0jpI,Elon should buy CNN next. Balance things out.
lCwCt7m0jpI,This could scare other fake news outlets
lCwCt7m0jpI,I would argue women dominate early voting historically because their men are working during the day and while they are managing the home they can go vote in middle of day much easier at least in traditional relationships.
lCwCt7m0jpI,Lawfare was a dumb idea.

lCwCt7m0jpI,I've been searching everywhere left right and Center for people taking the average person's pulse of how they voted in the previous election and as to how they're going to vote this time... I'm not hearing anybody switching from the Republican previously voting or independent to the Democratic side. All Street interviews n polling everywhere I see the exact opposite: that Democrats and independents are switching to voting for Trump. So in my honest opinion any other results is rigged...
lCwCt7m0jpI,I ain't going to war. Idgaf. Take the women. I already voted.

FsvJzfXZI18,"Forget the ear, the shot never went near him, it was never meant to. The shots were fired into the clear area behind him, (except in panic or rush the shooter hit some poor chap in the stands). The blood was from a blood pack he slapped onto his ear as he went down. It's was all faked to make him, 'blessed by god', the invulnerable survivor, the fighter. All faked."

I think it may have passed before he turned his head and you hear it after he turns his head. This creates the illusion that he was grazed. I think DJT has a bullet in his brain.

Then why is there not even a scar??? You shot half the dummy's ear off, but a similar shot on Trump doesn't leave a scratch? Even Joe Rogan didn't see anything when he specifically asked lol. 

This is the equivalent of flat-earthers conducting experiments that prove themselves wrong, then not accepting the results or moving the goal posts 🤡  

Trump for Prison 2024 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

*maga tears below 👇"
FsvJzfXZI18,Donald Trump's bodyguards are members of the security dynasty of Presidents Kennedy and Lincoln. This is a joke from a Russian comedy show😀
FsvJzfXZI18,You have to admit how ironic it is that Trump just happened to turn his head at just the right moment. Hand of God? Providence?
FsvJzfXZI18,God is Trump said ❤
FsvJzfXZI18,"So odd question: Would the shape of your ear affect the damage done by a bullet? My ears stick out more than average (I was called a wingnut in BMT), so I wondered if I'd be missing more of my ear in comparison to the dummy."
FsvJzfXZI18,"Eh, reality is always boring.  I'll tell the fun story."
FsvJzfXZI18,And yet his hear is healed without a scratch 🤔
FsvJzfXZI18,Point made. The ballistic head ear was annihilated.
FsvJzfXZI18,"That fact that he has no swelling scabbing or anything. And he won't let anyone get a close-up shot, let alone let people see his medical records of that day, says a lot!! I got bit by a dog 14 years ago  getting him in the tub, and it's still collyflowered.. Until I see his ear close up. I'm not sure about it all..💙💙"
FsvJzfXZI18,Anyone who has even held a gun in their lives would know that this wasn’t staged.
FsvJzfXZI18,Old vid but the way they are cherry picking frames from the shot on x is insane
FsvJzfXZI18,"Get this video hot again, they're trying to get Trump DQ'd by saying it was staged... again."
FsvJzfXZI18,He didn't hit the glasses. What looks like a bullet hole is in fact the plastic nose support thing for your glasses.
FsvJzfXZI18,This Guy didn’t deserve to die I know people hate him but if he had died. This would have been a disaster it’s just disgusting how really works with People expecting him to die but he lived for a reason and thank God He’s alive. Because I would never wish this on my worst enemy and there’s a saying let Bygones be Bygones and May Mankind live.
FsvJzfXZI18,But now it looks like his ear was never hit??
FsvJzfXZI18,WAIT...HARRIS HAS THE CHANCE OF BEING SHOT😱😭
FsvJzfXZI18,"would Mr President have expereinced the ""Ballisic crack"" of the sound barrier being broken when the projectile passed through his ear?
Asking for a friend."
FsvJzfXZI18,The only thing I’m concerned about is how is this man not get demonetized
FsvJzfXZI18,Holy shit the amout of brainrot in the comments is wild. Love how now the left is believing in conspiracy theories. You are either dumb or refuse to accept facts if you think this was staged.
FsvJzfXZI18,"I want to know how Corey got shot if he was so far away from Trump? It isn't like he was 2 feet away. He was pretty far away. I couldn't even imagine if the gun kicked he would have shot that far off, could he?"
FsvJzfXZI18,Dan Bongino says he is a Coward
FsvJzfXZI18,"That Trump shooting was exactly how it happened in the 2010 movie Machete.
It scary how similar it is 🤯."
FsvJzfXZI18,More muscle mass than a 7th grader cheerleader is my new favorite insult
FsvJzfXZI18,POV the process of getting earrings in America🗿🗿
FsvJzfXZI18,"Shooter having bad aim ❌️
God's hand saving Trump ✅️"
FsvJzfXZI18,"How about if this was a shoot to miss scenario, following which Trump cut his own ear (very) slightly with a piece of razor blade secreted in his hand?"
FsvJzfXZI18,"Figured you weren't lib or democrat for obvious reasons, but this is great."
FsvJzfXZI18,"in fact, it causes bewilderment and laughter, how these 7 old middle-aged cowards who are waiting for ugly children and an ugly wife and beer, pretend that they are cool))

They stand in such a cool pose. The shorty on the right is especially funny.

In a real fight, all of them would call for mommy, you can always tell by the people they are made of.

About the shooter: you call him a loser and a virgin, but he almost killed the US president, knowing that he would most likely die, this is courageous. It does not matter what the target is. and whether it is good.

And you only shoot at targets, you are afraid to kill someone, you probably want to, because everyone who loves guns wants to kill. You know that this is true.

Ahahahaha, which of you is a virgin and a coward? In my opinion, you are."
FsvJzfXZI18,0.0000.1%
FsvJzfXZI18,Your a Democrat a Democrat would say that it didn't hit him
FsvJzfXZI18,And the guy with the gun killed someone in the crowd
FsvJzfXZI18,Dude it did actually hit him why was Donald Trump bleeding for example that you idiot and the bullet miss and hit other people
FsvJzfXZI18,You are the man.
FsvJzfXZI18,Peiple who think trump wasn't shot are as dumb as qanon followers who think JFK Jr is coming back to life.
FsvJzfXZI18,That was f*cking cool
FsvJzfXZI18,Sad thing is the people who need to see this video just wont because they are scared weak liberals
FsvJzfXZI18,13:30 “he can’t see without his glasses”
FsvJzfXZI18,6:25 when did Zach Galifinakis start doing GunTube videos?
FsvJzfXZI18,Them all standing around the camera and cheering at the video is so good.
FsvJzfXZI18,"Wow, that ear shot recreation looks brutal! Massive ear damage!"
FsvJzfXZI18,12:17 hold up 2 Brandons?!
FsvJzfXZI18,"Amazing how his ear miraculously repaired itself and showing no traces of a scar, just a few months later... IDK, from outside of murica it looks pretty staged. Still a good video, thanx!"
FsvJzfXZI18,"Not sure why, I am subscribed and I am pretty sure you’ve vanished from my feed for about six months.i had forgotten all about your channel, onto other channel and then magically you reappeared… you would think someone like me with only a dozen or two subscriptions would see my favorite channels regularly. 

Did you piss off the Al GoreYthm?"
FsvJzfXZI18,TRUMP 2024
FsvJzfXZI18,Everyone in this vid got jokes for days I love it 😭👏🏼
FsvJzfXZI18,how the fuck do you miss with that big ass gun. L Aim
FsvJzfXZI18,8:39 How about that ear now? No damage at all? LMFAO. thank yOU! for proving everyone who said he didnt get shot CORRECT! Much appreciated. Stuck footinmouth much trump cultists??
FsvJzfXZI18,you could say he was mega mind after this
FsvJzfXZI18,"The old fashioned movies where the bad guy gets his. If that were true, Trump would be brown bread mate."
FsvJzfXZI18,Eli’s “spectrum gunship” shirt is fuckin rad
FsvJzfXZI18,How does any accomplished marksman miss the target from such close range?
FsvJzfXZI18,"damn, imagine his mom watching this...."
FsvJzfXZI18,"trump: gets slight nick on ear
shooter: catches huge bullet with fucking TEETH"
FsvJzfXZI18,um so basically from the pictures of the shooter there really wasn't much left of him? pretty graphic or was iit just a shot in an out ? been curious on that
FsvJzfXZI18,"13:08 “sniper rifle. I know how to use this.”
Karl Fairburne : 1944"
FsvJzfXZI18,"lot of Blah here ... but IF i use a Assault rifle , 130ms , not HEAD -> BODY! blah!"
FsvJzfXZI18,"that was a try to ""make it look like""! .... 2 , 3rd (today)  ? in 2 months ? ..... even not Adolf Hitler had so much in that time! i am sorry to say ! that amateurs was ""pawn sacrifice"" ! if SOMEONE really want the KILL , you hire a PRO (that can retire, after job) and it makes the world a better place!..... i am ex-sniper ! i do not bring a ""assault-gun"" for a kill , and no way you will spot me ! so all that ""attempts"" was basic a fake! make Donny D. kind of a Jesus that he is NOT! .... basic fault if you really dont like Trump! DO NOT HIRE AMATEURS!"
FsvJzfXZI18,Trump put all his skill points into luck
FsvJzfXZI18,So how does an inexperienced kid with no idea what he's doing get that close with a very noticeable rifle and get on top of a roof with it and nobody notices or does anything? And you say it's not staged lol
FsvJzfXZI18,"do you think a left trans is going to sit and watch your video with logic?
they ver kha is are already screaming"
FsvJzfXZI18,"wow! really so crazy he is alive. i thought the guy would have used a scope! to think it was so close as it was! so easy to say with everything happening, a competent shooter with a good weapon could unalive anyone really. wow this video and all the events involved are crazy"
FsvJzfXZI18,Doesn’t this video prove he wasn’t shot 😅
FsvJzfXZI18,What time restraints were you under for this video? I'm a bit confused.
FsvJzfXZI18,The Lego sound caught me off gard XD
FsvJzfXZI18,"The misinformation on X etc is done mostly using bots, one side seems to capitalise on using this method to promote itself"
FsvJzfXZI18,"I don't believe the glass theory, but when people present it as an explanation that it was faked, it makes me roll my eyes. Where did the glass pieces come from?? Regardless of what hit his ear, he was being shot at!! 🤦"
FsvJzfXZI18,I was scrolling in the comments and there was A SECOND ASSASSIN ATTEMPT? Now I kinda feel bad (no I’m not “on the trump side”) but I still am glad that he didn’t die
FsvJzfXZI18,When I saw this event on a video the gun did not sound like an ar 15 (even though it was) but that is just to me but to me (I’m not to much of a gun guy) the gun sounded like a ruger up closer but I think it’s cause the audio wasn’t the best
FsvJzfXZI18,Says its crazy that its staged doesnt recreate from 130 but does for the shooter
FsvJzfXZI18,"No strike for this video. It was a home run with bases loaded! 😊 The best part was showing how he got his ""forever"" box checked in super slow motion.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  
👍👍SCIENCE👍👍"
FsvJzfXZI18,4:07 that’s wild
FsvJzfXZI18,Rumor has it that Melania is still super pissed off. 😂😂😂😂
FsvJzfXZI18,king trout was damn exited to hear that question 9:40
FsvJzfXZI18,How would nobody behind him have not been hit?
FsvJzfXZI18,"didn't a couple of people die during the shooting? the us government would not take innocent American lives, and nobody loves trump enough to do a staged murder-suicide. my dad (a woke conspiracy theorist) thought that because trump was a wrestler, that he would be good at staging himself getting hurt, he thought that maybe trump had a razor blade on his hand. this is why I have to be a ""center"", so I don't have a miserable time talking to my dad whenever we hang out."
FsvJzfXZI18,"the problem is that no one behind trump was hit by the projectile that passes trump, in reality at least one person would be hit (perhaps dead) by that projectile. and no one fell over dead or appeared to be hit. and how can you only bend over after having pressed your eardrums completely so that you would be completely deaf afterwards (this can also be seen on slow motion movies)😁😉 so the man would be completely deaf afterwards and have great pain inside his ear. and as for hitting at that distance with a red dot is no problem, we shoot with a red dot on all the way out at a distance of 200 to 300 M and hit the spot, we don't take off our red dot and put another scope on ( It wouldn't be possible to do it in a real war, would it?. this is with a military red dot and it cannot be set to a different distance either, it is used for close combat normally but can still be used to hit from a long distance . so he must be a really bad shooter. it was not a red dot sight he used but a sniper sight😁😉so it is not correct to use a red dot sight and say it was like that😉the whole world has seen what kind of weapon he used and what kind of aim he used. so don't show something fake and not real as it wasn't a red dot sight he used but a sniper sight🤣😉regardless of whether you like trump or not, you MUST tell the truth and not a lie"
FsvJzfXZI18,12:18 what I fell like when I see a pic of him
FsvJzfXZI18,"You can clearly see trump's ear now and it's obvious his ear never exploded.  That was clear a few days after it happened.  And that would have sprayed a huge amount of blood all over the place, which didn't happen.

What a bunch of dumb fucking gun nut douche nozzles."
FsvJzfXZI18,"New information:  Local Police and multiple audience members informed Secret Service that there was someone on the roof in camo with a Range Finder AT 1738 HRS.  
(6:11:33 FIRST SHOT FIRED)

Which begs the question, WHY DID THE S.S. Team NOT ACT IMMEDIATELY UPON THIS INFORMATION?!!

Were they in collusion with the shooter?  IF so, WHY AND FOR WHAT REASON?!!"
FsvJzfXZI18,"It was totally a fake assassination attempt to make trump look tough when we all know he is a draft-dodging coward.
Bone Spurs have never stopped him playing Golf!"
FsvJzfXZI18,So what was that father who died hit with? A bird?
FsvJzfXZI18,"I heard Melania said ""I would have bought the guy a Leupold!"" But seriously... 45 suffered no tissue damage. Weird. That's the strange thing... your tissue simulated ear is munged."
FsvJzfXZI18,"I love when people say ""conspiracy theory"". It lets me know who the true sheep are."
FsvJzfXZI18,King Trout absolutely ripping a heater at 4:17
FsvJzfXZI18,I love how realistic the dummy is I mean the gel is even orange😂
FsvJzfXZI18,Did they really call it a AK15(Time 5:39)
FsvJzfXZI18,"Why so much hate for the DPMS? I've got one and it's a great gun. I've had it for 17 years and I've shot over 5,000 rounds through it and it still works great. I was an FFL for 20 years and sold a lot of them and never heard negative feedback."
FsvJzfXZI18,"No visible damage, no medical report, no real attempt!"
FsvJzfXZI18,"That experiment was worthless, it was based entirely on the premise that Trump was the target, which he was not. The only explanation that works, is that there was a competent shooter as well as the 20 year old. the competent shooter fired one shot and that was at the teleprompter, that was also the cue for Trump to grab his ear. While he was hiding behind the podium, he self inflicted a scratch to the top of his ear, with either a fingernail or more likely a small rough object. His minders were in on the scam. In real life, they would not have lifted him up until the area had been completely cleared and Trump would have been suffering from shock, not from the small wound, but from the attempt on his life, he would not have been waving his fist courageously in the air. The 20 year old was the one who fired into the crowd, while the competent shooter left the scene. Alternative the young shooter might have been a better shot than thought and hit the teleprompter, but that is unlikely without a scope on the rifle. What makes this theory a certainty, is the multiple reports from the crowd, to the minders, that there was a gunman on the roof and they ignored it. One also has to consider Trumps personality, he is convinced that he needs to be president and will do anything to get the sympathy vote. I am surprised that the police are not chasing him for murder, as a man died in the crowd."
FsvJzfXZI18,Real storm trooper aim right here 🔥
FsvJzfXZI18,"Donut fuckin kills me bro... ""Godspeed ya lil asshole"" Epic!!"
FsvJzfXZI18,A ballistic dummy can't move his head to the right
FsvJzfXZI18,A couple months later. Where's the scar? *shrugs*  - Insert triggered Communists below
FsvJzfXZI18,I am just at a loss to explain how Trump’s ear healed so quickly. So did he slap it with a vial of blood on the way to the ground? Regardless of the aim of the sniper…
FsvJzfXZI18,what if we he was aimming for the poor guy from behind and trump had an mechanism just so to bleed his ear none in now days can unlive a us president only cia can do that if someone can do that none is safe
FsvJzfXZI18,Rubbish turn the model to the right slightly
FsvJzfXZI18,Trump turned his head to the right do the same with your mock up then its fair 😂
FsvJzfXZI18,"Is it a representative democracy when those who steal elections represent only their interests, not ours? We have a kleptocracy, not any kind of democracy."
FsvJzfXZI18,Your shot at the Trump head created enough damage to where it would have been extremely visible for probably the rest of his life being that ear cartilage scars very visibly and he did not so much as show a sign of bruising nor a tear or a hole the next time his ear is made publicly viewable. You ignored these realities to keep attention on your intended agenda of sensationalism.
FsvJzfXZI18,I don’t support trump myself
FsvJzfXZI18,Fyi acurracy international made the l96 aka the awp
FsvJzfXZI18,"This doesn't prove it was staged, but... From the time Trump lifted his hand from the podium, and put it to his ear and then kind of made a fist and then duck down..... It was like one second just over one second like he knew it was coming most people startled if they felt something on their ear like that maybe looking around like:  ""what""???"
FsvJzfXZI18,This has been proven not so accurate because Crook had a legitimate scope!
FsvJzfXZI18,You guys should have worn demolition ranch t shirts in support of demolition ranch!
FsvJzfXZI18,what’s wrong with DPMS🥲🥲 i’ve had mine for like 12 years
FsvJzfXZI18,MIND BLOWN
FsvJzfXZI18,4:16
FsvJzfXZI18,Rewatching this for the third time. Mr donut looks like he doesn't like leg day 😂
FsvJzfXZI18,it still seems a bit odd how people were pointing out to police and said that they saw a shooter and they didnt do anything to stop the shooter until after trump was hit
FsvJzfXZI18,"Technically speaking 

You can't call him a nerd because he's not even intelligent"
FsvJzfXZI18,"such dumbasses calling it was ""fake"" -.- someone actually DIED you lunatics"
FsvJzfXZI18,"After trump was hit he put his hand to his ear. If u freeze frame it when he moves his hand from his ear after apparently being shot, there is not even a dot of blood on his hand. 🤔"
FsvJzfXZI18,It wasn’t luck but Jesus that saved trump
FsvJzfXZI18,Jesus Christ saved trumps life becuase he is still using trump for America
FsvJzfXZI18,"I saw someone saying it was fake bc the AR is powerful enough that even if he missed within a foot he would be dead😂😂😂 
Dude people hurt my fukkin head😂 I cannot stand people"
FsvJzfXZI18,POV You notice that you have failed to kill Donald Trump as a nameless nerd and virgin
FsvJzfXZI18,13:34 what a bunch of soy boys
FsvJzfXZI18,"2:00 Hello timed viewer you have received a check point, 1 more and you open the shop! (If you arent a timed viewer please leave this comment alone)"
FsvJzfXZI18,0:01 hello timed viewer. ( if you arent a timed viewer leave this comment alone ) I will give you checkpoints soon. So have a good trip!!!
FsvJzfXZI18,trump even said if he never turned his head he was a goner he said qote that chart saved my life
FsvJzfXZI18,FACT IS THERE WAS A SECOND GUY ON TOP OF THE WATER TOWER!!!
FsvJzfXZI18,"This video is obviously fake because they used an AR-15 and not an AK-15.
Also the dummy didn’t have lungs while the AK-15 is famous for its ability to blow out your lungs."
FsvJzfXZI18,It's ballistic head trump.
FsvJzfXZI18,i am only asking because the sound of all of the bullets fired at trump were recorded and i cannot distinguish a difference in the sound of the bullets that were fired at crooks from the sound of the bullets fired by crooks
FsvJzfXZI18,There’s a different conspiracy that he got hit by a drill gun somehow💀💀💀
FsvJzfXZI18,I've nicked my earlobe  once with a wound the size of a ballpoint pen head.  The blood was everywhere.
FsvJzfXZI18,"That ear in the picture was just regular cauliflower ear, from wrestling etc. not anything from being shot 😅"
FsvJzfXZI18,People (the left) be thinking that the ar-15 fires .50 bmg. Which they are not wrong according to the ATF.
FsvJzfXZI18,pls add subtitle. i can't hear you because i'm deaf.
FsvJzfXZI18,lets go brandon!!
FsvJzfXZI18,"""...a little graphic, a little unnecessary..."" you left out a little hilarious; great video!"
FsvJzfXZI18,"Wow, imagine not seeing a comet when you look down a red dot 😭😭"
FsvJzfXZI18,the republican slow-mo guys
FsvJzfXZI18,"Maybe he was not hit by a bullet at all ??
Maybe the cutting actually occured while he was on the ground ??
Re-look at the videos as he was not bleeding on the way down.
Think of magic and slight of hand... Making look like something when the switch is made in another way.
Peace"
FsvJzfXZI18,how loud is that sniper rifle compared to an AR-15?
FsvJzfXZI18,Imma choose trump as my skin in cod for a smaller hitbox
FsvJzfXZI18,"I'm so glad that the Former President is doing okay. God bless this wonderful man, and I wish him the best of health and fortune. He has been blessed with lots of protection from the big guy above.

But someone else did."
FsvJzfXZI18,FYI us left eye dominant love a one right  handed bolt action second shot. Can stay on target while Chambering a second round.
FsvJzfXZI18,"How do we know the shooter was actually shot, no blood on roof and no  photos of body."
FsvJzfXZI18,14:33 isn't that all News/Media and so called experts
FsvJzfXZI18,I know you’re doing this for educational purposes but I’m just waiting for the cops or FBI to bust down your door and ask what your intentions are with this video lol
FsvJzfXZI18,Who is here after the 2nd attempt?

FsvJzfXZI18,"so this a an advert 
pfff, what a waste of time"
FsvJzfXZI18,That sniper compared to that nasty gun the shooter used is the definition of “chad v virgin”.
FsvJzfXZI18,"In the meantime we have not seen any pictures of the so-called damaged ear nor have we seen the hospital documentation and photos. 
Explain to me why they're hiding that worldwide Trump is refusing that information to be released.."
FsvJzfXZI18,"I liked this video, but it pisses me off how you guys were making fun of Trump’s “shooter”"
FsvJzfXZI18,You can take my ears but you cant take my liberty
2fInNHRtaHg,It should be displayed on the screen when a candidate doesnt answer the question. Real quick everyone would see that its a dog and pony show where nothing is answered and its just deflections.
2fInNHRtaHg,"Love the sworn affidavit that proves ABC cheated for Kamala and that Kamala cheated the debate. She got the questions, limited the questions she's asked, made sure she wasn't ""fact checked"", while also making sure Trump was ""fact checked"" even though those ""fact checks"" were provable lies. Like the FBI crime statistics. Oh and so much more BS to help the cheaters ""win"". The debate was a sham and a lie, it was a 3v1 gang up that lied and cheated all to ""help"" Kamala. They cheated and lied to help kamala. If they, the power elite, are willing to cheat for a debate what else will they cheat on? 

You're a lawyer, you should go through the affidavit and discuss it with your audience. Tell your audience how a sworn affidavit holds real value and should be trusted as fact."

2fInNHRtaHg,"fact check, Trump vs. Biden was the 1st presidential debate"
2fInNHRtaHg,They never fact checked Kamala.
2fInNHRtaHg,"Ohhh please.....trump has no idea anymore , tbh i was on side most of the time,  but the moment he doesnt want to do anything against  woke mob or fixing actual issues like housing, Healthcare and education then he's politically dead for so many....aright..... fix immigration...give baaaaack those jobs the immigrants are taking, which btw the ones he's talking about are the white collar ones....which again, arent being taken by illegals 😂and then what?... he has no ideas anymore he runs his mouth using the same warhorse over and over ..."
2fInNHRtaHg,"This was a rigged debate. Questions were given to Harris ahead of time. The commentators were bias to Harris. 
     It’s ridiculous the amount of unaccountability that Harris doesn’t have to answer regarding the past 3 1/2 years of her current actions . They have cleaned up her imagine across social media platforms. 
    msm is continuing to cover and distract people with rubbish instead asking who is running current administration? Applying same pressure and hard questions to Harris.
     Trump did well. Wasn’t totally his best, but still brought out facts. 
I find it interesting  they pressing Trump for his healthcare policy , while VP  Harris has not  written down or voice anything of significance regarding ANY policy she proposes to do since the push out of Joey."

2fInNHRtaHg,I think you could have pointed out a bit more the apparent partisanship of the two so called moderators.  The tone and combative word choice used towards Trump vs the softer tone and actually assisting Kamala with answers to their questions could be a video in itself.  Otherwise I think you did great.
2fInNHRtaHg,"I think Trump lost the debate, but it's worth remembering that they are running to be commander in chief, not debater in chief."
2fInNHRtaHg,Trumps team having him refuse another one is a HUGE mistake! Instead they should do their job & at least try & negotiate a fair one & actually prep him!
2fInNHRtaHg,"Yes, it was biased, but by now they should expect that and they should’ve prepared him way more and I think it’s a huge mistake having him refuse a second debate if they actually did their job and negotiated a fair debate and he would win!"
2fInNHRtaHg,Trump has been doing interviews and Townhall’s nonstop and he did way better in all of those his team and advisor should be fired immediately
2fInNHRtaHg,"Clearly, all the good campaign advisors are too afraid to work with Trump out of fear. The DOJ will “trump” up some charges because that debate showed the difference between a good team that did nothing but prepare her and a bad team that didn’t prepare him at all"
2fInNHRtaHg,Trump’s team not only didnt prepare him for what should’ve been an expected biased debate but now instead of doing their jobs they’re just having him refuse a second one! You cant win half assing it team 😢
2fInNHRtaHg,"Yes, the debate was biased, but Trump’s team should’ve expected that by now and should’ve prepared him. It seems like he went in that alone and just winged it"
2fInNHRtaHg,Trumps team not only allowed a moderator whose been openly good friends for Harris for years but then didnt prepare him at all!
2fInNHRtaHg,"Personally, I thought the whole thing was a shitshow. Moderators were clearly bias against Trump, and both candidates spent all their time demonizing each other instead of talking about policies.

All I want is an actual debate where the moderator doesnt get invovled outside asking questions, making sure those questions are actually answered, and following up with more questions to ensure the candidates positions are clear. I get that wont happen because its politics, but a guy can dream."
2fInNHRtaHg,"As an outsider and someone who has no voting power in America, I saw that Harris was a typical politician and Trump was a typical egotistical old man.
Summing up, Harris was trying to sell her Party to Americans whereas Trump was trying to sell himself to Americans."
2fInNHRtaHg,The border bill was already applied and the money go to Ukraine except.
2fInNHRtaHg,M he may down himself with the eating the pets but they never fact checked her or pause her just attacks on trump.
2fInNHRtaHg,"Kamala, friends with the head if ABC who introduced her to her husband, and her sorority sister is in the panel. No bias here, right? 🤨"
2fInNHRtaHg,"They're eating the cats,
They're eating the dogs,
They're eating pets!"
2fInNHRtaHg,"Hearing Harris refer to the desire to run on a problem rather than fixing a problem absolutely infuriated me.  She and the Democrats run on the problem of gun violence in every election, while promoting policies that have a zero percent chance of solving the problem.  They know this.  They know that if we could snap our fingers and make every semi-automatic rifle in the country disappear, that we would go from having 40,000 gun deaths a year, to have 39,700 gun deaths a year.  They focus on these useless strategies so that if they ever actually manage to get them passed, they will still be able to run on gun violence.

In fact, I'll make a prediction.  If they ever manage to ban semi-automatic rifles and ""high capacity"" magazines, the next step will not be to ban all handguns, it will be to ban just 9mm ammunition.  Why?  Because 60% of murders are committed using .22 caliber ammunition.  They don't want to do ANYTHING to actual fix the problem.  They want to be able to use peoples fear and heartbreak for political power.  They are depraved.  She is depraved."
2fInNHRtaHg,Appreciate the offer Nate the lawyer I didn't make it through 8th grade and I already know who won it doesn't take a rocket scientist and Trump prove that saying to be right
2fInNHRtaHg,"Many are saying Kamala won the debate. It was definitely one of her best performances so far. Trump also didn't do his best either. He's had much better performances in the past. It was definitely rigged against him. She was most likely coached before, and probably during. However, post debate, Trump got a boost to his numbers over Kamala. Poll numbers are what matters at the end of the day."
2fInNHRtaHg,"As a non-American who's been following this election, I am baffled that it is still a tight election. A great unbiased analysis of the debate. As for my opinion as to who won? Harris. Trump couldn't stay focused on the debate and went off on insane tangents like dogs being eaten etc..."
2fInNHRtaHg,Wish you have spent more time talking about KH comments regarding current active duty military.  She was wrong.  It's a big deal that went unchecked.
2fInNHRtaHg,You didn't fact check the abortion after birth claim. Here in vermont the baby can be aborted after birth. There are other states that allow the same.
2fInNHRtaHg,Everyone saw it was 3 vs Trump on that debate
2fInNHRtaHg,2nd debate....nate....facts matter sir.....🤡
2fInNHRtaHg,"No questions on inflation, the deficit, her genius idea of price controls or any specific questions on the broader economic downturn.

Hmm real mystery what side the ' panel ' was on."
2fInNHRtaHg,"I'm not even American and I feel bad for you guys.

In a few months you have to choose between 2 political candidates who both seem more interested in pointing their finger at eachother and saying ""bad politician"" rather than actually explaining what they believe.

You deserve a better system than that."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Harris was not asked why she lied about Biden health conditions for over 3 years, she covered for him. Questions, if she lied on Biden what else has she lied about.? 😢"
2fInNHRtaHg,She has about as much business being Commander in Chief as i do.
2fInNHRtaHg,"Basically, she didn’t answer one question in that debate, even with the questions given to her ahead of time.  They didn’t fact check her or pushed back on her words salad once"
2fInNHRtaHg,Neither of them won in my book.
2fInNHRtaHg,Trump won.
2fInNHRtaHg,Vote Trump ❤
2fInNHRtaHg,Expectation is more powerful than substance. The biggest mistake Trump made was to belittle Harris as stupid before the debate. If he hadn't  done that more commentators would have given him the victory.
2fInNHRtaHg,Trump 🇺🇸 2024
2fInNHRtaHg,How to know this channel is run by a former Police Officer?  Because only somebody who's willing to work one of the most dangerous jobs in teh world would be brave enough in trying to do this without any spin.  Political equivalent of climbing everest in shorts with a sport instead of a pickax.  Great vid!
2fInNHRtaHg,The person that is lying is the vice-president Kamala Harris.
2fInNHRtaHg,Close the border and fix the problem we have with the migrants.  People leave her rally’s early.
2fInNHRtaHg,"Bruh, you left out 'they're eating dogs'. He lost it right there."
2fInNHRtaHg,Why wasn’t the pet eating lie brought up? That was a definite lie that needed checked. And the lie about deleting babies after they’re born.
2fInNHRtaHg,She has lied from day one she had 3 years to make things better but hasn't done it she is a fake
2fInNHRtaHg,First Presidential debate?
2fInNHRtaHg,"It's crazy that people still don't get it. On Biden & Harris administration, we have inflation which everything is so expensive. Innocent people dying on war between Russia and Ukraine. The conflicts on Israel–Hamas. 
Come on, people. Why still vote for Harris? It's very simple and it's common sense! Think with your brain and not with your feelings and emotions. THINK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2fInNHRtaHg,They both suck. I can’t believe people support either of these idiots. I didn’t even want to watch it because I cant take the BS
2fInNHRtaHg,"Nice video. 
NateTheLawyer, your critique was  fair.
""LAWD'A MERCY!""
Where are the THIRD-PARTY candidates?  AARGH! 😫"
2fInNHRtaHg,"Neither won. They didnt answer the questions. Also, the moderators was unfair with the questions. Since your going to ask the annoying orange about J6, you should ask the cackling camel why hasn't she done anything as Vp for 3 yrs and some change? The debate was useless. Ask and answer questions about the American people's wellbeing. Not grade school crap talking."
2fInNHRtaHg,There are 9 states that allow abortion beyond the 9th month.
2fInNHRtaHg,Did ABC moderators corner her for not answering the questions or just trump?  Nuff said.
2fInNHRtaHg,"She ducked and dodged.  She's a lawyer backed by ABC, MSM and the moderators.  Voting for trump.  👍"
2fInNHRtaHg,"President Trump didn't need to defend illegal aliens, he built a wall, she wanted to push more paperwork. which one works?"
2fInNHRtaHg,Ok so emigrants eating peoples pets and your source is “I seen it on tv” that is extremely irresponsible and the way he would lead off of what he sees on his favorite network
2fInNHRtaHg,"Harris stomped Trump, but she's still a terrible candidate and will not get my vote."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Why are abortions such an issue in America. Roe v Wade should of been overturned, it should never have been passed in the fist place. Any president at any stage could pass an executive order to make abortions legal, Biden could do it tomorrow.
I keep seeing the their is more than a fair chance the Harris had access to the questions before the debate, surly the fact she is good friends with one of the moderators, and the head honcho of ABC should be looked at.
I honestly believe that if Trump wins Antifa and the like will destroy America, and if Harris wins America will go to war with Russia, China or Libya. Either way America is in trouble."
2fInNHRtaHg,How much money did Ukraine benefit out of the bills Harris voted on?
2fInNHRtaHg,What economists? Are these the same as the 51 FBI agents that signed a fake letter?
2fInNHRtaHg,"Ok I wanted to know what the hell trump was going on about the 8 to 9 months abortn. 
Some states have changed to so that doctors have no duty to care only make comfortable the baby once it's delivered. 
Essentially, meaning if a baby could be saved through extra care or operation, they can choose not to (potentially if the baby wasn't wanted and the abortn time had lapsed and carried to term)
Pro life people essentially call this a post birth abortn."
2fInNHRtaHg,"I’m voting trump but holy crap I wish we had decent candidates like Regan, JFK, even Obama spoke eloquently and respectable."
2fInNHRtaHg,"I don't think that was a debate, Trump could have done much better but you can tell he wasn't expecting what situation he ended up in."
2fInNHRtaHg,Allen Lichtman predicted that Kamala will win. Some of his keys to whitehouse are pretty subjective. He gave Harris the charisma key. Can anyone see Harris as charismatic person?
2fInNHRtaHg,Fox
2fInNHRtaHg,"I think this debate was a disgrace to ABC because it showed how one-sided this organization is by helping Kamala Harris during the debate. I don’t know where you actually said that they fact checked her twice during the debate. Maybe you can tell me where in your video but I don’t see any and don’t remember any. I think she could’ve been back checked at least 4 to 5 times that I remember about the debate because of false statements that she made about Charlottesville, bloodbath comment, him blocking care for IVF and a few other that I just can’t remember right now. Also, with the way you added it this video I can tell that you are probably a democrat and support Kamal Harris."
2fInNHRtaHg,"In France, media edited the video ""I'm talking now"" to make us believe Kamala didn't try to talk..."
2fInNHRtaHg,She sounds so inauthentic and rehearsed (poorly)
2fInNHRtaHg,"Kamala gave a mocking performance devoid of her policy stances. She lied about the border, fracking, immigration, and crime. She wasn't challenged by the moderators. Trump in his recalcitrant attitude proved himself under pressure to bull his way forward. He displayed leadership against her mockery."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Nate for as much as people here are complaining about how you were unfair or how don the con got unfairly fact-checked because he lied a hell of a lot more, I think you did a good job giving an unbiased take on the matter. it is just unfortunate that some people won't see that because they don't want to. when that Cheeto puff did good at the debate and dunked on Biden no one complained about anything but now that he has been called out and exposed and put on the spot for his endless lying, all of a sudden it is an issue and the whole show was rigged all along. This is to mention nothing about how both sides indirectly avoided giving direct answers (ofc, they are politicians), yet only the felon's crowd are the ones complaining about the other side doing it. 

I am just tired of election season and I am ready to get out of it and I look forward to the day when I no longer have to see ketchup jesus all over the news. I am tired of having to see idiotic people give bad political takes (on both sides)."
2fInNHRtaHg,"The ""moderators"" were Kamala's, it was so disgustingly clear.
Trump had some errors in his debate methodology - if I was his advisor it never would have happened.
That's why they keep the People suppressed; we're smarter in aggregate than they are in their existence."
2fInNHRtaHg,"That “border bill” did NOTHING but add more agents to process more illegals in faster, not stop a single one of them from being allowed to illegally cross and make themselves complete burdens on us. It normalized allowing thousands per day in illegally. I have read it,it is a complete joke as to any kind of security or stemming the flow, it was just a way to allow them to improve the optics and not have as many piled up before they’re “paroled”"
2fInNHRtaHg,"I’m sick of the Affordable Care Act.  The “wins” have only affected federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid and low to mid income insurance fees.  Meanwhile my employer-based program has gone up $700 in 6 years, I’m paying more for my prescription, and the copays , percentages and deductible have gone up as well.   Get rid of this insurance and you’ll get affordable care."
2fInNHRtaHg,Can you show where she was fact checked twice?
2fInNHRtaHg,I'm talking now 😂😂😂😂 why yall let him COOK bwahahahaha
2fInNHRtaHg,Why do we talk about winning debate.  Decide what issues are important to you and see which candidates line up with these.  Look at past history in office.
2fInNHRtaHg,"I think it’s pretty telling that Harris never got fact checked, and there were plenty of things that needed to be"
2fInNHRtaHg,"My problem is even if i agreed with trump on some ussues, his ego is far too fragile to trust in the role of president. It's too easy to get under his skin. Period."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Trump made mistakes, he got trapped off topic. Amazing the price fixing did not get mentioned, seems like a prime target.
Harris did not talk about policy, Trump is an open book but Harris is still yet to say anything of meaning. 
Harris was strong on personal attacks, kind of funny to see trump as the more straight talker."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Here’s the thing I’ve noticed.
They use the lies because they know Trump will waste his time on the next question trying to defend himself. The moderators know this as well. People know the truth, he’s done great things for us, stay on track and answer the question that the  moderators ask. Don’t take the bait!

Just my opinion."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Any person with common sense would watch the debate and compare apples to apples. Both were in the highest positions in our government and records are available to compare with each other. Of course democrats see the records and say ""Its a pineapple compared to a pea!!"" Slanting the records with lies and omissions and believe that Americans are stupid or will just steal the election from the voters out right.
  One thing I need to say is that I am not a devoutly religious person but when Trump was not killed in the assignation it was a Bonafide Miracle on display for EVERYONE to see. But that Miracle was not for Trump, but for us the people who saw it. God is speaking and the Mainstream media is doing the devils work by not letting YOU see it too.  All evil needs to succeed is for good people to sit by and do nothing. Go Vote."
2fInNHRtaHg,Thank you for the fairness
2fInNHRtaHg,Dude u didn’t mention the triple team or fake fact checks. It was pretty bad.
2fInNHRtaHg,"She got sample questions ahead of the debate.  What is so insidious about the Dems is maybe they won't outright ban fracking, but they will regulate it so much that it will lead to little fracking in any State."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Trump won a three on one debate despite being baited and having a few mistakes. Then again, it's not hard to beat Kamala, who lies about everything."
2fInNHRtaHg,@11:00 he completely answered the question... If it's a state issue the federal government has very limited input especially the executive branch. The Bill wouldn't make it anywhere near President Trump's Desk.
2fInNHRtaHg,Right. Don't respond to the poison pill
2fInNHRtaHg,"Ok I’ll answer who won and why… Trump on points

1) both evaded, lied, and resorted to childish name calling. This is expected of Trump and works for him, Harris loses a point on this 

2) Harris hasn’t had a lot of media interaction and this was her chance to clarify her positions rather than spouting talking points (again she loses here) 

3) trump bought into her distractions and was controlled by Harris’s “poison pills” as Nate put it (Harris wins a point here)

4) somehow Trump won the abortion section. That surprises me and gives a point to Trump (we are 3-1 in favor of trump)

5) unpopular position, but Harris took on the snotty arrogant tone of the stereotypical elitist San Francisco liberal (way more annoying than the cackle and she must never do this again) point for Trump 

6) the “I’m speaking moment” is the only viral moment from the debate (Trump 5-1)

7) avoiding Trump talking about immigration by shifting to crowd size (Harris +1) 

8) post debate, liberal media (the vast majority) supported Harris so in opinions it will give another point to Harris (5-3) 

9) finally the conservative sites say Trump won, liberal claims Harris, but the middle ground and independent have Trump at 53-47 so Trump gets half a point here 

FINAL SCORE 5.5-3.5 in favor of Mr Trump"
2fInNHRtaHg,"The debate looked so biased against Trump, it only helped prove his point about the system being rigged.  What they should have done was had one MSNBC moderator and one Fox News moderator to balance things out.  But then Kamala might have refused to participate.  But yeah to independents, the way the debate was conducted only helped Trump look like the Underdog and he'll get more votes our of it."
2fInNHRtaHg,Second Presidential debate. Biden was first.
2fInNHRtaHg,That immigration bill was trash. It didnt get passed because it allows for up to thousands of illegals to cross into the U.S. daily. Its not even worth answering the question.
2fInNHRtaHg,Damn her voice is sooo grating..sooo irritating 2 hear her speak...how the house bear her i wonder
2fInNHRtaHg,"Sounds like the left wing media in Australia is out again to pit against Trump...

Trump should never take the bait...  He's to be smarter than that as Kamala was deliberate on that."
2fInNHRtaHg,"It was a typical presidential debate. They misconstrue everything to trick people into electing them. With social pressure, it seems to be enough for people who aren't really paying attention."
2fInNHRtaHg,Vice President won.
2fInNHRtaHg,I smell that Nate won’t be voting for trump lol
2fInNHRtaHg,"Trump has been explaining his plans for the entire campaign. The ENTIRE campaign. Kamala has been dodging and avoiding questions about what she plans to do, even after she was shoed into the race with just a few months left, when she should be taking every opportunity to make sure the American people are fully informed about her plans.  But she refuses to give that to Americans, and focuses on trying to fear-monger about Trump and the debunked rumors about him. Kamala has no plan."
2fInNHRtaHg,"I think trump did better and this is my unbiased opinion 🤔  however i believe  he was not in try hard mode , he has been the most genuine  on his stance and not only to try and do more for the people.  After all he has had some newer folks, and dems to join him but its a hard fight against not just the dems but he has to fight some with the republican party as well. I was raised conservative  republican untill my teen and pre teen years i became liberal democratic now iam independent conservative  🤣"
2fInNHRtaHg,"Wow! I realize I don’t belong here. I thought this channel was neutral terrain, and I truly enjoyed most of the videos on this channel. However,  there are way too many Maga people here, who can’t think for themselves. They believe everything that man says. Even the journalists of his favorite news channel said he lost the debate, but quickly changed the narrative afterwards. I’m out."
2fInNHRtaHg,😂😂😂😂 just dropped my video I worked on all day today and here you go dropping the same thing hours before me hahaha I don’t know how we are thinking alike. Great video.
2fInNHRtaHg,"The border bill Kamala talked about would have made legal 5000 adult illegal immigrants enterring the US each day with an unlimited number of minors each day.  That would not solve the border issue that would just legalize the illegal immigration and solve nothing.

Kamala said she lowered insulin costs but that was after Trump did that first.  It seems that Trumps good policies were cancelled by the Biden Harris admin then quietly reinstated.  

The moderators nevever fact checked Kamala, they did a slight pushback twice but did not fact check her many lies during the debate.

Kamala supported the violent race riots of 2020 and supported defund the police.  So did the entire Democrat party who was in power at the time and now they are rewriting history to claim they never supported that.  Wheres the fact check?"
2fInNHRtaHg,"Can't wait for Nate' ""unbiased"" opinion. 
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 
Prediction
Nate: Harris won the debate."
2fInNHRtaHg,Trump vs Harris et al.
2fInNHRtaHg,"I don’t think neither won.  Perhaps, Trump missed opportunities to capitalize but he didn’t.  He did fine but not as expected.  And the same for Kamala."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Sorry Nate, you present the moderators as non-biased. They definitely were not."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Trump was strong and Harris was weak on abortion, but everywhere else Harris trumped Trump.  Abortion should be left to the states."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Trump was more honest, more passionate, and had better positions.
Harris had better strategy and manipulation tactics. She baited him often and he bit A LOT. But she brought nothing of value or substance to the table. Harris brought a Rhetorical Railgun shooting blanks, while Trump was lobbing nukes with a slingshot.

Harris performed significantly better than expected, she showed lawyer chops. But not Nate the Lawyer chops, more Saul Goodman chops - sleazy, corrupt, and underhanded."
2fInNHRtaHg,They did not fact check her at all I could be wrong I only watched some of it on YouTube until it quit working on here
2fInNHRtaHg,Complaining about the refs. First sign of a loser. Trump took the bait every time. It was like Bugs bunny vs elmor fudd
2fInNHRtaHg,12:15 Obozocare is a fucking disaster
2fInNHRtaHg,"""ABC News rebuked by pro-life group, asked for correction of abortion claim by debate moderator"" not biased at all"
2fInNHRtaHg,This whole comment section be like “this doesn’t agree with my own personal bias therefore this video is biased!”
2fInNHRtaHg,"There were no moderates if you call that moderation, I'm gonna stop watching your channel because that's not an objective observation."
2fInNHRtaHg,Love your channel
2fInNHRtaHg,That border bill had so much pork in it that it didn’t deserve to even be brought to a vote.
2fInNHRtaHg,"no one won the debate.
American citizens lost."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Nate. You also forgot that there is video and audio evidence  of Kamala in 2019 saying she would absolutely ban fracking 
- also done multiple interviews where she openly says she will enforce mandatory gun buyback. 
-  she also used the Bloodbath and Charlotsville rehtoric that even CNN and Snopes had to debunk... 

- and did you see biden and kamala at the 9/11 Memorial?  They left when the victims family gave a speech.... like a buch of cowards.   Afraid to face the people who they betrayed when they gave a sweetheart deal to one of the conspirators"
2fInNHRtaHg,Harris is terrible. Please 🇺🇸 no.  A concerned foreigner
2fInNHRtaHg,I can tell you right now that these wider problems are going to matter less and less while billions of dollars of fentanyl keeps coming in full-tilt.
2fInNHRtaHg,"Trump won the moment he said, ""Let's leave the debate floor right now because this has been a waste of time anyway. If she cares so much, go down to Washington DC and wake joe abiden up^  

You don't need a bill. An executive order can be issued.   If you listened to the senate hearing today, the commander of the border patrol along with people who are victims of the crimes that occurred due to illegal immigration, testified that the officers are not allowed to question their immigration status.  Executive order 50 allowed catch and release.      

Who is responsible for this order?    Commanders response, Kamala Harris with authority of President Joe biden.... 

Check..... mate......"
2fInNHRtaHg,Still managed to make a biased recap.
2fInNHRtaHg,MSNBC are approaching unlawful levels of cringy.
2fInNHRtaHg,This was the SECOND Presidential debate... not the first.
2fInNHRtaHg,"You know, nobody likes a cheater. The moderator and Harris are sorority sisters. The ABC Exec in charge of news are buddy's with Harris. It definitely didn't help Trump to not know what the questions were going to be asked, unlike Harris"
2fInNHRtaHg,8:17 yes his rallies are good
2fInNHRtaHg,"Context is important on the boarder bill.  Yes the bill would have hired more people for boarder patrol, BUT, and here's the context, the bill said that those extra agents where for processing people who come here illegally, NOT for securing the boarder.

From a political standpoint it's genius.  It let's democrats say they want to pass a bill that increases boarder patrol agents honestly, which the uninformed voter hears as closing the boarder, while it actually does the opposite since it means they can process more people coming into the USA per day."
2fInNHRtaHg,"ABC weren't on the side of the American people in this debate. They clearly had marching orders. People forget that this is Trump's second debate with the Democratic party in power. After the first debate eliminated the current president they were going to make sure they touted their selected replacement, regardless of if she actually answered any questions or not. Her policies are put into question when she has the authority to make things happen in her current position. She's pretty much the president NOW considering Biden was Old Yellered weeks ago. No one knows who's really in charge."
2fInNHRtaHg,I'm only disturbed that he actually shook that b****'s hand she could have put some poison on it or something right  clearly a  witch
2fInNHRtaHg,"She needs to do the next debate at Fox. Its only fair, and if she so handily won, what's the problem?"
2fInNHRtaHg,"Oh, those expressions from Kamala making me feel aggressive all over again. 😮"
2fInNHRtaHg,5:35 Trumps not in office....he can't kill any bill.
2fInNHRtaHg,"Dear Nate, I never paid any attention to politicking until Bernie back in 2015. I was a Canadian Bernie Bros and majority of my Twitter peeps were the same.
Thanks to Bernie's delegates I witnessed outstanding shenanigans by the DNC to elect HRC. That didn't work out well. Now it's 'brown' HRC and she'll probably win. 
Neither Trump nor Harris have anything meaningful to debate because their donors are playing chess.
I am done with any enthusiasm over politicking because nothing will change regardless who is elected."
2fInNHRtaHg,This was a debate. ABC was after Trump not fair.
2fInNHRtaHg,My debate analysis Kamala pitched a good game and scored a lot of runs. The umps made a few bad calls. Problem is this was a boxing match not baseball.  She had the wrong objective going in. Independent voters wanted reassurances by hearing about her plan. She somehow thought the mission was to get under Trumps skin.
2fInNHRtaHg,"14:40 Her values have never changed! 😂
Trump missed an opportunity here and went to different topics."
2fInNHRtaHg,"I think he got baited too easily.  

I think she knew she could lie with no repercussions."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Nate,
Thanks for the insight and starting the conversation. Would you do the fact checking on the comments made during the debate both Trump and Harris (mediators too) and post your findings in a video? I trust you'll be neutral and share your thoughts objectively."
2fInNHRtaHg,It was a finger pointing event. It was 3 fingers vs 1 finger. But it was that 1 finger that counts
2fInNHRtaHg,"Lol.  If Trump can't handle Kamala's bait, what gives you the impression he'd do any better with a master baiter like Vlad?"
2fInNHRtaHg,ABC moderators:kamala why are you so wonderful?
2fInNHRtaHg,"Greate analysis! For the first question, if he just said, ""What a Huuge word salad that was!"", and then give the question back to her."
2fInNHRtaHg,The border bill was a Ukraine bill.
2fInNHRtaHg,Kamala destroyed Trump. 😂 Trump does not want to respond because he can’t. Kamala wiped the floor with agent orange ass. 😂 He’s not gonna go back to another debate because he was sunk like the titanic 😂
2fInNHRtaHg,Kamala is holding us hostages until she wins.
2fInNHRtaHg,"I don't like either one of them, but I can't do another 4 years of our current leadership. I was getting a head with Trump in office, but I lost that ground and more with the current leadership."
2fInNHRtaHg,The biggest fallacy I saw was the moderators fact checking Trump on Haitians eating pets while saying nothing on Kamala when she brought up “bloodbath” and “fine people” lies. This summed up the entire debate.
2fInNHRtaHg,"It was mistake by Trump.  ABC couldn't have been more partisan if they tried.  Not only did they not fact-check her, even worse, there are allegations that ABC fed Kamala the topics.  We'll see that plays out, though I wouldn't doubt because the DNC and liberal press have spent years working together to promote Democrats."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Hi Nate ! I love listening to your takes. Be careful not to fall for audience capture too much. That's why I stopped following Viva Frei. But you seem more balance so I keep coming back to your videos. 

My take of the debate was that they both dodge questions. Harris was probably more staying on point. Trump was rambling a lot more. I noticed that they fact checked him a bit more but he was rambling so much, and he tends to just talk about random stuff that he sees on the internet. They did allow him to have the final word on every single point I believe. Harris tried to have the final word once but she was shut down by the moderator. I'd say the debate was pretty fair if you take both those things into account. Last election I was definitely more on Trump side, but I flipped back to the center with what happened on January 6. And I just can't support what Trump did then. Any other republican candidate and I would probably support the republicans. so I'm supporting Harris this time."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Ooof the comment section is calling this one a L, Nate. Respect you immensely but this wasn’t your best work."
2fInNHRtaHg,"He should not have called her a ""radical left liberal"". Alot of people who won't vote for Kamala consider themselves ""liberals"".

Trump is actually really liberal on abortion, except when he's campaigning for President and lying to the Cathololics. ...but the Democrats and their media lapdogs are already lying about his abortion stance so much that he doesn't need to lie about it this time around.

By the way, if you analyze his words closely, Trump actually does NOT lie very often. ...contrary to the frequent accusations."
2fInNHRtaHg,This dude said the fact checked her twice. Where? 😂😂😂😂
2fInNHRtaHg,"Asking Harris about policy is not the same as the several real-time fact checks Trump got, rescuing Harris.  Those are two different things.  And everybody saw it happen."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Just ordered some pizza, twice what it was just a couple months ago, don't think im better off than i was four years ago"
2fInNHRtaHg,You can tell she has someone speaking fast in her ear because she stumbles a lot trying to keep up. Like running over words.
2fInNHRtaHg,"You forgot to mention how the moderators where answering and filibustering, that’s not their job."
2fInNHRtaHg,I have to disagree….She was not fact checked….she intentionally lied 🤥 and was left to it
2fInNHRtaHg,"Trump killing the border security bill... he didn't deny that accusation at all. I was shocked because I thought for sure that was baloney. I read the bill. It was awful. And Biden could have fixed the problem with appointments, and Executive Orders, and Presidential Directives. They didn't need a crummy bill. ...but Trump didn't deny the accusation that he told Congress to kill the bill so that Biden wouldn't get the credit.

So I guess the accusation was true?"
2fInNHRtaHg,"Good catch that the moderator actually tried to help Trump stay on track when Harris baited him with the rallies.

I hadn't noticed that before."
2fInNHRtaHg,"At one point, both a moderator and Kamala “fact-checked” Trump about 3rd trimester abortion, but it seems like the only people catching that those ""fact-check"" statements were lies are pro-life advocates. Abortions can and do happen in the  3rd trimester. I think it’s important to know this and hold people accountable to where they are drawing the line for when abortions should not be allowed."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Some company came out and said they have blue tooth devices disguised at ear rings identical to what she had in and offered some for Trump, as well as the ABC whistleblower saying Kamala had the questions ahead of time, and especially the female moderator, was a long life friend and sorority member of Harris. And finally the “fact check” on Trump about the Haitian immigrants (Harris admitting years ago to letting them in) saying their city manager said “there’s no credible source on immigrants eating cats” despite videos, police reports, and immigrants themselves, proving they are"
2fInNHRtaHg,Neither won. They both just regurgitated the same talking points that we have been hearing throughout their campaign. But one point I would give Trump. Foreign nations would rather work with Harris because she would be a complete pushover.
2fInNHRtaHg,"The Fox host was the only objective voice in the moment. 
I'll agree that Trump allowed himself to be baited and thus got off topic a few times, but his final statement asking her why she didn't do these things over the past 4 years made it a tie. 
Finally as the days have gone by and we've let it marinate, it became clear that she had no specifics to anything and that he Moderators were bias."
2fInNHRtaHg,She 100% in 2020 said she would ban fracking.
2fInNHRtaHg,"My girlfriend is a nurse at a local hospital, they absolutely are aboorting late term children. It is happening"
2fInNHRtaHg,Trump stepped into the ring against three of them. And still walked out with his head up high. He has my vote.
2fInNHRtaHg,No one voted for Kamala Harris. The dems are stealing our democracy
2fInNHRtaHg,Trumps closing statement was all we needed to hear.
2fInNHRtaHg,"My opinion:

Kamala won on the optics. She was polished and well prepared, even though she didn't answer any of the questions directly or even indirectly.

Trump won when it came to answering the questions and substance, even when it was lost inside his rants when he took the bait over and over from Kamala.

So for me, Trump won.

I may not like the way Trump talks and acts, but at least I know what he stands for and his policies. I can't trust Kamala because she refused to answer the questions. Makes me feel like she is unsure of what answer to give.

We need someone who at least is confident enough in his ideas that he is willing to state them and take the criticism that may come from it."
2fInNHRtaHg,Trump asked Harris if she would put a restriction at 7 or 8 months and she refused to answer.
2fInNHRtaHg,"I think the debate was a null point.  I don’t think either one did a good job of directly answering questions.  And I don’t think either one convinced undecided voters.  Trump fans and Harris fans will say their candidate won.  I do think the moderators helped Harris more than they helped Trump.

Feel free to disagree."
2fInNHRtaHg,"In my opinion, it's a draw between Trump and Harris and we need round two."
2fInNHRtaHg,I hate to say but the first question is since Biden took office everybody in America has been paying more then four thousand a year for middle class. In my case I've paid five thousand the first year and all most eight thousand the last three years . And you can fact check that.
2fInNHRtaHg,She’s a stooge
2fInNHRtaHg,No comment on the transgender illegal alien surgeries? Or the imigrants eating pets? I felt he came off unhinged
2fInNHRtaHg,Winner of the Debate: Nobody!  Big Losers: The American People.
2fInNHRtaHg,The US is 100% owned & run by Israel !
2fInNHRtaHg,"Debate was a wash . . .she baited Trump, and he took the bait . . . anyone who was looking to understand anything about KH's policies and how she would differ from Biden, were very disappointed . . . neither won . . . neither lost . . ."
2fInNHRtaHg,"They bought the obvious points of criticism towards Kamala to seem objective, but never fact checked her or pressed her on the lies even once. Meanwhile, with Trump they fact checked him wrongly, or even giving personal opinions and trying to pass them as fact checks. The people who can’t see the overt outrageous bias, clearly will think it’s either justified cuz Trump is orange man bad = evil, or cuz Kamala didn’t lie at all, which there’s plenty of footage contradicting her own words."
2fInNHRtaHg,"My original reading on the day of the debate was that by the end, Harris had the edge.

Now that the dust has settled and time has passed, I’ve noticed that peoples minds have changed in favour of Trump. Kamala’s overly dramatic smugness and snide remarks did not do her any favours. Further, she made a huge mistake by giving Trump the opportunity to correct long held misconceptions about what happened on Jan 6 and the “fine people on both sides” comments. 

It seems that many swing voters took a more emotional/intuitive read of the debate than what lawyers and political pundits viewed it. 

Just my thoughts."
2fInNHRtaHg,"So one of the ""journalists"" from ABC is Kamala's sorority sister?  Oh, no bias there, I'm sure."
2fInNHRtaHg,"Nate the Coward was here.  He could have referred to the Ground News analysis, if he didn't wanna weigh in personally.  Instead, he asks, ""What do you think"".  

Cut the b.s.  Bet this:  Nate has a MAGA hat behind the  camera.

Why hide it?🤔 It's free speech."
2fInNHRtaHg,"I thought the moderators did a good job overall.  In terms of fact checking, the mods did that only on the craziest of answers such as, Haitians are eating cats and dogs in Springfield Ohio.  They did call Harris on the flip flops she has done. She did not make any crazy statements such as above.  It's not her fault that Trump fell for her bait. He's supposed to be on his toes about those things and ignore them.  I don't know if either one 'won' the debate, but I do think Harris sounded and appeared more Presidential."
N7xHQq2xQGw,What that hes the Democrat underground liberal incognito and a Red Star socialist.we already all knew that
N7xHQq2xQGw,we still have time to kick her out.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Sure took you long enough to wise up about Obama.  Knew he was no good years ago!q
N7xHQq2xQGw,Hey Rogan. Love how you stood your ground!
N7xHQq2xQGw,"if anybody struggles in their life or just needs to talk, you’re welcome to hit me up!
and please remember that you’re not alone out there!🫡"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I'm a deplorable uneducated piece of garbage and proud of it!!! 

🇺🇲✌️🇺🇲✌️🇺🇲"
N7xHQq2xQGw,I was a liberal too.. until it became thwarted into what is it now. Ana Kasparian said it best on the video you posted the other day. They drove us away from the party and we found a home in the conservative party.
N7xHQq2xQGw,KamiLaw Harris wanted to give men in prision sex changes paid by our taxes. Could you imagine if she won and that happened.  KamiLaw is a stain on the election.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Let's be real here.
Kamala lost because she is an airhead and everyone realized that from the debate."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Am I the only one that feels like the extreme left has gone so far left that it makes people that are in the Middle look like they're  on the right.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Good job!
N7xHQq2xQGw,Elon made 20 billion with the news of Trump gett ing reelected. Bravo that was a sweet business move.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Nothing like having a felon in the white house ...rick scott is there, musk all the usual suspects"
N7xHQq2xQGw,Trump will release his taxes...lol
N7xHQq2xQGw,"There was no win for her to do JRE. Because she has so many lies out in the public and course Joe is going to ask thinking she could clear her name but they are lies and its not worth getting called out on lies! Plus she is dumb, they know that and she would be a liability! So they declined and offered something to joe they knew he would not accept."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Cosign nearly everything Joe said
N7xHQq2xQGw,Why did Joe say Trump wore a diaper?????
N7xHQq2xQGw,Your not that important lucky she didn’t become your guys president
N7xHQq2xQGw,"So, while generals are trying to figure out how usurp Trump, they want to instill Kamala due to Biden ineptness, and then they do not want to let Trump take over office as he should, snd people may riot or it may start a form of civil war and she will enact martial law and stay in power… because no one wants her in there.  They would be not only going against Trump, but the majority of the United States who voted for him.   Let’s hope this does not happen…."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"one thing is crystal clear about the democrats, they had a hell of a nerve to say ""freedom"" had any thing to do with Kamala's campaign to become president. the democrats are the furthest thing from the American people getting any freedom from them! every aspect of democrats is to be our overlord nanny's. they want to tell us how to think, what to eat, what we can and can't say, not allow us to have our own opinions about, anything! what doctors we see, what medications we can or cant take, where in all those things and more im sure that ive forgotten, is the FREEDOM part?"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Joe, Elon/X, The Amish and a Squirrel came together at exactly the right time to save the Republic."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I believe Harris thought for sure she would win.  Especially, because she had a litter of Celebrities.  I know a few people that turned and Voted for Trump because of the Celebrities, especially because the crooked Oprah Winfrey supported her. 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I'm on the fence with Joe Rogan. I get it, we make mistakes but Joe supported Obama and Biden. If he was younger I could give him an easier pass but right now; not sure? In a way, he's acting like Harris. ""I was for it but now I'm not"" kinda thing."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"She’ll never find time we’re she has to answer anything,Joe you’re a fence walker you always have been,but you realize no one in their right minds could vote for these communists and that’s exactly what they are"
N7xHQq2xQGw,I’m tired of us picking left or right we pick on who is the best candidate…period this isn’t our favorite football team it’s who has our back as a entirety and who is going to do the most good for us that’s what my and all our decisions should be based on
N7xHQq2xQGw,"It really is insane that the beliefs of right wing conservatives are more in line with the beliefs of the hippies of the 60s and 70s than today’s so called “liberals”. But the truth is, they are calling themselves “liberals” to garner the favor of left wing democrats who are incapable of logical, independent thought. Their beliefs show what they truly are. A basic liberal belief has always been that we should minimize as much as possible, or even eliminate, government interference in the lives of the people. Yet, these socialists are pushing for government to control every aspect of our lives, including what we can say, do, and even think. 

    The Constitution is the law of the land and supersedes all other laws for a reason; to prevent exactly what is being attempted in these sick times. Weak mined people are easily manipulated, but as long as there are people ready and willing to hold our public servants to their oaths, then the type of shit we are seeing today can never succeed. But the Constitution is just a piece of paper if we aren’t willing to enforce compliance with it. Now, I will admit, the recent election results have restored a small amount of hope in me concerning the fight to restore our freedom; however, I can’t help but be pessimistic. The truth is, this country was bought and sold a long time ago, and all the current unconstitutional laws in place are proof that people aren’t willing to do their duty and fiercely defend the Constitution by any means necessary. It’s sad that the biggest threat to this country exists within its own borders. When you let small infringements go, like a cancer, they grow and spread continuously until they are so out of control that you either need to take extreme measures to remove them, or perhaps it’s to the point that you can’t. And even if you succeed, you pay a very, very heavy price."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Good to know!
N7xHQq2xQGw,"The left DO NOT believe in free speech. Kamala mentioned the Constitution in her concession speech, but they prove over and over again, if you are a conservative, free speech and the 1st amendment does not apply or cover you. Not even a yard sign!!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,Smoking in front of non smokers is the lowest blatent intent to subject others to poisen!
N7xHQq2xQGw,It's a simple case of letting them keeps talking and they'll prove themselves wrong. These progressives can't just own their argument.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Rogan 2028
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Anyone who has watched Joe and his guys for long knows that the were Trump guys. They were not going to go after Trump, but they would have attacked Harris. I don’t care what Joe says now! (i enjoy his podcast, I just don’t agree with him on this one)"
N7xHQq2xQGw,She is inept and incompetent so she made excuse over excuse to make sure it didn’t happen and then blame it on Rogan!! What a joke!
N7xHQq2xQGw,She is inept and incompetent so she made excuse over excuse to make sure it didn’t happen and then blame it on Rogan!! What a joke!
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Joes far more intelligent then a lot give him
Credit for."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Librals got infected by Communism
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I'm glad you were able to share your opinion openly. I disagree with your view, but I have to understand what the MAGA side is so excited about? 
The projections are not in the green for Trump"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"She HAS to copy! She has 0 original ideas. A phony DEI hire installed in place of Joe Biden, who has dementia so bad he seems lost, forgets what he was saying and gaffs up the ying-yang. Imagine - she is worse than JB!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Some of us, when shown to be wrong, thank the educator and learn more about it. Happens to me on yt comments for sure. Others call the educator names and bully them. IDK what the difference is in the mind, but I like to learn."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Its funny I have been saying this very same thing since Obama made it into office. I pointed out that all our leadership is operating on Elementary Playground rules. And Now people are finally waking up FFS. We need to go back to Minding our own damn business and keeping government out of our personal lives. absolute power corrupts absolutely!
N7xHQq2xQGw,JOE IS MORE OF A HUMAN THAN HER
N7xHQq2xQGw,But Rogan would ask real unscripted questions.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"We are the ""most intelligent"" specie on earth, but we are highly predictable and easy to manipulate. They literally do virtual simulations and real tests on samples of various kind of people groups before putting anything new into society, with a high level of accuracy. That's how much we are predictable and manipulable. Anyway, it really seems like everything is upside down today. Like Joe said, Liberals acting as conservators and Republican acting as liberals is one of the things."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Kamala knew she would never survive an interview as long as Trump's and she knew Joe, as good a listener as he is, would call her on every word salad and there would be plenty without a script to go from! But aside from not doing a Joe interview, she never gave a press conference either but worst of all when she spoke to the American people she talked down to them like they were kindergardeners! I'm glad Americans are smart enough to see through the ""Influence"" news because it was not about informing us that is for sure. Good show Joe. Glad you had Trump on."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"He learns what the left is, unfortunately didn’t realize that’s how they always were like that"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Man can somebody show me where to go find that meme that says,"" there will never be another campaign like this"""
N7xHQq2xQGw,Rogan just found out about the truth about the parties...Glad he did
N7xHQq2xQGw,Nah
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I listened to the whole JD Vance conversation. It was great. They both talked common sense, never said anything negative about anyone. Joe lets his guests talk, does not interrupt and really listens to them. I was impressed with the whole interview."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Taylor swift has commitment issues. Ahe probably changed her mind before the election.  Now watch. We gonna get a song about it
N7xHQq2xQGw,I have a friend who believes biden fixe the economy and made inflation go down.  He supports her cause trump is bad basically
N7xHQq2xQGw,Joe get back to interesting stuff and leave politics alone it’s a ugly evil place your a good soul keep the moss off it
N7xHQq2xQGw,She has no substance and isn’t really interested in anything except herself so what are you going to talk about. She has no real solution to anything and doesn’t even answer any questions really
N7xHQq2xQGw,Because they are a bunch of snots
N7xHQq2xQGw,I like this channel but has anyone ever noticed that he kinda sounds like Remy from ratatouille
N7xHQq2xQGw,"My guess is that if she did take the invite and JR Convo’d personal like he said, people would’ve gotten to see what she was really like and they might’ve liked her.  It could’ve helped her campaign.  But she and/or her handlers were too leary of an honest conversation and so they kept her at bay.  Big mistake imo.  Had to go with Trump- at least he’s not afraid to speak his mind!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,Didn't they already hand our Rights over to the au?
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I’m so sick of hearing about “white privilege”. WHAT WHITE PRIVILEGE? It’s not the white man’s fault if you are too lazy to get a job and make something of your life. I got a paper route at 10 yrs old and had a job non stop til i was 43 when i retired due to health problems. That’s not white privilege, that’s WORKING FOR A LIVING so i can have things like a house, new car etc."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Trump was a democrat, Kennedy was a democrat, Gabbard was a democrat, Musk was a democrat.  People should look at policy not the name."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"It is a pity that we do not have Joe Rogan in the UK - I would guarantee that staliner / starmer / whatever would not go anywhere near to it as he is just as much a wet lettuce as Harris. Now, Nigel Farage is very likely to appear on Joe Rogan if he were to be invited."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Your thumbnail image looks like Kamala is sucking her thumb... LOL
N7xHQq2xQGw,I speculate that her handlers thought she was to stupid to answer questions without coaching oh yeah Swifty’s are airheads too
N7xHQq2xQGw,Joe rogan used to be super far far left started pushing him to go right so he went right because they didn't like him
N7xHQq2xQGw,P
N7xHQq2xQGw,"You guys don't treat politics as a geopolitical issue. You treat it like a cult. You guys vote not for policies, but for tribalism.

Fact is. Their both the worst people for the job. Neither is qualified for it, neither have policies that don't pander and both line their pockets. 

You guys were fucked no matter who you picked and yet your celebrating it like a win. 


You guys have corporations the same rights as people. 

Not one of your politicians have tried to change that and in turn the need to have profits every year which everyone knows is economically impossible is going to grind democracy into dust.

You folks know that their making your education system so bad to keep the population dumb, yet you don't realise that it's affecting your ability to make rational decisions and see what's in front of you."
N7xHQq2xQGw,GO ROGAN                            LOVE
N7xHQq2xQGw,Man did Harris make plenty of mistakes that cost her the election and one of them is not taking on Joe Rogan interview that alone cost her the election.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Im a convicted  crim, can I run for president?  Gullible yanks!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Right on.  Going to Rogan would be juat anothrr campaign stop.  With the added benefit ofcreaching 100's, if not 1,000's of more people than her usual gatherings.   But, she (or, more accurately, her masters)  would have been able to control the content or the final product."
N7xHQq2xQGw,He talks a lot but doesn't say much
N7xHQq2xQGw,Sounds like Joe is just but hurt that he didn’t get to do Kamala Harris just saying.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Joe Rogan nailed it. Harris was the worst ever dem presidential candidate ever!
N7xHQq2xQGw,Wow!!!! She went to Alex on “Call her daddy “ 🤔
N7xHQq2xQGw,I sure am glad our voices were heard.........bye bye dems.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Don’t come in like Trudeau and expect to be loved!
N7xHQq2xQGw,The pod worry Trump got more views than she got votes 😂
N7xHQq2xQGw,Harris was a proven loser last time she ran.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Joe is right from my perspective the 70's ~ 80's Liberal is the opposite of a 2020's Liberal, they were move like the right of center people of today."
N7xHQq2xQGw,She couldn’t possibly do three hours … 10 mins would be too long 1:42

N7xHQq2xQGw,Thanks for education on Kamala's sheepish ways. More proof we don't need this in a leader.
N7xHQq2xQGw,The harris team wanted to control EVERYTHING
N7xHQq2xQGw,Harris is the most pathetic candidate for POTUS ever.....she couldn't talk for a couple of minutes without sounding like a fool.
N7xHQq2xQGw,The democrats are a cult not a party.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"What is this ignorant, trash fed, immature, likes to take things out of context, throw a tantrum because I didn’t get it my way, smooth brain, low IQ, immature, only think about short term, unapologetically entitled, liberal crap that came across my feed?"

N7xHQq2xQGw,Didn't she show up in person for some sort of sex podcast?
N7xHQq2xQGw,Democrats dont have a platform anymore. Except gain and keep power at all costs.

N7xHQq2xQGw,I wanted to hear what you had to say but I can’t stand all the filler words. Learn the definition of brevity. Saying terms like “exactly literally” makes you sound ignorant. You do it in the first 52 seconds
N7xHQq2xQGw,It’s almost as if the old Democrat party moved right into MaGa and the socialist party disguised itself as Democrats?
N7xHQq2xQGw,"EXTREMELY TRUE, EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINION JUST DON'T SHOVE YOUR OPINIONS ONTO ME! WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE AND LEAVE IT AT THAT!!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"A lot of us were undecided until the very end. This would have been a golden opportunity for Harris to speak to voters like myself. Her refusal to do Joe Rogan's podcast is what made me not vote for her. It made it look like she had something to hide. If you can't do a 2 hour podcast, how in the world are you going to meet with other world leaders and negotiate the future of our country. And if you're always reading a teleprompter, who the hell is writing those teleprompters? She may have still lost even if she went on the podcast but her not going on it had a HUGE impact. Terrible move on her part."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Thank you.  But there was no reason to rant and rage. The facts were enough.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I.M  glad Trup whon , he's  hard to figure  out or what's he's going to say or do but what he saies ,
 He doe's and gets the job done. Hop he keeps up on what he's said  about No taxes on Social security  and  No more Ethics Food money. Who the hell ! That though this was a way  to thrown  Money  to  these Emergents from Rieting in the streets Needs to be huge .

That means SMALL government! Pro Constitution! No mandatory ANYTHING!!! Individuals over collectives. Private property ownership. Small Business, free Enterprise, LOW TAXES, _LOW GOVERNMENT SPENDING!!!_

If you hate that,
I don't care!
Good luck in your new country!

America FIRST!!!"

N7xHQq2xQGw,There has never been a more privileged person on this earth than the white  female.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Identity politics, man. You're 2 sides of the same coin. You're both abundant with hypocrisy and extremely predictable about it."
N7xHQq2xQGw,if what you say is true then the right became the best of both sides.. and the left became the worst of both sides
N7xHQq2xQGw,What were the dems thinking when they picked Harris for leading their party? That was the best they could come up with. That should tell everyone just how sad the dems are.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Kamala H. has not one functioning brain cell....  off course she can't go off script, and have a normal intelligent conversation"
N7xHQq2xQGw,her rallies weren't the right place for anyone who could think for themselves either.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Like the story goes, Joe Rogan has the cookie!! She needed his talent/ coverage….. but missed out. OOOH, what a shame, she lost altogether!! Blessing for the whole world!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"The Democratic Party is dead. That party is run by extreme radical, woke, gay,Marxist, pagan, hedonistic , feminists"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Hey....🙃....Mr Rogan...you and I think alike...it took me 70 years to learn your train of thought.... love your show, big fan...keep up the great way of thinking...speak who you are is always best..🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Roll the clip, hooded figure concealing your identity! (Yes, I'm drunk. Take this with a grain of salt. Everyone gets it, including you who's reading this... fucker... 😂😂😂😂"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"This is something many need to understand: It's not about people suddenly shifiting turning right-wing. It's about the changes that has happened to the left that have given many no choice. If I would be forced to place myself on the political spectrum, I lean much more to the left, but if I'd have to choose a candidate, I would go with Trump every day."
N7xHQq2xQGw,The collective good is a phrase straight out of the communist playbook
N7xHQq2xQGw,Thank God Trump won
N7xHQq2xQGw,Kamala wanted to do the interview but just as long as it wouldn’t expose who she was as a person aka it would be super scripted like her other interviews hence defeating the purpose
N7xHQq2xQGw,"And every speech from Kamala was word for word the same message,   I got bored and started listening to trump."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"And AGAIN many women hate Kamala.   She’s a lawyer,   We hate lawyers."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Joe Rogan was a self proclaimed ""Bernie supporter(Sanders)"" so did he just admit that he's a commie?"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Democrats courted the Elites and Republicans courted the working man,   And people saying stupid shit didn’t matter."
N7xHQq2xQGw,In just like Joe. When I'm a left person but not this left lol there crazy. And I went and voted for trump.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Joe your going to let  Trump have his day with all these Dems he took a lot of bad chit chat said to him and about him he should get his turn
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Joe Rogan : ""My sincere wish is to have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being.""
Commentary GOLD : Yeah that's pretty much Kryptonite for dishonest shady politicians who are kind of lacking in the, ya know NORMAL, natural, human department."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"None of us are going to be worried about any of this stuff soon enough.  Just wait.  If that 10 year yield keeps on going higher EVERYONE is about to get their faces ripped off.  Be kind,  be safe.  Stack food and water the more the better."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"WHAT WOULD YOU TALK TO HER ABOUT, SHE'S A MAKE BELIEVE POLITICIAN, SHE HAS NO OPINION OF HER OWN, SHE DOES AND SAYS, WHAT SHE'S TOLD, SHE'S A COMMUNIST, YEAH IF JOE GAVE UP CONTROL OF HIS PLATFORM, TO A SCRIPED, TAPED, EDITED INTERVIEW,  WHICH ROGAN WOULD NEVER DO, SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IT"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"The right who voted for trump are morons, why ? The mass deportation will cost the government over 1 trillion dollars, and take 500k new immigration officers,1000 more judges ,and over 1000 more Dedention houses,  we only have 1.9 million people in jail, and trump wants to put 23 million people in jail to deport them, and musk wants take 2 trillion from the government budget, ???? Ok so how can you keep paying for Medicare,and healthcare,you can’t , !!! then you want to still give musk 100 billion to go to mars, come on, going to mars is dumb compared to educating our kids,and caring for our disabled ,elderly,kids, and women’s health, but it’s trump who is hiding trump only goes to where he can control everything he is asked ,and so what if they said he should come to her…all media normally comes to the potus and the VPotus so yes they are both more important than Joe R! he is nothing more than a freaking youtuber , and there’s 10yr old kids with the same amount of the followers..and your bs about fake ,your the one who’s fake, and your no5hing but a total lair..trump is the worse lotus in history, he made 8 million dollars from foreign governments,China pad him 5.5 million dollars  without skiing congress for the right to do as under the law..trump is a convicted felon, 31 of them, it simply goes to show that the rich,the powerful,and the criminals are all in each others pockets, and trump is following in Chinas !russia foot steps to take over their country,trump next will try to do away with term limits next.."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Your too white for her  joe  lol
N7xHQq2xQGw,Republicans cheated using Elon M money and influence there the ones that stole this election
N7xHQq2xQGw,ACLU is and has been a force to censor and literally stop free speech and CANCLE History for goodness sake
N7xHQq2xQGw,The dems of today are nothing like the dems of old.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Only liars and cheaters want censorship!!
N7xHQq2xQGw,I see the problem. You wanted her to talk. No can do.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I absolutely DO NOT LIKE Joe Rogan. But, I have to say, he is 100% right. If the democrats lives depended on telling the truth, they'd all disappear like a Thanos snap.😮"
N7xHQq2xQGw,Regurgitate perfect word for  what comes out of her mouth
N7xHQq2xQGw,More Conservatives need to become Democrats cuz right mow they are pushing globalism/Socialism. Our republic can not co-exist with that form of Governor ING that dtiffles freedom and domestic tranquility❤.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Well lets tell the truth about the right. Oh wait there r no truths.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Rogan offered her to do the show and she declined. Trump did the show and she changed her mind. He already HAD a guest confirmed and refused to bow down to her ""rules"""
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Ditto! I’ve always been an independent, as I hate being shoved into a box, and that’s that. But I use to lean towards the left. My voting card was a patch work quilt. I picked the person I associated best with, my values, beliefs, no matter their party. Now, I’ve voted straight republican since 2016. Still independent, but the left absolutely isn’t the one of my Father’s Day. Or even my younger years."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Lmao Trump, the former president came. Far outranks a failed VP and still made time to come to Joe 😂 Kamala the 🤡"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Those things the left support are against everything a civilised society stands for in its valuews and standards. One thing I will point out, look at how Hollywood tried to shoot down the Sound of Freedom, and the song about rioting. The progressive are perverse."
N7xHQq2xQGw,It would be AWESOME if we could get grampa Biden on this show. not president Biden but Grampa Biden. i think listening to old ppl stories would be cool! i am pretty close to neutral so i dont care which side is doing what....
N7xHQq2xQGw,The cigar smoke was distracting.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Joe Rogan has more of a following than Kamala. His outreach is more powerful than hers. She has no real personality and that would have shown
N7xHQq2xQGw,Anyone else notice how Kamala wore ONE SPECIFIC set of earrings to almost all of the interviews she ever did????  Wonder what the odds are that those are her only earrings????
N7xHQq2xQGw,"He who isn't A liberal in their youth has no heart and isn't A conservative in old age has no brain. Joe is Older wiser ,richer
And logical."
N7xHQq2xQGw,I am a naturalist a homieopathic meaning I only do the drugs that are found in nature. A pure blood.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Vindman (The Trump whistleblower that tried to get him impeached who is from Ukraine) Won VA district 07. Vindman was asked for a 14-minute interview and would only give the news 7 minutes in which he sat there and lied about his opponent and still won somehow. It was a complete control thing. Vendman can't be trusted. Millions of dollars from outside of the district went towards his campaign and he is an obvious puppet or plant with financial interest in the Ukraine war. He's not from Virginia district 7 and should not represent the district. I don't understand how our country lets things like this happen. He obviously cheated his way in and is there for not the best interests of that district.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Yeah! It’s all changed because the left is showing its true colors!!
N7xHQq2xQGw,"IT TOOK YOU THAT LONG TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY . Joe ,you are better . i was also a Hippy. Now at 72 . I changed from dem to independent i the 80s"
N7xHQq2xQGw,“Have a conversation like a human being” he said to the robot lizard
N7xHQq2xQGw,She would’ve actually had to answer questions. She’s not very good at doing that. Ever.
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I voted for kamala....that's what I told my girlfriend😅.
Let's go 47"
N7xHQq2xQGw,Whats clear is day is what a tool and sellout howard stern is. Funny how karma works
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Rogan speaking to my soul with the shift in the mind of the left. Grew up very conservative but always found myself aligning with what the left was. But now as I watch the internet set fire to their ideology and it shift to this party of pandering that can never actually settle on an ideal world, and just shift goal posts because they don’t know anything else."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Dump truck and kitty litter 2024😅
N7xHQq2xQGw,"The cultural shift is people of the lower classes not going with the programming anymore. We are straying from the ""sociatile norms"" that have turned us into ants mindlessly feeding the queens and instilling a false sense of purpose designed to meet the needs of the privileged few."
N7xHQq2xQGw,the Podcast would have benefited her more than Joe Rogan. As such if she wanted to she would have.
N7xHQq2xQGw,It's time for new improved League of Justice to put the old Democratic political machine in modern histories cracked rear view . Thank Hootie and the Blowfish.. ...
N7xHQq2xQGw,"She's an idiot, thats what happened"
N7xHQq2xQGw,I think every nominee for president and vice president should do a sit down on the JR podcast during every election
N7xHQq2xQGw,Good bye Kamelto Harris!!
N7xHQq2xQGw,Mr. Rogan i would love to sit and have a conversation with you
N7xHQq2xQGw,I cant brlieve it. Colby jack cheese and beer is the shit. Pantera rocks 🎉
N7xHQq2xQGw,BRO  LIARS BLOW SHIT OUT OF PROPOPRTION.....  CAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU  PEOPLE  CANT SIT DOWN AND HAVE A BACK AND FORTH CONVO ......LIKE HONEST GROWN UPS WHO TALK IN FACTS  NOT EXAGGERATED IFS...STOP ACTING LIKE A SPOILED BRAT!!!!
N7xHQq2xQGw,"The whole idea that because Joe Rogan wasn't going to change his platform or location is male privilege is ludicrous, especially when it's Kamala's campaign, not his, she doesn't get to hijack anyone's platform to reach their audience, which she needed.  But every one of us, who have witnessed her word salad being analyzed by mainstream outlets and manipulated into something she never actually said, knows exactly what her campaign manager was trying to do , Edit and censor the content to give a different impression of what actually would have happened.  Good on Joe Rogan for maintaining his platforms integrity!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Joe In this day and age its coping out to say your "" in the middle"" when it comes to politics.
The cavern  between the 2 existing  parties  in america today is so  huge most intelligent people agree with one side or the other. The Democratic party has gone off a cliff compared to just 20 years ago or so. I voted for Kennedy who at that time was considered a very progressive guy. Today he would be considered a conservative!! So no "" middle of the road"" Joe.  ""COME ON MAN""."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Oeople used to have blood test before marriage. This could be part of autism. Many peoples blood doesn't match up. Fft
N7xHQq2xQGw,let it sink in 61 million sheep
N7xHQq2xQGw,if it makes you democrats that voted for trump feel better you didn't vote for a republican you voted for a democrat running under a republican ticket
N7xHQq2xQGw,Staying in the basement seemed to work for Biden. Maybe that's the strategy Kamala should have copied.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Both sides serve the same mo
N7xHQq2xQGw,Joe Rogan for press secretary
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Yea she’s to busy opening up those borders, trying to make America not safe. You know things are bad when local gangs are complaining about gangs taking over from other countries like the Venezuela gangs in Chicago."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Obsessed with the meme @ 0:25
N7xHQq2xQGw,"Trump was invited, as was Vance, Harris, and Walz. Both Republicans showed up and were humble and thanked Joe for the opportunity, as it should be, it’s HIS show. Dems said no thanks, because they want to control the environment of the interview and also look at it like they are giving Joe the chance to have his little show come ask them a couple softball questions, but they can’t be bothered to go to Texas and have an unscripted convo for 3h. Thankfully the adults will be in charge again very soon. Get ready for some big changes. If you work as a federal employee for an agency that isn’t really necessary, start looking for a new job in the private sector, your time livin off my tax dollars and contributing nothing to the GDP are coming to an end. Get to work America. 🇺🇸"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"We did it Joe, we shit in our mess kit! That is all."
N7xHQq2xQGw,Proud Boys aren't extremists. Just saying.
N7xHQq2xQGw,At this point if your still for the lying left. Your to brainwashed and insane. Your a sick person and lying to yourself. Tell me I'm wrong
N7xHQq2xQGw,She wanted a teleprompter!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
N7xHQq2xQGw,i'm right i'm always right even if i'm wrong i'm right if u don't believe me just ask me & i will lie to u again
N7xHQq2xQGw,And this is why the Passage of Time is significant !!!!
N7xHQq2xQGw,How do you get around superbam inc copyright?
N7xHQq2xQGw,"So the same thing they tried with Kai?
complete control and little open discussion"
N7xHQq2xQGw,"""Politically homeless."" Is the best description for being neutral I ever heard. I always considered myself centralized politically, more left leaning. But I flipped way more to the right the last few years. I don't 100% support Trump, but I do agree with some, and enough to support him as a president. I understand that they can't make everyone happy, but neither party would. Kamala would be the wrong decision, she lacks confidence, and she's too emotional to be a leader. You can't lead objectively with emotion."
N7xHQq2xQGw,"HAVE NO FEAR , THE GREAT WHITE HOPE IS BACK!"
N7xHQq2xQGw,It’s so funny ..the main point Joe Rogan was making has been highlighted by most of these comments here…tribal mentality..turning everything into fuel to “support your own team”..bypassing critical and rational thinking..using criticism and condemnation..as well as an obvious  completely biased mentality..throw in childish insults as well. This is what’s truly scary for the future of  country.
N7xHQq2xQGw,Myself as a Canadian I judged the election by the polls and the attendance at the rallies and I expected a landslide for Trump .. This is big for Canada now we have to give Trudeau the boot  and when that happens life is going to be good....
N7xHQq2xQGw,Algorithm
N7xHQq2xQGw,We did it!!!! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
N7xHQq2xQGw,I’m glad the conversation with Kamala didn’t happen. I don’t think Joe can take 3 hours of her talking in word salad.
N7xHQq2xQGw,NO WAY her vice Laziness is going to get on the show!
N7xHQq2xQGw,"I remember when the ACLU defended the right of the notzy group to hold a protest. Not only that, it was in a Jewish neighborhood. They explained their position well enough that I had a mad respect for the organization. It didn't improve my opinion of the notzies at all.

I don't have much respect for the ACLU any more, but still have a profound and growing respect for the Bill of Rights."

u0p_GBWbUIY,"Is it a coincidence that Kamala was trying to promote the debunked message of ""unity"" when Biden said that?  Democrats aren't ""unifiers""...they've been the political party of division since the beginning!"
u0p_GBWbUIY,If only other Republicans would take Trump's lead and not want the press to like them.  The class of 1994 played go along to get along and look at the mess that we're in today.

u0p_GBWbUIY,Trump is coming to clean up the town!!
u0p_GBWbUIY,Its all a plot. The shirts were ready to go next day? No one thinks that's suspicious? Shills.
u0p_GBWbUIY,Trump should actually make jobs that help clean the trash in new york and other citys that needed cleaning.
u0p_GBWbUIY,Kamala's campaign  is floorless - i.e. the bottom has fallen out of it.
u0p_GBWbUIY,One man's trash is another man's treasure.  Guess we're all treasure!
u0p_GBWbUIY,Trump’s just doing side missions now 😂
u0p_GBWbUIY,This is one of the many reasons we love Trump. He’s got a great sense of humor and uses the attacks against him to his advantage. You gotta love a guy that takes an insult and plays into it for laughs.😂

u0p_GBWbUIY,What in the Trumpverse is going on?💀
u0p_GBWbUIY,How dare you not be triggered by this - angy lib noises
u0p_GBWbUIY,"With 50 different State-Democrat Party standards of how a presidential candidate must be chosen, Kamala's appointment by the Uni-Party Deep-State MUST have violated at least one or two standards, making her an illegitimate candidate.  There are at least four States with a great surplus of Party-bylaws, New York, Florida, Illinois, and CALIFORNIA where qualifications have been violated by the NATIONAL Democrat Party.  If she is disqualified in any one of these States, in order to NATIONALLY qualify as President she may consequently utilize no nationally-defined electoral-college votes from that State ... which means that she loses the election."
u0p_GBWbUIY,Dang. You’re running late.
u0p_GBWbUIY,Trump understands MIDDLE CLASS 👍 he’s a real man knowing ALL JOB are important..🇺🇸
u0p_GBWbUIY,"“Kamala Harris has been running a flawless campaign and that’s why she raised billions of dollars.”  No, the multinational corporate-government cabal that owns the MSM script readers and all the D and Rino politicians paid $billions into her campaign to get her to be the most steerable puppet president."
u0p_GBWbUIY,Now he should drive a Trump honey wagon (septic tank pumper) to drain the swamp!!
u0p_GBWbUIY,I think he follows you
u0p_GBWbUIY,"O yeah he done it probably with your donated campaign Money, also I read he spends it on his attorney fees as well !"
u0p_GBWbUIY,this man is on something and I love it
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Dont worry, information strips about ""sudden change in vote counting and win of Kamala Harris"" are ready.
Be ready to being scammed.
Orange men bad!"
u0p_GBWbUIY,"We have to consider that the comment was also targeted to rile up Trump supporters and get them mad. And to do something to play into their hands. So have to give credit to everyone who embraced the term and ran with it. ""If a man compels you to go a mile with him, go two."" lol."
u0p_GBWbUIY,"A hilarious one I saw was a guy taking a selfie with a pile of garbage bags behind him saying, ""Me and the homies going to vote."" lol.

But honestly, the logistics of getting a garbage truck and getting it either painted/wrapped in a day speaks well for the ability of his team. Remember that he can't do this by himself."
u0p_GBWbUIY,The fact that this just happened and trump got a maga garbage truck on standby just proves that he’s ready for shit
u0p_GBWbUIY,I identify as a banana peel! Don't tread on me!
u0p_GBWbUIY,"""Kamala and Joe Biden"" LOL."
u0p_GBWbUIY,He's the nuttiest President and Presidential candidate ever! 😂😂😂😂 He makes lemonade out of lemons like nobody else can. He will make America great again! He will take out the trash. 😎
u0p_GBWbUIY,British maga garbage here 😂 🇬🇧 🇺🇸
u0p_GBWbUIY,Just got a Trump ad before this video
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Someone needs to make a four panel shirt with Trump's : fight fight fight, mug shot, Mcdonald's shot, and garbage shot. I'd buy it.

Maybe on the back his second inauguration photo."

u0p_GBWbUIY,My Man..  My favorite was seeing the garbage cans fly by and you saying Mega garbage voters running to the polls.. Brilliant
u0p_GBWbUIY,Obama advocated for racism.
u0p_GBWbUIY,Being American is a meme now a days
u0p_GBWbUIY,".No freaking way, I love Donald Trump, amazing job, it's a new level of president compain"
u0p_GBWbUIY,Less DEI and more actual qualifications behind our country please.

u0p_GBWbUIY,Forget draining the swamp. It's gonna take too much work. We're just gonna turn it into a TRUMP DUMP!
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Let's face it, we're all trash pandas here"
u0p_GBWbUIY,ONLY DONATIONS I SEE ARE PETO-FILES PAYING TO HOPEFULLY STAY OUT OF PRISON.    HARRISs. Whole Concerts were all P~DIDDLERS very god friends  and HARRIS  AWOLZ  BESTIES.
u0p_GBWbUIY,He's the Sultan of Meme........
u0p_GBWbUIY,The first rule of Donald Trump's campaign: Thou shalt have fun!
u0p_GBWbUIY,"we all know how the left likes to determine the definitions, Just ask a liberal what a girl is and they will tell you it can be anything.  I am happy the left is exercising their right to call trump and his supporters garbage. I really am, it means they still have rights and as long as we don't loose rights then i could care less if trump wins or looses. But the moment the government decides what the definition of hate speech is, that is the moment i no longer see them as democratic. If you cant define a Girl then you cant define hate speech. Im just a normal Democrat by hear. I dont support trump but Im also not completely blind to my parties antics and hypocrisy. No one is without sin and Kamala strikes me as someone who pretends to be a saint and I dont trust someone who doesn't have a dark side."
u0p_GBWbUIY,Great video ✌️😎
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Love him or lump him, the man knows how to lean into the memes and knows how to take a joke. Repect for that."
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Add this truck to the rest of maga gear,a mini replica a long with the coffee mugs etc I, approve of this message"
u0p_GBWbUIY,I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm actually enjoying this election
u0p_GBWbUIY,This may very well be The beginning of The end of network news .
u0p_GBWbUIY,I knew he was going to make murch grift off his stunt
u0p_GBWbUIY,How much of my fellow 'garbage' has voted for Trump already? How much of my fellow 'garbage' intends to?
u0p_GBWbUIY,It was epic!!
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Trump could rent a 10 yard garbage truck, which happens to be small enough that it doesn't require a CDL, and Trump could actually drive said garbage truck."
u0p_GBWbUIY,Trump’s humour and his ability to get stuck in and relate to voters is a great thing
u0p_GBWbUIY,Have to admit. It's funny.
u0p_GBWbUIY,We don't get mad. We get even😅😅
u0p_GBWbUIY,That is awesome! 🤣 I love it! He is such a boss and a genius! So is his campaign manager and staff for helping come up with these ideas that totally flip what liberals say and shove it back in their face with a hefty side of sarcasm. What’s even better is that he just doesn’t care what the media says. It totally deflates their intent to turn people against him and get a rise out of him. That’s the kind of guy I want to be president!
u0p_GBWbUIY,"And thus Trump has learned, the best revenge is making your enemies look utterly stupid."
u0p_GBWbUIY,Blue collar workers like Garbage Men are respectable workers unlike the scamming doctors and lawyers.
u0p_GBWbUIY,Biden - feeble old man. A has been.  Harris - Does not tell the truth. Unable to control the tongue. LOL

Like seriously, he's getting down to us normies' levels for this, unlike Harris and Biden who still treat us like stupid children.
Praying for integrity this election. Its worrisome already hearing stories about voting stuffs..."
u0p_GBWbUIY,I did not think you would have a ”deplorable” moment in this election cycle.

u0p_GBWbUIY,DJT=LEGEND.❤
u0p_GBWbUIY,That garbage truck makes me laugh so hard
u0p_GBWbUIY,I'm proud to be irredeemable deplorable garbage.
u0p_GBWbUIY,"What would be nice, and possibly what would drive the point home to people, is for Trump to make policies so American-friendly as he exits the White House that would show that the Dems are not really wanting to make their policies for the people if they were to be elected 2028."

u0p_GBWbUIY,"""Don't underestimate Joe's ability to f*ck things up."" Barack Obama"
u0p_GBWbUIY,Fight!Fight!Fight!³
u0p_GBWbUIY,It still blows my mind that we live in a time where the president of the United States openly insults half of the country numerous times over. The only reason he feels like he can get away with that is because the entire media apparatus will run cover for him no matter what he does or says.
u0p_GBWbUIY,we need a literal Trump train now
u0p_GBWbUIY,Garbage truck force 1
u0p_GBWbUIY,"It's weird, but for some reason I suddenly remembered this old clip from The Simpsons: https://youtu.be/boAWFriUsMo?si=IgiRKDxlt5sjtee0"

u0p_GBWbUIY,"Does nobody think it’s weird the Biden is still President and he is barely heard from?  
Meanwhile Obama’s mug is out there every day pushing for a fourth term."
u0p_GBWbUIY,"This is an american story. A convicted felon, goes out to work a job he doesnt like and through perserverance he climbs to the highest rank in public office."
u0p_GBWbUIY,DJT is hilarious! 😂 And he is 100% right: Just laugh at them and all their evil attempts to destroy him & to destroy your country. It's not working and nothing angers them more than being laughed at.

u0p_GBWbUIY,"Everything they call us is what they are, but the ones they haven't verbalized and they keep secret are pedophiles and Luciferians."
u0p_GBWbUIY,Abc showed kamala winning Pennsylvania 10 days in advance. They are going to steal the election.
u0p_GBWbUIY,He is a genius !!!!

u0p_GBWbUIY,"Spot on yet again! Thanks for being concise and serving up prime rib instead of word salads (apologies to vegans who may be offended by the analogy, but it was the best mind picture of my point!)"
u0p_GBWbUIY,"I'd much rather have a garbage man that's been convicted of serious crimes, and so on and so fourth. Go Teump and Vance!"
u0p_GBWbUIY,Might just wear a garbage bag when I go vote for Trump and red all the way down the ballot.  🗑
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Trump always finds a way to upset his political opponent and they themself make themself look bad and stupid in return its so funny waht a shit show the ""political"" spectrum of the U.S is."
u0p_GBWbUIY,Don the trash man.....Can he fix it....Don the trash man.....yes he can....
u0p_GBWbUIY,What's so awful about the last several yrs is that Trump is actually a really good person and he's been made out to be a monster to easily swayed idiots!
u0p_GBWbUIY,"Dude i really wanted Trump to be driving it! 
I mean Joe used to drive 19 wheelsers =)"
u0p_GBWbUIY,What would be great if he returned to Joe Rogan as a sitting president during a media briefing.
u0p_GBWbUIY,Love this!!!😂😂😂😂😂
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Thank you for being a supporter of Donald Trump! ❤️🤍💙
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"So pointing out he had affairs equals calling a person ""disgusting animal""? Pray some more, son."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,He is absolutely BRILLIANT!!😂😂😂😂
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Mike, we don’t need you to explain Trumps humor, just play the clips!"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,5:14 ...😱😂😂
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,These People Been Trying to Get Trump With a GOTCHA Moment For Many Years Now Even Trying to KILL Him and EVERY Time He Spins These GOTCHA Moments Around in His Favor
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,A statesman doesn’t talk like that. It’s the side of Trump I dislike. It’s not smart or clever …. it’s disrespectful and low.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Love your show
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump warfare baby 😁
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"The ""because you'd be in jail"", ""because it came from cheyna"" and the comment about being the only candidate not needing people's money are my favorites. https://youtu.be/dl78PQGJpiI?si=gNzoj3_WB3lml860"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"I LOVE his rip on Anthony Wiener , pantomiming Wiener taking a pic of his privates with his phone,sending it and then Trump makes a mocking ,goofy expression 😂"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Unlike Democrats, Trump will be interviewed by anyone because he is fearless."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,He's savage and it's 💯 showmanship 😅
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"For the lefTURD:

Being blunt and brutally honest means you’re a LIAR."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump is just too good…
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,8:55 people saying Trump was doing horrible for the economy😅😂😂😂😂😂 just goes to prove you wrong
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,And this is why they had to make it so he couldn't talk as much
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Love this video🎉🎉
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,You missed the stephanopolous interview.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump speaks straight up and has an Aussie sense of humour 😅❤❤❤❤❤❤
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"The democrats couldn't run a toilet in the outback. 
Love from Australia ❤❤❤"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,His timing is brilliant
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Your laugh makes me laugh.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"You laugh at his 5th grade antics but that is the reason this race is so close where it should be a lanslide against the ignorance and incompetence of the current administration.  None of it is funny, it is a pitiful shame."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Your killing me Michael. Love your show
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I thoroughly enjoyed this! 🤣
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,🙏
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Michael Knowels
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Much thanks for your Videos. Very informative and entertaining too. Good Luck to you and your YouTube channel.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"HEY ROSIE, THAT'S THE MOST PUBLICITY YOU'VE EVER HAD."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Michael, can you find the video clip when Prez Trump said this on the news "" I don't know why Kim Jong Un calls me old, I would never call him short and fat"". Oh ho ho, I went towork that day wearing a ear to ear smile on my face. 
TRUMP & VANCE MAGA 2024 & BEYOND."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Lol
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I absolutely love Trump! One of my favorite times was when he was running against Hillary and she was complaining how he doesn't pay enough tax. He put it right back on her and said why haven't you fixed the tax codes then? Because you benefit from it and so do all your donors. That's why.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Great just great thanks trump 2024 love trump ❤❤❤❤
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"As much as I enjoyed this, it made me realise how much worse Kamala is as a presidential candidate! At least Hillary (even though I absolutely despise them Clintons) could frame a proper meaningful sentence."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,My favorite comeback! Cause you’d be in jail. I still laugh at that. I truly can’t stand that woman.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Nuclear codes ?   Imagine if she had the codes on election night 2016 when everything caved in on her, throwing a crying tantrum, throwing anything she could get her hands on, cussing like a sailor at everyone who dared to stick around.  I think God there was not a box with a button with a code keys for her to punch to set off Armageddon on us all.  Dont talk to me about nuclear codes."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"I truly enjoy your show. I'll remember this day in 2024 watching you laugh at previous president trump's zingers thinking to myself, ""wow, that's when I knew Michael would run for office."" You just look like you are having so much fun and you have a sense of duty and passion for what is right and common sense. I think you would be a great candidate one day."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,What part of what he said about Rosie O'Donnell isn't true?
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,His hair has improved though.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,The glaze is crazy
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,He should’ve included Whoopi too!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,04:00 Did you catch the wry smile on Dr. Rand Paul's face after Trump's comeback?  He's a real one also😎
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Rand Paul almost laughed.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Another great one is when Hillary is attacking him for not paying taxes and he just owns it and starts name dropping her donors who do the same thing 😂😂
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,We love Trump 🙏🇺🇲🙏
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Your reactions to these are exactly what lots of us feel, making this absolutely enjoyable!! PLEASE keep these coming."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Great video 😂
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Candidate Trump telling the hildabeast she'd be in jail is the single greatest moment in U.S. presidential debate history. There is nothing that comes close. Even Ronald Reagan's 1984 takedown of Mondale's age comment doesn't rise to the occasion. It was likely the greatest political moment we'll ever see. Keep in mind, I was both a hildabeast HATER and close to being a never-Trumper at the time. I loathed Donald Trump, and I didn't vote for him even though I hate the hildabeast more than any political figure who has ever lived. I bought the media's hype about Trump. Now that I've seen how he governs, I love him."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump rocks!❤
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Incredible politician and president
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"“Maybe it’s because the US has a better President”.

FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I love Trump. He is not a politician.  He is a doer.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Michael, you don’t need to include the inserts."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,That was refreshing funny needed good laugh these days he’s something thank you for that God Bless
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"⭐️🇺🇲⭐️  THANK YOU, MICHAEL. EXCELLENT."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"RE: Rosie.
Did you SEE HIS FACE, HIS EYES, THE BEGINNING OF A SMILE as he knew what his comeback would be????
We didn't know to pay such sharp attention  the first time we saw it. HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO WAIT for the end of the question.  Just pre-empted it on his time schedule.
( many felt sorry for rosie.  And not without cause.  Sadly, in many ways she seems to be unyieldingly bitter.)"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,9:15 more of this please
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,He smoked Hillary 🤣 I love his humor!!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I love my fucking president!! 😂❤🎉
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Whoever edited this needs to move on from SpongeBob. It’s not 2005 and you’re not 11. Sorry not sorry.

On the other hand, “I can’t believe you’ve done this” will probably never get old to me."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"The ""I know you're not thinking you never do."" and the ""You'd be in jail."" are my two favorites lol hes very smart and has a good sense of humor thats why alot of people dont like him but he is 100% who we need back in office. Trump 2024"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump has taken alot for our country from Democrat when he don't have to. He loves our country and people
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I hated him so much that I didn't vote for him the first time in 2016.... but my God! I changed my voter status from independent to Rebulican for 2020 and I'm raging for him in 2024!!!!!❤❤❤❤
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,TRUMP 2024 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Ive watched this so many times...always a good go to for me
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Donald Trump is America.  And 2nd.  Is hank Williams Jr.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Hate to break it to Rosie, but she's not a moral compass either."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,And he is still getting the common folk at home…. The nay difference is this time he has experience to back him up.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,😂😂😂 Donald Trump is hilarious.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Thanks for the President Trump 's zinger reviews. You made me laugh 😅
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,STOP ALL THE GOD DAMN YAPPING IN BETWEEN NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR IT NO WONDER WHY FOR EACH SEGMENT ITS MOST REPLAYED BECAUSE ALL YOU SPEAK IS YAPPANESE

FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I never could understand why some people disliked Donald Trump.  He is just so  ... genuine.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Truth Really Upsets Most People. TRUMP
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"2016 debate insults.  Almost everyone of those people EXCEPT Jeb Bush support Trump and many are very close.  The Bush's still resent how Jeb was treated.  But then again, per Judge Joe Brown, Obama was very close to the Bush's, in fact, he was brought up with George Jr.  And Obama's stepfather and mother were CIA operatives while George Sr. was the director of the CIA.   Hmmm."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I love it

FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Seriously? Calling out a multi-time cheater is “starting it?” so me as the scorned ex-wife of my cheating and gutless ex-husband who didn’t want to take care of his ailing child or love his wife who verbalized my disdain for him leaving me for another person to give up his daily family responsibilities and vows to me is ME BEING IN THE WRONG? Hahahaha…..you narcissistic folks are sad.

FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Donald Trump lied about putting Crooked Hillary behind bars. I hope he is not lying about a massive deportation program? If he is, America is f&%ked!"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Donald Trump is an asshole for not putting Hillary behind bars. He promised us he would and he did not keep his promise. Democrats keep parroting “ No one is above the law.” But they keep breaking the law and keep getting away with it. I am starting to believe that  Donald Trump is secretly part of The Deep State, because he will not put a Democrat away. It is not revenge. People need to be held accountable, and they are not. America deserves everything they get! A person once said “ If GOD does not punish America, he will owe Sodom and Gomorrah an apology."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Secret service is laughing
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Great job, Michael! You have me laughing out loud! LOVE my DJT!!!!"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,4:04 I love how Rand Paul just smiles when he gets roasted. Such a great response
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,AFTER ALL….THE PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE “COMMANDER IN CHIEF” AND THESE WERE HIS MILITARY WHO HAD BEEN KILLED.  ENOUGH SAID.  GOD BLESS THEIR FORMER “COMMANDER IN CHIEF” WHO RESPECTED THESE FAMILIES ENOUGH TO SHOW UP!!!!!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump needs a drummer following him around to do rim shots.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Humor is why little Americans like Trump. My kids love watching his savage moments compilations. Honestly I feel the same way. Many in my circle hate that about him but that’s why I love him. It’s a great reminder that he’s not establishment. Antiestablishment is what we’ve needed for a long time. Trump 2024!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"This is my first time watching your channel, I do believe.  Enjoyed it a lot 👏🏻🥰‼️"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Your Rand Paul impersonation sounded just like Bill Clinton 🤣😂!  I guess they sound similar.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,HONORABLE PRESIDENT TRUMP I LOVE YOU
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"I love his dance! I have a video that when I'm having a bad morning, I just watch it and it makes my day 😂😂"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,One of my favorites!!!!!❤️💝🙏🇺🇸✝️
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Love DJT !!!!
He’s not afraid to tell it like it is 
DJT/JDV 2024
MAGA !! ❤️🇺🇸❤️"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Ohh yes BECAUSE you'd be in jail,, to Hillary,  still looking forward to that by the way"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"..oh no..he comments on peoples looks   I seem to remember  one example ,, ""orange man""  bad   and jokes about his hair   but..did we hear anything about bidens Hair Plugs? Nope  and they're still attacking him,,,   talk about kindergarten"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"The "" only Rosie O'Donnell"" one is my Favorite"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"No president in the history of politics has gathered the support following and admiration like Trump has.. he says it as he sees it.. tired of lying BS politicians around the world... Governments steal enough money from us as it is, so why not have a president who stands up for the people and says it as it is.. like a normal person.. f... being presidential nonsense!"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,LOVE LOVE LOVE TRUMP❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Love love this vid ❤ Thanks Michael for the reminder.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,You are so good with your brilliant comments!! Go Trump!!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump 2024🇺🇸🇮🇱
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Notice how the media and moderators try to keep him from saying anything that the audience applauds him for. They even warn the audience not to respond.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump is the everyman. He's like you and me.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I love love his sense of humor he rocks 😂❤❤❤❤
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Pelosi questioned Trump why was Congress was not informed of the killing of a Middle East terrorist beforehand , He replied Washington could not keep a secret !"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"“That’s ok, I know you’re not thinking. You never do…go ahead..” 😭😭😭 I was trying not to laugh, but I’m choking."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Fantastic impressions. Trump all the way!  Kamaltoe? Duuuuuuhmb.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,4 WOW?
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Rand is intelligent and good looking and he half smiled at DJT’s jab.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,That was awesome
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Rosie O’Donnell has always been lying scum. There weren’t ever any rumors about him cheating on Marla Maples. In fact, the rumor was she cheated on him with her bodyguard."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,He needs to be back in
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Please this slob has nothing
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Love ❤️ President Trump
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,2:20 from what movie is this?
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,That was great. With one word he can get his point across. I love his sense of humor!❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,😂😅😊
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Just think how many voters he got with the “only Rosie O’Donnell” thing because everyone hates Rosie O’Donnell.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Only rosie o’pigface
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Hope he does it this time, It's Obvious Hillary belongs in jail along with her husband"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Great show
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Years of trying to frazzle Trump and Democrats still don’t comprehend Trump Psychology 101. The man is a Manhattan real estate developer and media star. He is wired for combativeness. He flourishes under a sustained barrage of attacks that would break others, because that’s his lived experience."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Democrats often say ""we take Donald Trump at his word"" when he says shocking stuff.  They secretly know that it is part of his ""shtick"" but they just can't compete with his brand of humor."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I grew up in lower New York and was always a fan! I watched every episode of The Apprentice. He was always fun on The Howard Stern Show before Stern met Beth and started hanging out with libitards in the Hamptons. I also bought a book that has his tweets and it’s hilarious. I didn’t have Twitter at the time
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,He do what he say.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,So agree he he
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I LOVE DONALD TRUMP HES THE BEST.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Rand Paul was stifling a laugh.  He knows his hair is funny.   Make America Funny Again.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"I remember, when music groups and performers would not be affiliated with Trump, and he turned around and made it about us, he made it about the military, the vets, working women, Black people/colleges, jail reform !!! 
He has always focused on the working class, people, the policeman, the military, firefighters, everybody !"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Good Luck President Trump and *Welcome back 🔙 in The USSR! !!! LENINS IDEAS 💡 WINS PEOPLE'S WORLD'S WIN DEMOCRACY & REPUBLIC People's OF THE WORLD!!!*
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Hi! Mr. Don *& You're Team !!! We help You in The World &* made Now New USSR President !!! *Children's 👪 need Peace in WORLD'S !!!* Well *President The 🗽 USA Kamala!* We help!!! *Generations Freedom USA People's republic & democratic back 🔙 in The future is USSR Best Stability control Country in The WORLD!!!*

FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Gotta agree w the Rosie O'Donnell
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Funny stuff
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"As a woman, I think he’s absolutely the greatest! 
Trump 2024 🇺🇸"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Trumps roast of Hillary was BRUTAL!  Many have forgotten about that one, but it is legendary."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"I love the mamaluke reference, Michael"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"I laughed SO hard when Trump said ""Only Rosie O'Donnell.""  I almost couldn't breathe for about a minute I was laughing so hard at that.
I think I decided to support him right at that moment.  Never have looked back."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Love Trump
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Great ending
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,President Bonespurs
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"The democrats first tried to destroy him in 2016 only by the statement that he was not a politician, they failed, they tried to Charges him with Russia influence, they failed, they tried to destroy him this week in Arlington, they failed!!!"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"He is a freaking lion, not a liar"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,It’s was easy after Jeb after that it was just like booking the mid 80s NWA Ric Flair
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Problem: The leftist media will take Trump’s words out of context and make them a shocking point (eg, “bloodbath”)."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trumps amazing and loves his country. He's witty as hell. I do love that about him. 😂
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"My favorite two are ""You'd be in jail"" (hopefully soon!), and ""Hillary said pardon me..."". LOFL The thing I love most about President Trump is he talks like a human being. I worked in Highway construction for 45 years and talk just like him!"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,He's called hit ler anyway
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"..and yes, she Should be in jail! 😂"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Thank you Michael Knowles!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,I love him!!!  Too dang funny!!!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"My God, love him, hate him or indifferent to him, he’s hilarious, soo funny!"
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,We really need neutral reporters who report what Americans really want to know! Now a days all the media just covers trump being a racist and how he hurt someone's feelings!!!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump is sharp as a tack.  But he is brutally honest.
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,The more I watch DT walking around and talking like he does with out any fear of pushback from anyone.. I swear he reminds me of one of those top  Mafia guys who just go about with what ever he wants to do
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Trump is just highly intelligent that is how he gets those come backs
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Hillary was taken into custody on 9/11/16 AND WE ALL SAW IT
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Awesome video...... Trump is a beast... Trump/Vance 2024
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Mayflower cigars are excellent!
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,"Thank God daily wire has a Jesus loving, president Trump liking person on the team. If they didn't, I wouldn't watch."
FQ4CDQ-S7g4,Need to make more of these videos. They are awesome. Rock on Michael!!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,How can a judge hate you or like you
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Did Bill Clinton put that $700,000 down when he hush money with that girl he was with"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,That's a damn shame they should take that view off of TV
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"$454 million is insane
%175 million is obscene"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I agree. Once this is over president Trump should remove all of his businesses out of New York City. Leticia James is a disgrace to what it means to be an American.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"The View has to
Be the lowest form of life"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Nipples EngMoron
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"lol @ ""You Know Who"". Guess Trump is comparable to Lord Voldemort 🤣"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"I’m just saying that the justice system in USA is horribly corrupt and broken. However our prime minister is the most corrupt and devious PM that Canadians have ever had, the Carbon Tax that he has brought is bankrupting our country. He has given millions of dollars to his family’s slush fund and billions to offshore corporations. He should have been charged with several crimes for not going through parliament to borrow money and just had the deputy prime minister do it for him. The Lavalin corporation has been so corrupt for years and he just let them off but gave them more money.people are losing their houses and their savings and the immigrants we have brought in from Gaza and mostly men with no children ( why) we see and  hear them wanting us to be more like them and if they don’t like it they should get sent back to their own country"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,He didn't win the appeal. That hasn't even happened yet. He got his bond reduced.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Can we please stop calling them“the ladies of the View “?
They are not ladies… they’re idiots 😂😂"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Dude he still has to pay 464 million judgements! 175 million is just an upfront payment! You guys love your orange Jesus 😁
EJSbUkYM8Ig,trump didn't win the appeal. All he did was get a reduction in teh bond so that he can then appeal. he will lose and have to pay $450 million.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I don’t understand why the View women are even relevant.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Im a Trump fan from south africa, but I think he should put a filter in front of his mouth to prevent scaring of people still sitting on the fence.
The dems are trying to destroy him and that is criminal. Who still watches Woopi?"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Anti Trump legal actions are simply political harassment, the typical actions of a dictatorship or a totalitarian regime."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"L James,  Braggs, the Gypsy Cab Driver Judge, and Carol have Destroyed NYC to a level it will never come back.  People are moving out in the thousands with their businesses and guess what? No investers would even touch NY.  Governor amd Mayor self explanitory!  Perhaps the illegal immagrants will tale it over!     You can all thank the Biden Administration."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,What BULL SHYT any normal person would have to put up the whole bond! This piece of shyt trator gets special treatment
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Who the hell even watches the View?  The most garbage show on TV.  Ratings gone down for years.  Whoppie has to be the most racist and discrinating woman on there .
Yikes lmas😂😮😅😅"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,TRUMP IS A SNAKE IN THE GRASS AND A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Oprah has become pathetic and sad
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Do these people realize how disgusting they are? Dispicable people.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Lateisha James is Doctor Bill Cosby With a Hair Weave!!!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Corruption
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"How anyone that isnt brain dead or etarded, still watching ""The View"" is beyond me......"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Well thr bond should be fkn ZERO to begin with.....but hey... ine step at a time when dealing with corruption.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Not a win, the whole thing was a sham. WHY is he putting up with this? He did nothing wrong. However, I think he is just another part of the controlled opposition. People believe he is the second coming, I do not. He corrected surface problems when he was POTUS, but left the rotting infrastructure alone. Didn't he appoint Wray as head of the FBI? Brought in Faucci? Barr? Kept too many agencies alive such as Dept of Ed, EPA. Powell at the Fed. Allowed Google, FB to continue to censor? Left military personnel policy unchanged since obama? And much, much more."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump shouldn’t have to pay a dime. This is complete BS.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Um -  the title of this post is BS.  He didnt win the appeal. He got the bond reduced.  It is now going to the appellate division.    Cant wait till he has to pony up the rest money when he loses.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"There should be no bond. This is not a crime and is a common technique used by ALL realtors. This means, they have just set a precedent. Now, they MUST go after every single realtor in the country."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,150mil for doing nothing this is stupid
EJSbUkYM8Ig,These woman are nothing less then evil!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,It’s god’s way of saying FJB.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,You people make me sick Trump will be just a memory after 2024 election
EJSbUkYM8Ig,TRUMP 2024🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Sunny the slave owner has something to say!
Go figure!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Now, wait until Trump loses the trial before the Appellate Court. He will explode in anger and, by means of his thought slaves, like Megyn Kelly, use it for election purposes. He just bought US$175 million worth of media propaganda. If he wins or loses the Appeal, it does not matter, Trump has been put in a win-win position by the cowed people on the court. And none of this was his own doing. His incompetence and lies about his wealth was rewarded!!! This is how DJT has been living his life, just taking taking taking, never giving anything, and still all comes towards him. For the life of me, I cannot conceive of any advantage anyone would get from a second Trump Administration except another trillion-dollar dole out to millionaires and billionaires like in December 2017."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,They are constantly rewriting the rules
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Blatant electoral tampering….
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Whoopi Goldberg is such a clown and the oldest child I've ever seen she's downright infantile, she hasn't been funny since jumping jack flash, and that was October 10th 1986"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Is bond not a process to ensure that the accused does not flee and shows up to  court? The man is running for president there is no flight risk a 1$ bond would be sufficient. It seems to me that the exorbitant bond is a political strategy. The law  is not about politics. it's about justice I think  in a just world the NY bar association would be investigating all justices and prosecutors in this case for ethics violations.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Let's stop calling leftists Liberals, they are precisely the opposite."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I thought you only had to pay 10% of your bond..
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Its Trump today, all Americans would be next and you can't do anything about it."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Clear admission by the leftist judge that the ridiculous fine never had legitimacy.
Throwing out the non-case with zero demand for money with menaces would have been honest, but now the Loony Left have a situation where the gullible will think only 150M doesn't sound too bad. IT IS STILL MONSTROUS"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,enjoy your watermelon hun
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Tish couldnt seize a Bucket of KFC
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump was right again! We're getting tired of all this winning! MAGA 2024💥
EJSbUkYM8Ig,What I thought was extremely interesting  was former President Trump stated  the amount discussed to negotiate   an out of court settlement  was nowhere near the 454 million dollar figure.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Letitia was so sure she was going to seized his assets...and now her biles might be about to explode!🤣😂
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"If the Democrats had merely run an ordinary campaign, presenting and comparing their policies with those of President Trump, they wouldn't be seeing these results in the polls. Instead, they chose to engage an exercise of total annihilation of a political adversary, whom they had previously defeated, thus they may have committed a political kamikaze attack on their own chances."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Interesting how Mz. Johnson cannot bring herself to say President Trump's name, but has no problem saying Hitler's, especially when she's comparing the two men, and favoring Hitler."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump loss of 2020 election because he could not keep his mouth shut?😢
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Dis information.... when did he win the appeal. You are a lawyer...
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Disgusting justice system! Regular citizens don't get that kind of privilege, while Mr. insurrectionists has been committing crimes for decades, and he's still free and able to run for president and now even gets a reduction of his bond. Absolutely disgusting!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Had Trump’s buildings been seized the optics would be so powerful that his popularity and poll numbers would go through the roof.  Then the heifers on the View would ignore that fact, because they assume the election will be fixed to give our mail order president 4 more years.  Total delusion from the lowest form of intelligence on television."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Peeps at the View are annoying as hell
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I feel the demorats will find a way to win this Nov 😢
EJSbUkYM8Ig,America stands with Trump... AND Candace!! 💯💪🇺🇲😘
EJSbUkYM8Ig,They have persecuted Trump politically NON STOP since the escalador !! It’s for no reason either.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Funny how they are trying to prosecute Trump on anything they can think of  and here in California they would not tried hunter biden the taxe charges .     Double standarts?
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump 2026
EJSbUkYM8Ig,The women on the Veiw are evil.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,bill clinton got a second term when the republicans went after him for the land deal in Arkansas and Monika lewinski
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Oh no, I have friends and family who agree with the $450 million.  The people who hate Trump haven’t stopped, they probably never will. If we want Trump instead of Biden we’ll all need to show up in November."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Court Has No basis for $450 nor $175 million.!!!!!
.
Crazy.!!!!
.
😩😩
."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump should not pay any dollar amount he should pay nothing to the new york corrupted goverment its what they do they also did it to micheal jackson to steal all the money from him their evil vandictive monsters and set people up on a daily basis all those destroyed lives because of their greedyness the view are just gossipers of america their actually a comedy show they judge people the view host should be judged and investigated you can see their demonic personality😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"NATIONS - MY Father is judging the nation's with tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, so make sure you get you some flood insurance before you die.  PARABLE 😅"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,malistius procution.  trump 2024 . then put all these croked people in jail.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,the View clip is just crazy. clueless liberals leading their sheep herd to slaughter....and not a single one of them realize it
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Talk about Candace instead.  Mr. Knowles values his paycheck over his friendship.  A weasel.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Harvard law professor Tribe's comments show the extent to which DJT has confused & disoriented the left:  Defund the police; open borders - sanctuarty cities; sex-changes for minors (w/o parental knowledge); J6 insurrection. These ppl are crazy😂😂😂
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"should be Zero amount, as no crime/lost was done, the opposite Banks made money and yes Mr.Trump should remove all his business from NY. NY let Criminals go free, yet they try to destroy a former President who made NY what it was. shame on NY letting this happening."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"As a plaintiff in many suits who has had more losses than wins in the first round before the appeal I can say without a doubt that this massive appeal bond reduction and delay of the trial is a break that nobody else has ever gotten.  So congratulations, your MAGAt King has somehow corrupted the judicial system in his favor.  Now any claims that he's being picked on are as obvious as the thousands of other lies he's telling.  He's still going to lose the election but at least you morons can't claim ""persecution"" anymore.  Enjoy it while it lasts."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Love ya Trump!!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Tribe is competing with Olbermann now
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Its complete bs,,  the cackling geese on the view are pathetic"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,No Weapon formed against Donald Trump will prosper..God please let your angels who excel in strength  encamp around Donald Trump..
EJSbUkYM8Ig,THE DEMOCRATS ARE PANICKING..
EJSbUkYM8Ig,go Trump go
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Haters gonna hate, TRUMP ALL THE WAY 2024!!!!!!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Whether you like Trump or hate him, one thing is sure that Trump can fight, and he never gives up.  With the American political   Left today pushing so hard their crazy ideas,  I can not see anyone other than Trump can push back and win against the Left crazies.  I like DeSantis or Nikki, but I doubt they can withstand against the crazy Left today.  Remember, you don't have to like the guy if he can get things done!!  Go, Dirty Harry!!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Raskin is saying he's working on legislation with moderate republicans to ban him from ballots by july. I think that's gonna be their next play. Because the supreme court said it's their ball
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Letitia James should be behind bars.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Did you see the face on whoopie? What the fuck was Ted Danson thinking? He must have had a mental illness at the time. Then she fucked him over in the divorce.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Isn't there a no-bond policy in NY anyway? 🤔
Oh, only for murder and serious violence! Yeah, makes sense 🌈🤡"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,What people like idiots on The View don't understand about the reduction in Judge Engeron's assigned bond is an indication of that court determining that the judgement was not just. They will hear an appeal unlike Engeron who made a decision on guilt before hearing one witness. There will be 8th Amendment arguments of excessive fines and other 5th and 14th Amendment Constitutional arguments which includes due process and takings.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Why Megyn who is obviously a feminist plays up Trump.  He nearly destroyed her or tried.  Baffles me.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,It is so amusing to watch all these lefties who think they are so smart while everyone is laughing behind their backs at how dumb they are.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Megyn said the magic word  that sums up the left/Democrats in this country today..That word is RESENTMENT.  They are like little Middle School girls who are jeolous of the cute little girl who gets all the attention from the boys.  They try to destroy her with pettiness.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Karma will catch up with this woman
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Lebron James and Leiticia James should have a baby
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Well they do have a two tier system and the right never get it. If the Hunter Biden bullshit was a Trump son, he would already be at Gitmo.  Unfkingbelievable."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Oh and Whoopi is a trash human as well.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump can serve as President for another 6 years. 4 + 1 day as VP. Then 2 years as Acting President. Then finish up as VP
EJSbUkYM8Ig,This will cost NY more than anyone can imagine
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Most  judges are perverts  
Ask  cynthia Payne 
They are the last  people  to 
Criticised him  trump 2024"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"There is far too much hate and bias in the USA justice system under Biden, it is sad to see over here in the UK"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,There  is  no  fraud  case
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Harvard professor  as  no commonn sense  ..  probaly  a communist
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Australian here, absolutely disgusting the American legal system. So corrupt, personal bias, unbelievably scary.. Americans should be afraid, they can do it to you too. ,i can only hope Trump gets in and deals with the problem with the legal system that has zero integrity"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Socialism is the gospel of envy & the greed of ignorance 👍
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"What is hard to understand .... "" it "" got in fraudulently her master's got her in..... The about these "" America haters "" / "" Freedom haters "" like slave and that so called judge...... They all have bosses ..... There is always someone above them and they are the ones that can stop it or slow it down and they are not...... Who's not a higher Court to tell the judge or to appoint a real judge.... I'm not a lawyer but it seems like there's people higher up can stop a lot of these communist Acts ."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Hi Megyn.  Good morning. Where the Hell is Heather Hiscox? I noticed she takes a lot more time off than you do. You even broadcast when you're on vacation.  I've only seen a Baltimore Oriole 3 or 4 times. None of which were on a bridge 🌉.  ...P.S.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Like our poor DIESEL!!  The EVILS have no idea what is in store for them!!    Love always Kelli
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Yup
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"The nyc social climber should be staring at prison walls. As for ""the view""... I can't believe anyone can watch that show without throwing up from the assault on common sense, moral values and sanity."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Sunny comes from a long line of folk who like things in chains.   Her whole family history was built upon it.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Still $175M?  Who in the world can pay this amount. Normal American citizens would be crushed by these radical Democrats. Remember Donald Trump said, “they’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you, I’m just in the way”. Voting Biden?  Might as well Bend over and give all your money to his son Hunter because Biden is a communist."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Can you imagine if MrTrump sells all his property and then moves out of NYC?.....
Guess what will happen?... Who would they blame? ....
NYC is now a  no-go zone for new businesses thank for James an engoron?...
Corrupt Democraps has destroyed America and the people of America way of life....."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Anyone else notice  that Lady Justice in 2024 no longer has a blind fold on and is wearing a I hate conservatives T-Shirt.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I agree with Churchill-----   These women are detestable and vicious-----I am an American living abroad and I am shocked by the deplorable unjust judgements against Donald Trump---one of our very best presidents---
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"That is just an absolute abuse of authority! Enough of the power trip and trying to get what others have because they have worked hard for it. 

They are trying to make an ‘example’ of Trump. Once this is done, how fast do you think they can get assets of middle class???

They want us to own nothing and them controlling everything!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"The fact he is having to post a bond at all is a disgrace to our system. Imagine a AG charging you of crimes that they have no evidence of a crime being committed, or that anyone was hurt in any way. Then it gets magically assigned to a creepy judge that is a disgrace to all judges around the country. After all of that the defendant doesn't even get a trial by jury and the judge gets to throw any number he can think of as a bond!? This is criminal! This is our great justice system at its finest. To think we pay their salaries, and they live a lavish existence while our border gets flooded, and our own American citizens get thrown to the streets."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Of course the democrats are panicking because they know they will be investigated for all the fraud that they themselves have committed.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Who watches the View????!!!!😢😮😅
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Megyn, I lover your show, always informative and interesting, you're the greatest!!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Tribe was a respected constitutional law prof, now he’s a buffoon 😅"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,This is funny AF. Libs are BIG MAD 😅😅😅. Slapped EngMoron but good!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Never did find Whoopi Goldberg funny as an actress.. maybe she never had much British unique humor.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,NYC Court System and AG are disgusting and corrupt to the core. I'm a New Yorker and I'm disgusted! Thanks Kelly and Michael.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,This is bullshit. Any other regular middle class to the working poor American citizen don't receive any special treatment from the courts. Why does the rich?
EJSbUkYM8Ig,F all this leftist
EJSbUkYM8Ig,If this judge can't keep his mouth shut about his bias against a defendant he must recuse himself.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Let’s GO! Trump 2024
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Democrats seem to have cornered the market on Hate Speach. 😮😮😮
EJSbUkYM8Ig,If Trump becomes President again will he have the last laugh ?
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"The judge is turning it into a show trial. He is allowing the Hollywood Access tape in as evidence which has nothing whatsoever to do with this case at all. He is allowing the playboy model to testify who has nothing whatsoever to do with this case at all. She was never paid a dime by Trump. They are having Stormy Daniels testify which has little to nothing to do with issues of this case. They just want these women on the stand under oath to say they had an affair with Trump. The other problem is Bragg wants to claim he violated campaign finance laws which is under federal law and Trump was never charged nor convicted of such a crime. How does a State prosecutor convict anyone of violating federal law when they have no jurisdiction over federal law? Yet the corrupt Trump hating judge is allowing it. They know even if they get lucky to get a conviction it will be overturned, but they don't care because they know that won't happen until after the election. They think if they can get a conviction that will hurt Trump by people changing their mind to not vote him. It is the exact opposite. It will only make them vote for him no matter what and it will win over more voters that would not have voted for him. They are only helping Trump get elected and by the biggest landslide victory in history."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Is there anyone in the history of our country who has gotten better preferential treatment that The Big Guy and his bagmen, Hunter and Jim Biden? And is there any bigger douchebag than Whoopie Goldberg? Seriously. What in the world did Ted Danzon have in mind???"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Sonny are they the same chains that your family used on your slaves?
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I don't like Megan. She makes commercial and you have to listen to it. I don't like what you can or cannot view. I tried to find the delete button but I was forced to listen to her.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"That show with those nagging hosts ""the view"" needs to be cancelled! I'm not even an American or live there, but that show makes me sick!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Its disgusting how much glee these leftists have in others demise!  That judgement was ridiculous!  So, people still want this lefty govt for 4 more years, by then the USA will be a 3rd world country, imagine the homelessness and hopelessness to come!!!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,It’s still too much!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,NY has gone Full On Communism 😠
EJSbUkYM8Ig,The statement from the most committed anti trumper in the world shows how delusional & corrupted these idiots actually are 😑🤡🤦‍♂️
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Whoppi, the woman who admitted to abandoning her child for the sake of fame.
Fact check me.
Her clip saying this is on YouTube. Disgusting human to abandon your own child for the attention of stangers."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,What is her problem.. New York drained from all the illegals they gotta go after him LMAO
EJSbUkYM8Ig,finally one of the reasons I don’t listen to shows like this on both sides is there’s no objective reporting everybody has a slat and if you are then don’t call yourself a reporter and just give them information and yes I have opinions but if I’m just reporting the information I’m reporting the information you clown whatever amount he was asked to pay but what were other people who are not rich asked to pay and the bond was not out of line as Erick Trump claims when she submits the AG three or four others who would pay 2 to 3 times to the amount if you didn’t have the money just say you don’t have the money if you want to appeal it because you can’t afford it I get thatbut quit saying that this fool is treated different than anybody else he is it’s called preferential it’s called privilege it’s called power. It’s called America and what it’s always been.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,The women on the View show are reprehensible. Their souls are not going to the right place when they die.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Some words come to mind:
...Who is John Galt?...."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Keep looking at 40 Wall Street LJ. I've never seen a more smug misdemeanor on a persons face when talking about ""bringing someone down."" Evil at it's finest. How does this sit with your soul? The View doesn't consider all the middle class people who would lose their jobs. A very narrow View indeed by five women of wealth not considering the optics of their biased view and callousness towards average working people."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"So, the court violated the 8th amendment rights ?"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"and I’m gonna throw up the next time I hear the word unprecedented. The behavior of this individual is unprecedented. If you assign all these loaded American values to the position of president I believe certain positions have inherent behaviors if you’re a cop, if you’re a judge if you’re a teacher, if you’re a priest, there’s expert if your father expectations in transit to those positions, and if you don’t want to fulfill those intrinsic behavior moral norms don’t take the damn position get another job thought the apprentice was OK, but it was laughable entertainment like all entertainment is it didn’t affect my life, but when he does things that affect my life, my children’s lives, my neighbors lives we’re allowed to judge and not l Liking when he was on the apprentice, all I need to do was turn the channel and then you had the gall he. They laughed at him. This idiot laughs at people calls people names, insults, veterans insults. Women has the worst haircut in history is fine as hell yet he insults handicap and other people and his cult thinks it’s funny he’s saying what we wanted to say OK well, when someone calls their fat child, they disabled child names their child who died or got catchers in war losers I want to see the same amount applause😢"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,You know Letitia James “ EXPLODED!!! “ when the bond was lowered
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I can hear the heads exploding at MSNBC...again.  🤣😂
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Liberalism is a serious mental disorder ! 😂
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"also, on both size, I love how each is the final arbiter of what’s American what’s right and wrong the laws that you write down are supposed to be that and America has a history of bias laws, a history of unfair laws, whether it retains to slavery women’s rights red liningetc. on the books written laws and I didn’t see Megan Kelly in those cause they get no click bait I didn’t see conservative Christian values pissed off at those because it benefited them"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,The Sick-0 View ….where all the lady losers are seen ! 😂
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"you, Trump cultus are hilarious to me. You believe Rich Whiteman are treated the same as poor white men let alone minorities is laughable. If everyone is such a law and order person, if the law states whatever New York State says, he should be bound to that law, right or wrong if wrong change the law, don’t cry unfair only when it happens to coat leaders. I laugh. Also when people say he’s got 91 convictions my response to that is is crap. Anytime you commit a crime I rob the bank the police do not just charge you with a singular act of robbing the bank I’m sure there’s a hospice charge in there. There’s a caring a weapon in there there’s a Speedy, when you left charge in there there’s 20 other charges they get attitude your charge so if he got caught for lying, let me see it’s hard to discern the difference between 10,000 ft.² and 30,000 ft.² and he draws a chin to himself, by becoming a public figure a real public figure nobody out of New York, knew who Trump was if he draws that political attention to himself, he deserves what he gets but hypocrisy of these shows is the law is blind. If it applies to all people show me one other person, not named Trump, who was found guilty. However, he came with the total and wasn’t forced required to pay whatever the bond was that was allowed to go renegotiated down whether you believe it right or wrong is irrelevant and I’m sure someone’s gonna call me a Trump hater I don’t like him, but my point is the hypocrisy of if it happens to one and doesn’t happen to others that it’s just people chasing but hey we’ll see 2024 November is around the corner. America deserves what it gets if you reelected him"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Why is there not a change of venue in all these cases
EJSbUkYM8Ig,How much was bond for Bernie Madoff?
EJSbUkYM8Ig,God will judge.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I can't wait for the next episode of the view and fat cows next press conference.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"When a court case begins was a judge stating on the record;  'he doesn't like the accused,' that should be grounds for the judge to be removed from the case, before it's allowed to proceed. We've elevated judges to the level of omnipotence.  That has to change ASAP.  I would think Judges would have to answer to their superiors or some type of oversight board?  We're supposed to be guaranteed a fair trial and be judged by a jury of our peers.  When judges display an obviously blatant predisposition toward the accused, their due process decompensats from a prosecution to a political persecution. There needs to be a mechanism in place to hold the judges, DAs, etc. accountable for their behavior and wrongdoing, when on the bench 
I hope Kelly has some legal experts on to comment, if there is a mechanism to address misconduct of the judges, et. al., and to end persecutory trials.  If the witch hunters can come for Trump, they can come for any of us! What Trump's being put through, is a wake up call for some type of oversight board to  
monitor and address judge's conduct, behavior and compliance with ethics codes, or lack there of."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Megyn, did you have to show us the Whoopi clip?  Chortling with glee over the demise of anyone, even a supposed enemy, is always ugly, and I was eating..."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"L. James needs to see Dr. Phil now, poor baby didn't get her way.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Laurence Tribe is SUCH a Leftwing lackey, SUCH an f-ing boob."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,The women on view are burial who watches that trash
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Please stop giving The View exposure and media coverage. They're radical leftists who should not be featured anywhere.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"They shouldn't call it The View, they should call it The Vile, so much more appropriate"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,A few weeks ago there were so many Trump haters convinced that Trump would have to come up all the money before filing the appeal. Wrong again Trump haters.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Democrats are already proceeding with a plan to remove Trump off the ballot. They are going to use Congress to vote on removing him. They must pay RINOs like Gallagher and as many as they can, to leave office or vote with Democrats to remove him. After taking control of the House, when they know they’ll have enough votes, they will bring it to a vote. Maybe the only way to stop this is for real Republicans to be elected to Congress."
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"💥   W O W ,    When Trump Speaks ,   He's the  ""  PRESIDENT  ""  America Want's / Needs & Deserves  👏 👏 👏 👏"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Ladies of the view? I don't consider them ladies. I have a different name.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Ladies at the View?!? Are you kidding?! They are monsters in any and every-way!!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,We need TRUMP for 2024..❤❤
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Once again Justice wins. Democrats are keeping the tissue industry alive to wipe their salty tears over Trump WINNING against their blatant corruption.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Judge Arthur Engoron looks just like Lemony Snicket in A Series of Unfortunate Events.!!
Creepy"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Are the ladies on the View wiling to pay that much in bond or would they see it as unfair when it regard their money?
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Just once, when Megyn says ""Let's play the clip"" of these insufferable lefties, I'd like the guest to say ""Please God, NO!  Don't make me listen to THAT Megyn!""  That's for sure what I'm thinking!"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,How can someone be this stupid have a law license. They they give it to her because she is black? 🤦🏻‍♂️
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"If Trump can pay $150 000,000 cash to appeal a judgement, think he can whip out his billfold and pay $150,000 to keep some whore from talking trash at an in opportune time. Why is that a campaign finance violation?"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,All for the crime of borrowing money and paying it all back. Ironic the show is called the view. Blinders and tunnel vision would be more fitting. Letitia James toilet paper would be appropriate on so many levels and the closet she'll ever come to cleaning up NYC.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Reeks of kenton from the start of 2016
EJSbUkYM8Ig,No wonder its raining outside.... liberal tears! 😂😂
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Idk how this a win his lawyers just argued he didn’t have the money to pay the amount they wanted he still owes the the half a billion dollar payment his bond was just lowered
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Paying the bond is a democrat victory.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"Hey VIEW idiots, what will all the workers in Trump properties going to do if NYC locked up the doors ??"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,So is the government going to cover the expenses of getting this ridiculous Bond if he wins his appeal? I'm sure the interest will be too high
EJSbUkYM8Ig,"How many politicians in the federal government has paid hush money from our taxes to their sexual trists, and didn't write it down as to who, what, when, where and why?"
EJSbUkYM8Ig,There are no clearer case of prosecutorial abuse than this one  in the history of American!
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Thanks to Truckers
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Illegal against mr Trump.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump is great at baiting the media and others and then winding up having the last laugh. Kudos to him.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,I will go to Vote mr Trump 2024.

EJSbUkYM8Ig,No One Will not invest in New York State anymore. So Stupid
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Who else cannot wait ? To vote 🗳️ for trump in 2024 🇺🇸
EJSbUkYM8Ig,Trump is the truth & the light and sent by God to guide the world through the end times
EJSbUkYM8Ig,AG James and judge are Corruptions.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,New York State is a democrats State. Biden democrats want to interrupt mr Trump 2024 election.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,$175 Millions Bonds is still too Much Money.  Biden democrats is Set it up.
EJSbUkYM8Ig,All the Trump haters are making President Trump golden. Everything will fall to the ground! Trump is innocent!!!!!

uFRrHyYr9D8,LOL!
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Biden is admittedly saying that he only won against Donald Trump because the votes were rigged or something. Biden cheated and knows he can do it again, is what he's really saying. I feel if somebody  doesn't do something that crooked Joe Biden will win again. No matter how many states Donald Trump wins. Biden is evil."
uFRrHyYr9D8,😅😅
uFRrHyYr9D8,Only if the dead voters for you again
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden never beat Trump in the 1st place
uFRrHyYr9D8,Never will beat trump.
uFRrHyYr9D8,You cheated to get it
uFRrHyYr9D8,I love you on your knees but investigate your sponsors who are actually Debt Collectors
uFRrHyYr9D8,Megyn cracks me up with her impression 😂. I watched this a few times 😂
uFRrHyYr9D8,I can’t understand why they call this idiot president I don’t .
uFRrHyYr9D8,First of all he didn’t beat trump the swamp creatures in DC did by cheating America
uFRrHyYr9D8,joe biden sucks.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Some people can fool even themselves. Thats Joe
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden looks constipated.
uFRrHyYr9D8,You rock Megyn!!!
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Pathetic,Biden, couldn't beat anyone on his own, he's a creepy old failure. America is in ruins because of  him and the Democrat party."
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Is he serious!? Seriously??????
🤦‍♀️"
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden is delusional and demented…. He thinks he has done so much…Ha-ha!!!!
uFRrHyYr9D8,"This creepy repulsive blob of protoplasm is absolutely right and he has every right to be confident in his 2nd reinstallment  as “president” in November. If anyone thinks for even a nanosecond that the Dems haven’t already engineered a way to steal this election also, hohoho … you’re so naive. Trump will never be president again"
uFRrHyYr9D8,Sloppy Joe 😊!!!😊
uFRrHyYr9D8,Not a hope mate.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Trump needs to parody this immediately, getting a childs hands instead of his own!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,"If the best thing an incumbent President can say is ""I'm the only person to ever beat Donald Trump"" then his campaign is DOA."
uFRrHyYr9D8,It is not considered beating when you cheated.
uFRrHyYr9D8,He is sitting in a wheel chair.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Creepy Joe did not beat President Trump, as that election was stolen from President Trump & the American people.   What a moron & he does look like he was given a sear at the kiddie table, so he could sniff the hair of little girls."
uFRrHyYr9D8,No you cheated you’re way in! Disgraceful!!!
uFRrHyYr9D8,For the good off the country?? You seriously??? Your a Corrupt evil politician!
uFRrHyYr9D8,He could be in the Whitehouse bathroom sitting on the toilet seat.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Slow Joe, you NEVER beat President Trump. YOU CHEATED."
uFRrHyYr9D8,😃
uFRrHyYr9D8,"The Economist says the U.S. economy is the envy of the world, unless we wreck it with politics. Trump will sell off parts of the economy for personal cash in exchange for tariffs. He did it before and will do it again. He destroyed more US manufacturing jobs than he created, to enrich himself. If you work in metal fabrication and he gets elected, kiss your job goodbye."
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden lost the game con.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"HE HASN'T ACCOMPLISHED S@3t IN 50 YEARS FLEECING THE GOVERNMENT AND TAXPAYERS, WHY WOULD HE THE NEXT 4?"
uFRrHyYr9D8,Good luck Trumpers. No candidate in history has ever won by insulting 40% of the voters in their own party. Can you say Barry Goldwater?  Hubert Humphrey?  Jimmy Carter (second campaign)? Start making your November excuse up now.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Did he take too much medication? He's seems to miss syllables.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Yes, it’s true statements are more persuasive if said with your eyes open"
uFRrHyYr9D8,🤣🤣🤣🤣 Megyn you made me laugh😂😂😂 lol this is hilarious. This guy is a real dead pan until you cracked him up.
uFRrHyYr9D8,For the good of this country?  Where was he squeeking from? China.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Wonder how much tRumpf paid the disgraced megan to make this video?
uFRrHyYr9D8,"What drama in the Republican Party?  The Republican Party is at least holding primaries with contestants, thereby being democratic.  The Democrats, who claim to preserve democracy, won't allow any party member to challenge Old Man Joe Biden who is being protected by his party and the media.  And, the 2020 election was rigged starting with mail in balloting in the battleground states, a voting procedure not adopted by any legislatures in those states contrary to the Constitution."
uFRrHyYr9D8,Brandon’s entire life is a scripted event. And why is he creepily whispering?

uFRrHyYr9D8,"*ANYWAY THE WIND BLOWS MEGYN KELLY AND HER Little FREDDY*
Prediction:  After Biden kicks the crap out of Dump AGAIN, Megyn will quickly flip flop back to mocking DONALD’s tiny hands again.  Remember?  That’s where this idea came from (u think Rubio could’ve come up s something like that)! Hahaha!

She already has her set done up to DNC production standards, like the infamous Philly Patriot’s blood red!!!

Is this the journalism you envisaged for yourself Megyn?  Stories where you’re on your knees mocking little people and “how many takes?”  You ever seen how many takes it took Trump to do his “go home/you’re beautiful” J6 video!!!!?????"
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden’s most pressing issue is whether to get chocolate or rainbow sprinkles
uFRrHyYr9D8,Alzheimer’s is awful
uFRrHyYr9D8,....hes in his pyjama pants and diaper....hence the way its filmed
uFRrHyYr9D8,I guess Joe’s handlers still haven’t told him they cheated 🙄
uFRrHyYr9D8,"I got news for Joe. He didn't win the election in 2020. They cheated, they stole it when dead people vote and married women vote twice using maiden name and married name I have a problem with that"

uFRrHyYr9D8,"Wrong, Biden didn’t beat Trump. He knew this was his last chance to become president and he would do anything to win…. And he did"
uFRrHyYr9D8,Joe you didnt beat Donald Trump. The team put together to steal the election made you president.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"You didn't beat Donald Trump,  you were rigged in"
uFRrHyYr9D8,lil joey shrunk.
uFRrHyYr9D8,The only reason he’s in office is because him and his regime cheated
uFRrHyYr9D8,Let's go brandon!!!!
uFRrHyYr9D8,"For the record joe biden, you lost in 2020 and will get destroyed again!!! FACT!!!!!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Biden looks like a man with severe illness.  And he does.!  He has Dementia.  I can tell you where that is headed.  Why?  My late fathere had the same illness, it did not end well.  And when he was alive,  it was very difficult for the family.  Biden's end will come very soon, you can bet the ranch on that.   And , as with many people with dementia,   what Biden does behind closed doors is not good."

uFRrHyYr9D8,"Yes. It's true. He is the only one to beat Donald Trump. In fact he got more votes than any president in history. More votes than Obama. More votes than Reagan. More votes than the aliens in outer space. Of course, with a little help from the DNC and ballot harvesting and drop box stuffing. And lets not forget, late night tinkering."

uFRrHyYr9D8,Why do we continue to insist on voting for 70 and 80 year-olds? Can we institute a new maximum age of 70 for political office? Please?
uFRrHyYr9D8,JB's got to go if you want to save the country
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Was probably the best of several takes
😎🎥😎🎥😎🎥"
uFRrHyYr9D8,This is meaning less Megyn.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Megyn, Debt management companies charge 25% over the payment reduction [as their fee] to negotiate for you.  Sometimes it costs more with a debt management company than without one.  Fyi."
uFRrHyYr9D8,Problem-he never did beat Trump.  Imheo.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Whenever I see him, I think of, ""Weekend at Bernie's."" God help us."
uFRrHyYr9D8,You didn't win Joe 😂.
uFRrHyYr9D8,FJB
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Tarzan could manage ""I Tarzan you jane""...4 words.  Joe can't even do that"
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Funny how he has to say he beat Trump... we all know Biden DIDN'T win in 2020.  And if the 2024 election is fair, he won't beat Trump then, either."
uFRrHyYr9D8,But he didn't beat Trump.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Well. You just envy our most popular president.
uFRrHyYr9D8,I freakin LOVE the way you make fun of that jackass!!!😅
uFRrHyYr9D8,He stole it from Trump.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Actually Biden said in the 2020 election ""You don't have to vote for me I'm going to win anyway"""
uFRrHyYr9D8,Oh boy
uFRrHyYr9D8,Donald Trump is disgusted with everything American.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Joe Biden has never been any good for our country and he never will be.
uFRrHyYr9D8,You only won because you rigged an election you know it I know it he knows it you couldn't beat your way out of a wet paper bag a******
uFRrHyYr9D8,"He looks like Mr Bobblehead. And when has this selfish, narcissistic corrupt man ever given thought about the good of our country. His campaign will be all A.I. Heaven help us."
uFRrHyYr9D8,To begin with biden did not win the last election he is such an ass
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Joe the ""100 Take Dunder"" no joke!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden you did not beat donald trump!!!
uFRrHyYr9D8,Ick.
uFRrHyYr9D8,OMG Megyn 😂😂
uFRrHyYr9D8,Disturbing 😂
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden is Mr. Magoo 😂
uFRrHyYr9D8,Love Michael Knowles!!😇😇
uFRrHyYr9D8,Megyn and Michael...how come you two have not yet done a YES/NO game?!!!  We all want it!  It would be epic.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"My fellow democrats, together we can defeat the only person who can save America."
uFRrHyYr9D8,You didn't win you cheated.
uFRrHyYr9D8,For the good of the Country! How stupid are you people who would vote for Biden AGAIN!
uFRrHyYr9D8,"I'm not sure if ""sitting president"" is quite right--maybe reclining president...or sleeping president...  :)"
uFRrHyYr9D8,You mean stole the election
uFRrHyYr9D8,"ALL Americans should be incensed at this dolt's lies--no matter what party you vote! If you can't be objective or analyze the candidates you vote for, then you'll choke on the horse manure; and live with the smell (and the rest of us, too).  And a lot of us Americans are damned tired of all the illegal, immoral, constitution and bill of rights trampling that goes on in our country!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,There came the real Truth that they have such a lock o'n the system. 80+% republicans want Trump. Maybe 60% dems want Biden. Do the Math. IT'S WHO COUNTS THE VOTES.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Biden looks like a child sitting at a table that is too high for him.
uFRrHyYr9D8,The White House social media team uses Artificial intelligence to help Joe Biden.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Bring it on .....TRUMP  2024
uFRrHyYr9D8,No one voted 'for' Biden. They voted against Trump.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Hi Megyn. I'm writing in response to YouTube.  I've subscribed to your channel, and they keep notifying me of these videos.  I don't know why, but I am glad . It gives me reason to talk to you. ...P.S.  I don't like making fun of the president. It's too easy."
uFRrHyYr9D8,He thinks he is saving our country? Good Lord help us!!
uFRrHyYr9D8,The sad part of this is that there are people that will still vote for this guy!  There must be a lot of not to bright  people in this country.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Only two types of voters support Biden, Billionaires & Idiots, check your bank account to see which one you are."
uFRrHyYr9D8,"He beat Trump by sleeping in the basement?...nice photoshoot of him, his eyes fixed on the teleprompter while his fingers signaling ""hurry hurry I gonna use the bathro*m"""
uFRrHyYr9D8,Ok i get it ...... but why mock him so 😮
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Exactly, that cut tells he couldn't even do the 12 sec clip all in one go. Boy Biden looks super old in that video as well."
uFRrHyYr9D8,Joe's a liar again he's not looking forward to beating trump he's scared to death of him trying to get him off ballots anything he can to stop him
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Haha. No, HAHA!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,It's always laughable to watch Uncle Jo pretend to be President.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Biden has been a clown well before becoming president. Its gotten worse when he was ""elected"". America has fallen so bad. Elect Donald Trump fairly. .... He won four years ago....."
uFRrHyYr9D8,Hey Kelly. Did you change trumps diaper. He seems a little ripe. Lol
uFRrHyYr9D8,We all know the only reason he beat Trump was because the Demorats cheated with the massive ballot harvested after the polls closed and installed Briben as the president.
uFRrHyYr9D8,If I was Joe Biden I would have said the same thing you know Trump will get all pissed off and go crazy over that.
uFRrHyYr9D8,maybe sitting in a wheelchair???
uFRrHyYr9D8,The Sitting President is a very accurate description of Biden. Because he can barley stand and cant walk.
uFRrHyYr9D8,They only need to keep him alive until the Democrat convention so they can pull a Torricelli and replace him with Michelle Obama.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Cheating on election there no way 5 different states could get hundreds of votes at exactly at the same time
uFRrHyYr9D8,"That is the democrat, RINO, never Trump's plan, not to make America great, safe and prosperous, just beat Trump."
uFRrHyYr9D8,We must tell them Joe and Donald have to debate.
uFRrHyYr9D8,You guys really bitch slapped brandon's PR people.
uFRrHyYr9D8,If Biden ever wants any type of chance to beat Trump he better start working on his poll number of 28%. With what’s on his plate and what he has to deal with it’s easy to say it’s literally impossible you’d have a better chance to see the Red Sea split again then Biden winning the election
uFRrHyYr9D8,Was this AI?
uFRrHyYr9D8,Trump or War
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Use spliced takes? No
Heavy use of Deep Fakes? Guaranteed!!!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Bizarre, that’s all you can say…….bizarre."
uFRrHyYr9D8,It's ai generated
uFRrHyYr9D8,Why vertical video format? So weird.
uFRrHyYr9D8,What a clown...🤡🤡🤡
uFRrHyYr9D8,Republicans are incredibly predictable because they are simple minded
uFRrHyYr9D8,"“We have put together, I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics” - Joe Biden"
uFRrHyYr9D8,"81,000,000 votes, eh?"
uFRrHyYr9D8,This reminds me of the old Star Trek episode where the alternate-world Nazi leader turned out to be a drugged up political puppet.
uFRrHyYr9D8,Um you didn’t win an election. Your side successfully stole an election and you are playing prince Palestine of the empire taking on the little systems. You’re a joke!
uFRrHyYr9D8,"It'll be fun watching Joe and Kamala get thrown out of the van come the Democrat primary, but also frightening to think who might replace them."
uFRrHyYr9D8,Donny struggles just to breath and drink water. So what’s your point?
uFRrHyYr9D8,You didn’t beat trump you cheated no way are there 81 million voters who are brain dead
uFRrHyYr9D8,😂😂😂 looks like a child at a school table.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"The president has dementia, gonna get worse, i mean what president sniffs hair of children?"
uFRrHyYr9D8,FJB
uFRrHyYr9D8,Ballot stuffing and the CIA beat Trump.
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Biden beat no one. He cheated! Big bad Biden… So intimidating, so powerful! Such a joke!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,TRUMP WON Megyn...DO THE MATH.
uFRrHyYr9D8,He beats Trump by cheat! FJB
uFRrHyYr9D8,Megan kelly spunds like a fuxking fool
uFRrHyYr9D8,Not legally you did not beat President Trump  the election was stolen and they have it all
uFRrHyYr9D8,Stairs 4 - Biden 0 😂
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Wtf has happened to America with this idiot Biden..... He's about one step away from a heart attack, definitely no steps away from stupid."
uFRrHyYr9D8,"I heard his usual mumble-garble-spit. Ew, gross!"
uFRrHyYr9D8,"He's doing a better job than trump ever did and he treats people with respect. Biden is a brilliant leader, Trump is a piece of s*it. It bothers republicans so much that he's sitting down low. Lol. 😅 Oh Megyn with a y, you're so stunned."
uFRrHyYr9D8,He isn't the commander of anything
uFRrHyYr9D8,Wait till you see trump in 3-4 years. You will be doing the same. By then he will dump too
uFRrHyYr9D8,He can't even beat himself properly.😅
uFRrHyYr9D8,They really should feed him more high sugar ice cream before doing those ads!!!
uFRrHyYr9D8,Trump beat him in a 1 day election-FACT
uFRrHyYr9D8,"LOL he didn't ""beat"" Trump-Covid ballots stole the election for him, in the most irregular and unconstitutional election in US history"
uFRrHyYr9D8,Laughable and sad
uFRrHyYr9D8,"Why laugh, he won running a campaign from his basement.  They will use the Fetterman approach like the Primarys where they dragged a stroke victim across the finish line.  Bet Biden won't even do any debates this time because they don't need to."
uFRrHyYr9D8,You bit Trump because the people was blind now the people see who you are Biden
uFRrHyYr9D8,woke photographers lol
uFRrHyYr9D8,"With all the important things going on, why are we taking the time to pick this apart in this way. geez."
uFRrHyYr9D8,Please people reject mail in ballots! We need American citizens to go to the polls in person and vote on paper ballots. Otherwise the 10 to 15 million illegal immigrants will vote for their interests.
uFRrHyYr9D8,I don't think it matters that much how he looks.  What he says matters more and what he said wasn't bad. Looks matters is a pretty shallow view.
uFRrHyYr9D8,He never beat President Trump.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Just just be happy she didnt do it to cod
e-jZQDMmYlg,This is bullcrap Fortnite is a fricking gun game bruh
e-jZQDMmYlg,"... So it's a game within fortnite? Fortnite still exists the way it does though? I don't play the game.
But who cares? Even AAA game stuidos make dumb mistakes..
It was actually cool she gave it a go. I doubt a politician would go down well if she released a game with violence."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Kamala doesn't have a 🧠 the kids that play this game are not old enough too vote. This wasn't Smart.
e-jZQDMmYlg,SMH...
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Good, make that trash game even trashier lol."
e-jZQDMmYlg,But yet can't gain control guns in school shootings or in the world fir that matter it's just a video game people lightin up 😅😂😂😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,😂😂😂. BYE FELICIA 😂😂😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Kamala needs to be banned from talking and figure out how shes going to pay her 20 mil debt.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Is there planes?
e-jZQDMmYlg,Freedom Town made me Flasid and puke at the same time. I may galge my eyes out. (This is a joke)
e-jZQDMmYlg,BOOOOOOOO KAMALA!😂 what did this even acomplish
e-jZQDMmYlg,"As a wise man once said ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" like seriously, guns are just tools that can kill people, just like knives, you gonna ban knives in america too?- 🤦‍♂️"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Shit good thing she didn't win
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Kamala is a damn dictator, i bet trump is better for usa, even if im a foreigner."
e-jZQDMmYlg,TRUMP 2024❤
e-jZQDMmYlg,"She gonna ban 
call of duty guns
Gta
Resident evil
Pubg 
And so much more"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Welp she loss the election so her laws and stuff she had plan goes downhill
e-jZQDMmYlg,Fortnight gave them this platform. Let that sink in.
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Weird ,, Eminem supports Kemala , Eminem is in Fortnight,  Kemala wants to ban guns in a game Eminem is in ,,,,, wtf is wrong with these people?"
e-jZQDMmYlg,This aged so fine
e-jZQDMmYlg,She lost LOL
e-jZQDMmYlg,"😂😂😂
Even I wouldn’t want to bother playing her map. 😂😂😂"
e-jZQDMmYlg,She definitely didnt get a chicken dinner
e-jZQDMmYlg,"She banned guns in ONE map of hers, not the entire map, not the entire game either. There are other maps that also have guns disabled or banned because those maps are either for looking around, parkour, horror, fun in general, and prop hunt. Stop acting as if she banned Fortnite for all eternity, stop acting like she ruined the game when it already was ruined. Yall will find anything to make her look bad lol."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Home Depot simulator could have been the game of the year in 2020
e-jZQDMmYlg,They made it too easy for trump to win ngl
e-jZQDMmYlg,Brainwashing young voters. As always.
e-jZQDMmYlg,LMAO what?
e-jZQDMmYlg,Hopefully this potential job is canceled since she’s not gonna be president.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Freedom Town sounds boring
e-jZQDMmYlg,Thank god Kamala lost.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Is this satire?
e-jZQDMmYlg,So they ban guns in forynite but cant close our borders????
e-jZQDMmYlg,😂😂😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,That's petty for a kids game
e-jZQDMmYlg,Trump bans Kamala in Real Town USA...LANDSLIDE!!!
e-jZQDMmYlg,It was an mistake also fortnite is kids game so this is funny as hell
e-jZQDMmYlg,I am so glad she did not win because we have a right to bear arms i hate her now
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Spoiler alert, didn't work"
e-jZQDMmYlg,I don't even play Fortnite but this is the most hilarious thing ever. Who approved this?
e-jZQDMmYlg,"All this hot air crap that Harris spits out about what she is gonna change and do for the American people she could of done in the 4 yrs previous!!! Anyway does not matter now Bless her , I wonder if she can still see the craters on the Moon with her knaked eye while looking through a powerful telescope, she really said that?"
e-jZQDMmYlg,This is why Kamala lost by 40 votes
e-jZQDMmYlg,"im not for kamala at all nor am I trying to defend her ###, but this is actually what alot of the maps under the creative gamemode look like on fortnite: ❌🔫❌

Tho I do still think it was funny that she was trying to appeal to a playerbase who the overall majority of said playerbase can't even vote 😂

now what disney wants to do with guns all-around (all gamodes: Battle Royale & Creative in fortnite is wild"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Thank god trump won
e-jZQDMmYlg,😂 uh....it's a Shooting Game Camela 😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Ain't too smart that one...
e-jZQDMmYlg,"""HOW. DO. YOU. DO. FELLOW. KIDS?!?!?!"" - Schaffarilas Productions, 2024"
e-jZQDMmYlg,What does she want us to play? Forknite?
e-jZQDMmYlg,No she didn’t 😂 Stick to gun reviews
e-jZQDMmYlg,Pretty much Minecraft..... With our swords and bows .....
e-jZQDMmYlg,.
e-jZQDMmYlg,"She isn't ""banning"" shit 😂🤣😅😞"
e-jZQDMmYlg,I never thought i'd pity Fortnight players
e-jZQDMmYlg,hmmm... this sounds like something disney would do with their characters
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Imagine the cost of building that level, mini games etc.... Holy crap, the waste is staggering."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Kamala wanted to win the election by treating the people like dumb babies... No wonder the wokes behave like dumb cry babies now that she won't be president.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Exactly why I'm glad that I didn't Vote for her.
e-jZQDMmYlg,"I may not like Fortnite cause I'm not usually fond of Battle Royale, but I respect that game enough to not want to see politics get involved. Especially if it messes with the game's identity."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Well good news for everyone then Trump won she lost.
e-jZQDMmYlg,fortnite battle Royale was actually designed to have fun and not always have weapons the only problem is the way to get fortnite toys like a basketball to play basketball or golf you are a frisbee beach ball even a pig skin you came frouette around but this was on first of a map
e-jZQDMmYlg,LEGO does a have guns besides if it was in a movie and you can play LEGO on fortnite the evil phone rocket league
e-jZQDMmYlg,fortnite is literally mostly played by underage kids tf?
e-jZQDMmYlg,Nobody saw this video in the last 5 to 6 days because YouTube hit it from them as the comments on the first person to comment in a few days that’s weird
e-jZQDMmYlg,"If I didn’t see this video pop up in the last six days, it means that YouTube hate it for me"
e-jZQDMmYlg,"And what will this solve? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

But what I find interesting about US politics today is that both sides seem very intent on turning the US into a dictatorship. Think about it. The democrats think Trump is gonna be the next third reich german dictator and the republicans think that harris is gonna be the next red russia union dictator. But what about both sides? What if both sides as in the people in power in both sides are all in agreement to turn the US into a dictatorship? Yea no one thought of that. I think im the only one who thought of this, so most likely people from both sides will think Im mentally insane, but if it happens, which it will by the way, I told you so. Let that phrase sink in. ""I told you so."" Let it sink in. Both sides of the people in power all wanting a dictatorship and they make us fight each other as a way of means of making it look like we have power in the government still. But we do not and they know it. And them hiding this, will prove my point, hell klling me will also prove my point as well. The entire government is corrupt and the only way to fix it at this point is a full hard factory reset on the government."
e-jZQDMmYlg,This is stupid guess kamala doesnt like fun in games seems she would be the kinda person if she was or is a mom an go guns in games are violent an rotting kids brains lets banned guns...bs
e-jZQDMmYlg,Why don’t she just go away…already
e-jZQDMmYlg,"I actually think its a good idea. Every game doesn't have to have guns. I play COD for that, but i love the idea of having other activities other than shooting all of the time."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Have a good Veterans Day Colin Noir
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Kamala: Next stop, COD!"
e-jZQDMmYlg,I’m not a Fortnite fan or GTA 👎🏻
e-jZQDMmYlg,Kids cant vote...
e-jZQDMmYlg,I’m glad I don’t play that garbage game and I will never let my kids play it lol
e-jZQDMmYlg,Thank God she lost...
e-jZQDMmYlg,I subscribed
e-jZQDMmYlg,And the gamers will revolt or leave the game entirely
e-jZQDMmYlg,PATHETIC AF. Least now we know our guns aren't going anywhere. TRUMP NATION once again 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Bruh no tf she didnt lmao. She didnt even make president and guess what, they still have guns in their game just liek every COD game and other shooter game. Yall need to stop with the misinformation. Read and learn ur facts and SHOW evidence before yapping."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Bruh at least trumps does a 99 hit combo in street fighter i wont be amazed lol
e-jZQDMmYlg,"She isn't anti gun if she claims to ""own a gun."" Like she told Oprah 😂😂"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Fhisnis why she shouldn’t be president
e-jZQDMmYlg,DONALD IN OFFICE LET’s GO!
e-jZQDMmYlg,You should do this to GTA jk
e-jZQDMmYlg,Reasons she ain’t president
e-jZQDMmYlg,"I live in a ridiculously blue state where they made gun ownership tough as nails.
Now that the country is back on track after her defeat at the hands of an undeniable landslide victory... I am finally considering working through all the tests to become a legally certified firearm owner. I never thought I’d have the chance, but finally I have hope again."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Noooooooooo
e-jZQDMmYlg,This is just another reason why she lost😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,I remember hearing about this and it genuinely made me turn of the computer and head outside
e-jZQDMmYlg,The only people playing it were probably achievement hunters.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Bro you said it all. I felt every word and I don't play fortnite but just to think they coming for your games is a horrible foreshadowing of our reality.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Dude come on. There’s no way you believe this
e-jZQDMmYlg,Koala ruins fortnite
e-jZQDMmYlg,Fortnite is for children that can’t handle the blood of call of duty 😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Maybe this is a factor on why she lost. There are ALOT of Fortnite players.
e-jZQDMmYlg,I uninstalled fortnite I'm not with the woke agenda
e-jZQDMmYlg,Wait... I never even heard of this and I play Fortnite on the daily
e-jZQDMmYlg,Huh ?! 😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Luckily we got Trump back.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Funny part of this i got a ad for fortnight that is using mini guns and rocket right at the beginning
e-jZQDMmYlg,I'm not surprised.
e-jZQDMmYlg,as a gamer i nvr have played that game nor ever will when a game developer that gets political like that shouldn't be in business. pay attention Blizzard
e-jZQDMmYlg,SIMS?
e-jZQDMmYlg,Minecraft would have been a better platform as there is no guns in that game excluding mods.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Welp she's not president sooooo
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Nah, kamala harris lost tho"
e-jZQDMmYlg,this is cap
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Fortnite? No thank you, I'll stay in the Badlands to fight for Gravel."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Great map for rioting😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,How'd this map work out for her?
e-jZQDMmYlg,Update … she ain’t doing shit now but packing her office
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Ngl bro, i think you took this one out of context quite a bit and theres definitely some fear mongering tactics in this video. There are a bunch of maps in the game where there are no guns. They are gamemodes like obstacle courses and racing. Just because there arent guns in the map doesn't mean she ""wants to ban virtual firearms"". The fact of the matter is, her campaign team tried a tactic to appeal to young voters, fair enough. Too bad the ""voters"" shes trying to appeal to are 12 years old lol. 

So relax, videos game guns are safe as they are protected by the first amendment lol"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Is this satire?
e-jZQDMmYlg,What next call of duty
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Too be a bit fair there are already plenty of creative maps in fortnite that don't have any weapons in them. Like most deathrun maps, some roleplay, a few adventure map here and there, etc. Not really a new concept for a fortnite creative maps to lack any weapons in them. And there's obviously no weapons in festival or rocket racing modes either.

So it's not really an original concept they've came up with either, not by a long shot"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Thank God she will NOT be our president!
e-jZQDMmYlg,I'd really laugh if they did it for COD
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Theres other games on fortnite that doesn't have weapons 
Like obby and tycoon games
Also she's stupid ether way"
e-jZQDMmYlg,That's pathetic. Everyone who plays this game should get their money back. Send it back and demand a refund. F*ck that game developer. I won't buy anything they make.
e-jZQDMmYlg,I thought that was a meme! That was real?! 😆🤣😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,What? LMAO politics in video games? I knew I didn't play fortnight for a reason. That's sad. Super sad. I quit playing franchises that support real world agendas.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Theres no way this is real💀
e-jZQDMmYlg,The majority of people who play Fortnite are not old enough to vote 😂😂😂😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Trump 2024!!!
e-jZQDMmYlg,lol theres a difference between banning guns in a game and making a part of that game without guns. I dont even play fortnite and I can tell you that theres tons of community made maps that dont involve guns. either it just wasnt mentioned in the video or theres nothing related to this map saying guns are banned for political reasons. this video is so idiotic if thats actually the case
e-jZQDMmYlg,Fake news
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Imagine if Kamala had removed police from Need for Speed, which is the last racing game franchise to still have police chases. It would just be another Forza Horizon clone."
e-jZQDMmYlg,This shit is why we voted for trump
e-jZQDMmYlg,Bro what
e-jZQDMmYlg,Knew there was no guns in that map the don’t know how to attach to Fortnite players we want to fight each other the only thing people use maps without guns for are pretty much death runs and roleplay
e-jZQDMmYlg,Yeah she won't touch Fallout and Starfield. Bethesda won't let her
e-jZQDMmYlg,"It wouldn't surprise me if she tried to take the crime out of GTA. The way she changes so much (especially back and forth) I've started referring to her as ""Chameleon Harris"""
e-jZQDMmYlg,Lol no one playing that trash
e-jZQDMmYlg,"well as a Fortnite player, not all UEFN maps have guns. But I do see where the irony is 😂"
e-jZQDMmYlg,She had to destroy more fun before she left office
e-jZQDMmYlg,This aged like fine wine
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Good idea on paper, piss poor execution. A good gaming map would get some gamers' attention but whoever thought a weaponless map in a shooter was a good idea is an idiot."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Freedom Town... that gives me Tony Montana flashbacks
e-jZQDMmYlg,Hahaha there are bunch of small game modes in fortnite that don't have guns she didn't ban anything there was just no reason to add guns in this game mode. I love your channel but know what your talking about first mannn lol
e-jZQDMmYlg,The days of legacy media are over.  It's the 3 hour podcasts that showed the 18 to 24 year olds Trump isn't the monster the left make him out to be.
e-jZQDMmYlg,And she wonders why she lost the election 😂😂😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,I see what you mean but I find what you've said to be stupid. Have you not realised that there are maps in fortnite and even official modes that don't have guns? You saying that the map is not fun specifically because there are no guns and it's made in a shooter game is enough to make me question what motivated you to make this the topic of the video. Does that mean that rocket racing isn't fun because it's all about cars? Does it mean that the fall guys maps aren't fun because you can't shoot other players? I've played a multiplayer horror map with one singular weapon that only one player can hold at a time and I find it to be a good game. Even the lego mode doesn't have guns and there are still a lot of people who play it. (Crossbows aren't guns and the star wars blasters were temporary.)
e-jZQDMmYlg,Isn't Fortnight something mostly 13 year olds play?
e-jZQDMmYlg,The avg fortnite player is like 14 what the hell were they thinking 😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Only up game mode in fortnight.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Didnt FreedomTown was the little refugee center for cubans in the 80s?
e-jZQDMmYlg,Whole game should be banned
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Remember when she said on the debate ""Nobodys gonna take the Americans guns away""?"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Dam my kids sure are going to miss that game. Its getting deleted tomorrow.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Kamala has tainted Fortnite with her politics. Can't never be played.
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Hey, who's watching this the day after the election? 😂"
e-jZQDMmYlg,"""Freedom town"" more like ""propaganda town"""

e-jZQDMmYlg,"I play Fortnite sometimes. Occasionally my Fortnite friends want to play driving or jumping game modes in Fortnite. I don't play these game modes, as they are SO boring. I play Fortnite to SHOOT."
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Once Trump gets done with y'all... Oh boy, what a sad fate."
e-jZQDMmYlg,"We've been saved, Imagine trump didnt win and the no guns in fortnite thing actually happened  everyone would hate it"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Nonsense
e-jZQDMmYlg,Too bad trumps president
e-jZQDMmYlg,So that’s how she lost! I was wondering.
e-jZQDMmYlg,"""What kind of impact could this have on the campaign?"" 

Absolutely fucking zero , none. People will meme this and that's it."
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Kamala, You’re Fired 😂"
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Doesn’t matter anyway. She lost and that’s a game i most definitely don’t care about. Best shooting games is Borderlands, Gears Of War, Anthem, The First Descendant."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Banning guns in Fortnite is crazy. I bet next election she's gonna try to ban them in Call of Duty too.
e-jZQDMmYlg,I see we're getting a head-start with the disinformation.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Funny enough I think that's what got Trump the presidency millions of kids playing fortnite their parents who didn't care enough to vote woke up got some coffee walked in their kids room to see them playing Kamala Harris fortnite and say to themselves you know I do kind of like Trump's policies😂😂😂😂😂😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Looks like we’re going back to cod

e-jZQDMmYlg,"I once remember another propaganda video that popped out of nowhere in Fortnite, but that caused a truce among players and throw tomatoes toward the screen."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Not gonna happen now.....by Harris !!
e-jZQDMmYlg,"A couple hundred played, conveniently a couple hundred also helped design it."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Well... We won't have to worry about her much longer!!  Congrats everyone!
e-jZQDMmYlg,Really!!😮
e-jZQDMmYlg,She should have tried NFS if she wanted to get votes
e-jZQDMmYlg,"What, no Freedom Town in Escape From Tarkov?

Jinkees."
e-jZQDMmYlg,Don't worry America just banned Harris 😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,SHE AINT BANNING SHIT NOW IS SHE? LMAO TRUMP 2024!!!!!!!
e-jZQDMmYlg,"With the power of hindsight, turns out she proved she was no better than Hillary! ...a failed candidate and a relic of the past"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Trump needs a black ops 6 skin
e-jZQDMmYlg,It's same call of duty
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Why politics in Fortnite, wtf is wrong with this game bro!?"
e-jZQDMmYlg,Going for younger people on a game to vote this is soo political man this sucks
e-jZQDMmYlg,Its like she wants us to be violent
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Are you serious, my dude? Ffs man. This is dumb af bro and you know it. What even is this channel? There are a lot of maps and game modes from creations that don't allow guns. Like, man. Bro. This is desperate content. Like, man. Come on. 🤦‍♂️"
e-jZQDMmYlg,So what your saying is you are totally voting for Kamala right? LOL!
e-jZQDMmYlg,That's shit should be fucking illegal 😡
e-jZQDMmYlg,Me waiting for hackers to implement guns on the map 😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,"Just voted, glad I didn't vote for her!"
e-jZQDMmYlg,"She's not wining votes with this.

Side note (you can tell who plays and who doesn't): Fornite has LOTS of side quest and games that DON'T involve shooting! CRAZY Right!! lol who would have guessed. Literally maps are built for players to climb/jump on items called ""Only up."" This take of yours is really a stretch lol. I love my guns, Love my games, love my weed. But you def should have talked/researched a lil more on the game itself before publishing this take... Again, most folks that follow you probably don't play the game either.."
e-jZQDMmYlg,There are lots of maps in Fortnite without guns.
e-jZQDMmYlg,0:44 huh. Maybe I should play Fortnight to finally know what Harris' policies actually are.
e-jZQDMmYlg,this is not true
e-jZQDMmYlg,Nah what 😂
e-jZQDMmYlg,Fortnight La la land.
e-jZQDMmYlg,Go vote protect 2A
e-jZQDMmYlg,Not sure why any of this surprises me anymore...
e-jZQDMmYlg,next you will eat the bugs and drink corn syrup to regain health and shield as part of the freedom town update
e-jZQDMmYlg,"I think the removal of guns in a Fortnite map isn’t that bad. It just doesn’t make the game fun, meaning not many people will play it, meaning Kamala ain’t getting the gamers votes."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Everyone is about to find out the hard way. The abuse of red flag laws to disarm people of color and people that oppose his attempts at fascism is about to get messy.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,They want to silence social media now we are turning communist
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Everything they accuse is what they are guilty of
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"She is against almost all the amendments, I have heard her many times taking on the Constitution."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Why she sounds drunk here? She sound slurrish
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I'm having a hard time with your links 😂 all they lead me to is t shirts, but I'm looking for the hoodie. Also I saw the ""NEW need money"" and that also brought me to t shirts"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She is right.!!  He has too a dictator can not allow the general public to have firearms.... Germans were not aloud to posses guns when the nazis took their country.... I will be surprised if it doesn't Remember the 2 people who already tried to kill him were republicans.....................
Gf7CtWV1mkY,I would really enjoy watching an interview of Kamala Harris by Colion Noir.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Thanks to all the voters so we don't have to worry about that liar. For now, stay strong and carry on 🇺🇸"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She'll never be able to prove that he said he's going to eliminate the Constitution.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I am my own president, always have been, always will be. I'll die on that hill."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Come on @colion noir, I love ya content and I’ve been a subscriber of you for years. As black republican gun owner it was you and hickok45 I got all my gun news from when I first got into guns when I moved from New York City to the south in 2014! As a republican I may not agree with everything or even most of what Kamala Harris says but let’s be adults man you know how to pronounce her name. You pronounced it correctly at the beginning of your video. So why be disrespectful? Is that necessary? The sad part about this is it’s always your own ppl. It’s no diff than when to be rude to you ppl would pronounce ya name a “Colin”. We all have free speech however, theirs no need to be this childish"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,So who was talking about mandatory buybacks which amounts to confiscation?? The lying Kamala that's who
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Once again, a perfectly reasoned and articulated response to the sea of disinformation and selectively-edited mainstream news."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Did she just spill the beans on what the second 
"" assumption attempt "" was really about ?"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I'm pretty sure that when an election is stolen or can be stolen then that would make a big part of the constitution void and invalid in some respect ......And yes the election was stolen a verry simple understanding of voting stats and data make it pretty clear......
The only elections in history that had a leading candidate at  the close of the pols only to wake up the next day to be behind is during election proven to be stolen and the numbers were way off anything close to any election in out history it was stolen and the judges FBI DOJ KNOW IT"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Wow how Kamala can lie like that .
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Democrats will say anything for votes.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Just like her to never answer a questions.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Who are they going to blame after trump?
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Im so sick of her i cant go on listening to her lies for 4 more tears
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Let's avoid the question.
 The REAL question is , Should you, Kamala, be president of the U.S.?  
And .
Trump never threatened to take guns away when he was in office ."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"As far as rights go.  Neither choice is a good choice.

Vote one way, and a set of rights and freedoms are in jeopardy. 

Vote the other way,  and an entirely different yet equally important set of rights and freedoms are in peril."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,I’m so tired of hearing blatant lies. I honestly can’t believe that people believe this lie about Trump getting rid of the constitution. These people are wicked and slimy. Their day is coming where they will bow to Jesus Christ and then they’ll be cast into hell.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,And we don't have a democracy; we have a constitutional republic.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,And she is the one who wants to end the Constitution. She has already said it in so many words.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,So does the government have the right to take your gun rights away from you?
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"All the same guns and ammo have been around since day 1. People have been killed good or bad since day 1 by the same things. Its only band and made effect now because of social media. THE GUN AND HOW IT LOOKS ISNT THE ISSUE, THEY ALLLLLLLL SHOOT THE SAME TYPES OF AMMO REGARDLESS OF THE LOOK OF THE GUN WHICH MEANS THE SAME EFFECT IN THE END. The same damage happens when loading ammo and pulling the trigger regardless of the  style of the firearm.. its all rediculous. Punish the parents and the kids that do the bad deed, stop punishing all the law abiding citizens that live right and just want too have fun."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,she took guns away in Fortnite
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"What a lair ,,,Trump won't ,,she will ,,,she said it in 2007"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,B
Gf7CtWV1mkY,If she wins  she will stack the Supreme Court second amendment rights will be gone
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Gun laws or second amendment rights is a false choice vp Harris maybe disarm America from within 1930s Germany Adolph Hitler had gun laws no jews could own a firearm o well birds of a feather fly together
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"This haves to be her most stupid comment that her lieing mouth has spit out,democrats still lieing"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She’s right!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,They blame trump for everything they themselves stand for.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"He did say take away the guns figure the rest out later, idk how yall can trust any politicians! I watch this channel for the gun content, I don’t give a shit about politics! UNSUBSCRIBED."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,All dems know how to do is project
Gf7CtWV1mkY,This woman is pathetically stupid.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Kamala is dangerous for us i dont know how stupid people dont see it they just see a face. I cant!!! I cantttt!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,... meanwhile she literally said it herself she wants to ☠️
Gf7CtWV1mkY,WOW. Their lying and projecting is getting out of control!!!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Election Day is just a few hours away. Get out and VOTE!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Kamala is the one who will take away the second amendment. She is not fooling anyone, except the fools in the democrat party"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Projection
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Shes the one saying she was going to take away guns
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Complete LIE!  She’s a joke
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Everytime this women opens her mouth against Trump, she is actually telling you what she is planning."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Trump won’t be allowed to even own a gun if he loses this election. Convicted felon
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Can you make a video explaining trumps federal criminal charges
Gf7CtWV1mkY,When might you be ready to run for Congress? Maybe Governor? You would do well in Texas.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,The president alone can’t do that. Kamala and Biden have been trying for 4 years. Thank goodness for checks and balances.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Who is policing her. She is speaking to millions of people, spreading misinformation, disinformation, and lies."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,1 thing so……many people aren’t paying attention to is if Trump was going to do what they’re saying he’s “going to do”he would’ve done when he was The President the 1st time.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I cant believe that some Americans actually want this lady to be our commander and chief, we will be in big trouble if that happens😮"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,I mean Democrats have done nothing about Guns for 30 years. Meanwhile Bump Stocks were lost under Trump. Facts are Facts.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,U vote  for him and his police immunity then bro
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Yes  he should  be president . and the constitution is going stay and can not change it.  has to be voted  for change in the government  laws
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"How does it feel to be going against Trump in the election. Well, um, i was born in a middle-class family"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She is a known and proven liar
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Absolutely not  TRUMP IS AMERICA  AND IS 100 PERCENT FOR  ALL
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Sharpe is a fool….just lets her lie without challenging her? What a punk
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Harris is clueless
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"this is why i dislike politics. no matter who your candidate is, youre going to make excuses for the dumb shit they say/do, and amplify and even twist the dumb shit the opponent says/does.. and it just infects and creates divisive content on platforms that should have nothing to do with politics.. cant wait till the election is over and everybody goes back to what they do best and not shilling for their preferred candidate."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,ive never seen such blatant lying about your opponent. and the projection is insane. shes accusing him of things she wants to do.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Now she’s claiming he wants to terminate the constitution? Really? And she thinks people will believe that???
Gf7CtWV1mkY,To think one man has the  power to change the constitution shows how dumb democrats are . The government doesn't work that way ex.Republicans had to agree to give 36 billion to Ukraine  in one  covid relief bill just to get democrats  to give 2 billion in relief for Americans during covid .. democrats made Americans suffer for months not passing the bill to get that money for Ukraine.  .
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"That fact the you attempt to interpret something different that Trump has stated is very disingenuous.  Trump says what he means and means what he says period!  It has been proven that he has lied over 30k times as president and continues to lie to the American people.  The bottom line is he should not be allowed to run for office.  He has been impeached twice, found liable for rape, stole classified documents, found guilty of defrauding charities, 34 count felon, and wannabe dictator that continues to divide the country and spew racism.  It’s not about her it’s about him.  So stop with the BS, continue to review guns and 2A content and don’t mislead your followers by telling untruths!"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"So black Americans are more concerned about their 4,5 and 6th amendment rights? By far left audiology that sounds  like a racist statement😂😂😂"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,God she lies
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She really is desperate at this point to make a claim like this
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"How long did she sit for Shannon Sharpe's interview? YET she wouldn't sit for 2 - 3 hours with Joe Rogan. Why not? 
Shannon does long style interviews also... 
Did she make him cut time back??"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,He should absolutely BE THE PRESIDENT!!!!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"His first statement made sense too. Not sure where the confusion came from. If they can steal an election, they can obviously circumvent the constitution as well."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Dude she won't let people have digital guns
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"The question is, Why would anyone want the halfbreed fascist as the President?"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"And the social media platforms are NOT speaking directly to the people. Twitter and others allows for the PEOPLE to talk directly to the PEOPLE!! But yeah, let's just stop free speech because the wacky liberals don't like what WE THE PEOPLE have to say!! Smh"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,This lady is so disingenuous it's unreal. Trump said he wants to terminate the constitution?!!! What a clown.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"This lady is a walking, talking confessions through projections bot. Everything she said he will do she has already said and done."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,How she’s talking about the first amendment when democrats are the main party who censor ppl? 😂 what???
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"The person that wants a *MANDATORY GUN BUYBACK* is trying to tell us that her opponent will take away the 2nd Amendment?🤣

Even if Trump wanted to do that, the President doesn’t have the power to repeal a Constitutional Amendment. That would require a Constitutional Convention and a super majority vote. A President cannot achieve that. A party could, but not a President. And the Republican Party would never agree to that."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"🗽Border, 2nd Amendment, Abortion, America First🗽
👉🏼🐘TRUMP/VANCE 2024 🗽👉💪🏾💪💪🏻🦅🗽🇺🇸🇺🇸"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Kamala = Master of hypocrisy, lies, deceit, obfuscation and misdirection."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She will say anything to get votes
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I never heard Trump say anything about taking away the constitution from Americans, why would he say something stupid like that in the first place."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"In all fairness didn’t Trump say take the guns first, due process later? Does anyone realize Florida’s red flag law has been used 20,000 times?"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"She is the one that said if she had her way, she would follow Australia’s policy of mandatory gun surrenders."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,He never said he wanted to get rid of the constitution…..
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Funny, I never heard Donald Trump suggest taking the constitution away, just democrats.
I'm curious if her interviewers ever smell the booze on her."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,.... The woman is unstable ....
Gf7CtWV1mkY,They push censorship and taking away 2nd amendment rights 🎉
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Scary…
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Any one else see that the Dems blame the right for everything they are doing, like a magician distracting you with the right hand while the left robs you blind"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"“I will suspend the US constitution “ b-but not the 2nd amendment! All other amendments? Yeah, sure"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Straight out of the Karl Marx regime, accuse your enemies of what you are doing, and besides, that’s the stupidest thing to lie about, everyone knows what us republicans think about guns, underlines just how stupid she is"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Colin Noir, I would like a hoodie . Support the 2nd Ammendment"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,So you support a guy that can't articulate well to go against other country's president's that can articulate well. So  this is the guy you want to negotiate for our country.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She not lying about him taking away the 2nd amendment.  Dictators don't want their people to have guns. America is about to get a f around and find out moment.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,When the fuck did he ever say he wants to terminate the constitution of the United States?
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She is such a liar and has no answers!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"honestly i just see her going there as projection, as someone from california i can say kamala is 100% your average california democrat pushing stupid anti gun laws thinking it will make a difference when it wont."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Loved this video, I do want to suggest something though for a video you could do explaining it because I have a friend that's not understanding what he actually meant by what he said. It was about Donald Trump's message to Liz Cheney, ""Put her with a rifle standing there with 9 barrels shooting at her"" and I think they took it out of context trying to make it seem like he actually meant that in a brutal way."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,The desperation coming from libs is palpable. TRUMP2024🇺🇸
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Very intoxicated
Gf7CtWV1mkY,For gods sake will reporters start fact checking this woman.90 percent of what she spews are lies
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Probably, he gave ATF more power to regulate firearm accessories and wanted to take away gun owners due proccess. ATF had no issues with all these things unill Trump demanded they ban bump stocks. ATF even told him they can't, and Trumps basically like, well now you can lol. Thats when ATF started cracking down on all these thing's. Funny how y'all think politicians care about your rights just cause they wear the same gang color as you."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,😂..he already has set behind the seal....she changes to the environment so ahe stands on nothing has no beliefs only has her own agenda on mind at all times.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She doesn’t have the ability to be the president.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She sounds drunk. I lost braincells listening to this.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Actually Kamala is telling what she will do. Ask Elon Musk what will happen to X if Kamala did win.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,JD Vance said it best on the Joe Rogan Podcast when comparing Kamala Harris to his child taking the oreos and then saying Dad took them.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She shouldn’t be president 😂
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Yes he should be. He was and America was awesome
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Dems try and fail to ban guns. 
Trump banned bump stocks after the 240b lit up vegas. 

Just sayin...

I know its over turned and the glaringly obvious choice, but still, stay alert stay alive."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She was asked a question and replied with a different question to ask so she would answer her own question and not theirs?….
Gf7CtWV1mkY,The dems are going to cheat….. she just may win unfortunately
Gf7CtWV1mkY,He should definately be President...not Kamala!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Trump doesn't take...He gives!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She sounds drunk to me.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She talks from both sides of her mouth to fit her political needs.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Save our U.S. constitution.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She's sum yack
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Wow she is a full blown narcissist, i  know this behavior well my mother is also full blown, they lie so damn much they cant keep up with the lie, she trying to say Trump is going take  the constitution away when its really her agenda narcissistic people are incapable of telling the truth even when caught they will double down on the lie ,  Great video"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"""accuse your opponent of what you are doing while you are doing it to create confusion"" -karl marx"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,I also want to say that trump is a AMERICAN born and raised he’s not a government man nor is he a politician or political man which is why he does fumble with what he wants to get out cause u got to realize democrats have a whole ass government that’s telling the face they want us to vote for what to say and do  but also tell her do u and say what u think will get votes as she puts her foot in her mouth then they gotta tele-prompt her foot from her mouth and put it up her ass on camera! Pathetic really but honestly put anyone one of us on stage like trump and see if we don’t fumble tryna do his best to show his compassion and hold back his emotions cause he is crying inside for his country just like the rest of us who loved what this country stood for and absolutely proud to say were an American and now look at us utterly ashamed and so hurt and humiliated making us full of anger and hatred for the government for doing the most horrific things any country could do to its own kind!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,We have the constitution to protect our rights from criminals like her.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"The lady who has repeatedly said she believes the 1st and 2nd Amendment should be compromised repeatedly accuses Trump of eliminating the 1st and 2nd Amendment. And nodding fool Sharpe is happy to play along. Sharpe was a great football player, he's not exactly a Mensa candidate."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,You mean trying to take people's guns.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Why are we even talking about this dumb puppet?
Gf7CtWV1mkY,It doesn't surprise me that she can't read.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,...
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Trump hasn't took anything away.Its her whose taking everything.Vkacjs are done with with this party.You ran out of gas.😅
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Accuse the other side of that which you are guilty.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Great video faM
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Need a translator for both of these people.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She's desperate...
Gf7CtWV1mkY,WILLY BROWN HAD A CALL GIRL THAT HE PROMOTED INTO POSITIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR SEXUAL FAVORS
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I love your podcasts bro. Thanks for keeping the people informed. .  With that said,,,, all that Kamala wants will not be met with anything but resistance from at least this 1 man even if not 1 more stands behind me. No Kamala you will not enter people's homes , no you won't confiscate guns, and no you won't take away free speech. You little tyrant are doing the same thing Hitler did with Nazi Germany.. but it won't be tolerated here."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Lol funniest thing ive heard all year.😂😂😂😂😂
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"She was proposing a mandatory buy back program, which in plain English says a mandatory gun confiscation"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She’s a liar
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Sharp should’ve pushed back
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She sounds drunk.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Read your history
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Colion keep up the fantastic work sir !..
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She lies through her teeth as well as she lies on her back
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Everything she says is what the left wants to do not Donald Trump. Be careful you don’t step in bull 💩…
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Whether we revere it or not?, sounds like you’re playing both sides of the fence 😂."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Preposition H? What is she butt hurt?
Gf7CtWV1mkY,This dumb lady and her administration violated several of Trump's rights.  Biden harris administration committed fraud in the election. They blocked Facebook from revealing the fact the russia collusion was false till after election bidrn harrs admin hid th huntrr laptop fiasco and ALL th Chinese moneys th Bidens received from their Chinese Masters.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I don't believe anything the government tells me....... Nothing!  
*George Carlin*"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"“Just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home, doesn’t mean we’re not going to walk in that home and check to see that you’re being safe and responsible”"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She is the one that said we will come in to your house without a warrant and inspect your guns whenever they want
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Something i & many others have noticed is that demo's keep saying Trump is going to do this or has done that are all things dems want to do or have done, when they say Trump is going to do something i take that as a clear messege that is what they are going to attemp to do, the next democrat that is put in office is going to create the worst conditions America has seen since the great depression, U.S. citizens are not the same as they used to be, the next depression America goes through is going to make zero sense & will bring shame to the entire country & probably lose us allies and any aid that may have come will be haulted due to American dumbassery."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Did she not say she “vows to take effective action on guns if elected”?
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Answer the damn question
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Literally ANY QUESTION SHE CAN’T ANSWER ends up with a redirect to whether or not Trump should be President. It’s pathetic!!!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Colion 2028!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Whats interesting is Harris states that Trump is going to take away the constitution yet from Clinton to Biden that's all they've done.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Seriously….. what a joke she is
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Walz said that free speech isn't guaranteed. Hillary said that ""misinformation"" needs to be censored. Who gets to decide what that is? The only party trying to censor, silence, and jail political opponents is the left. They had Tulsi Gabbard placed on a terrorist watch list because she didn't toe the party line. But President Trump is the fascist???"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Talk to Judge Joe Brown.  Yes, TRUMP should be president. Show me where Trump said that he wants to terminate the constitution."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Just voted for trump
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She’s a SCAM !!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I like how in a conversation of why black people are supporting Trump, she immediately pivots to saying he's going to take away the amendments. Not only is that something he probably can't do, she didn't even fucking address the topic they were discussing! She just started rambling shit that doesn't even matter because it's blatantly untrue."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"“ I’ll always tell the truths, but let me start by lying …” Kamala.😅"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,i like that she was literally installed as a presidential candidate and yet nobody questions it and will still vote for her. The blatant election fraud started before it even began...
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Harris broke all law with screwed up the border. Screwed  up and the flooding due down south .
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"She wants your guns everyone lol. 
She is not in favor of the second"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Yea and she said that they serve purple snails and blue squid at McDonalds when she was there but that doesn't mean its true
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Everything that comes out of a democrats mouth is a lie!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,This guy was just on joe rogan saying he revered the Gettysburg addresses...... for 15 minutes
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Listen to her slurring . She’s full of Xanax
Gf7CtWV1mkY,I'll take my chances. Trump 2024
Gf7CtWV1mkY,The question is why should you be allowed.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,They are the ones that want to eliminate free speech….gun ownership… they are the ones that want to abolish hate speech while being nasty and obnoxious and rabid to anyone that doesn’t see the world their way.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,I couldn't watch this literally 60s in with all do respect f cumala
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Straight up lying, as usual. 
The worst part is there's people that eat up all the BS and are voting blue."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She’s going to accuse him of what she wants to do
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"She sponsored a bill in San Francisco to confiscate people's handguns... not support, sponsored the bill"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She banned even the guns used on her fortnite map
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Sharpie get his HOT CORN BREAD
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Conrad Kamala you're the only person that don't need to be president of the United States Donald Trump Advanced 2024 baby
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"How drunk was she during this interview?

She slurs worse than Joe Biden"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Why is she lying she thinks that nobody listens to Donald Trump
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She shouldn't
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She is literally telling people what she plans to do lol Trump is an American she is not lol
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"There are no limits to the lies of Kamala and the Dems.  Trump did NOT say that he wants to terminate the Constitution, as you point out.  However, Obama, Biden, Kamala, Hillary, and the Dems have actively been working to discredit and destroy the Constitution and the Supreme Court, because the Constitution and the Supreme Court limit the Dems’ ability to achieve complete and total power in the country, and enforce their Marxist ideology.  The lies DO NOT STOP.   Thank you for your clarification of this point.  I could not remember the exact details of what Trump said that is being misquoted.       Joe"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Harris wasn't for regulating Twitter when it was run by democrats for democrats.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Says the lady that said I can take your freedom away with the swipe of a pen 🖊️😳😂🙄.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Bro be on his knees
Gf7CtWV1mkY,There should be some sort of penalty for presidential candidates telling outrageous lies.  She co authored a handgun ban.  She said she would have an assault weapon ban without a grandfather period.  She said trump will keep women from having birth control.  She just makes stuff up and nothing is too outrageous for her to say.  Even pretending she is pro gun and he isn't pro gun.    He was one of the most pro gun presidents we have had.  She is the most anti second amendment candidate in presidential history.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"I hope everybody here understands. Everything Kamala is claiming TRUMP WANTS TO DO. SHE IS DAMN SURE GOING TO DO. She is projecting  is these ideas on him . These are definitely Kamala Harris's plans for you. To remove the Constitution so that you have no rights. Remove the second amendment those that you have no way to protect yourself. There are terrorists in our country now. Anti-air munitions. There are criminals coming from other countries flowing across this border. We are becoming drug bosses. Is there stealing property , are stealing your rights. And you have no way to protect yourself against them..."
Gf7CtWV1mkY,"Lies, lies ,lies kamala"
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Should Harris be able to be the president?? Absolutely not!! Trump never once said he was going to demolish the constitution or he’d take guns away.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,He never sed that you lying bi ch
Gf7CtWV1mkY,I thought Sharpe was smarter than this. I'm saddened.
Gf7CtWV1mkY,This woman’s voice gives me ear aids!
Gf7CtWV1mkY,She's pure evil and lies every time she opens her mouth
Gf7CtWV1mkY,Kamala Harris sucks
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Suburban woman, in CA. I appreciate President Donald Trumps straightforward way of speaking. I voted for him 3 times now. In this election, I'm seeing President Trump in a new light, like we're getting to know the man instead of the business man this time around. I believe women are going to turn out this election, for President Trump. Also, the information we have access to is mind blowing, social media, MSM, we can research so much more than ever before. ❤"
RUjzgTZZp0A,Vance is a weird slimy scumbag.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Why would we vote? They just throw away our votes anyway!?
RUjzgTZZp0A,Is there an email people can contact book studio tours & see where y’all film your YouTube videos?
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Dear Daily Wire,

Thanks for doing Snow White and the Evil Queen. I really support your Snow White. Would appreciate if you also make a live action The Little Mermaid to further humiliate Disney and their lack of creativity because of their woke agendas. I will look forward to your success in the future as well."
RUjzgTZZp0A,WHERE IS THE SNOW WHITE AND THE EVIL QUEEN MOVIE?
RUjzgTZZp0A,Bring back Candace!!!
RUjzgTZZp0A,"It was an even debate. Vance didn’t crush anyone. They both made some good talking points, the daily wire is at it again 😂"
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Remember to thank Israel for its support of lgbtq and pro-choice
Not to mention helping immigrantion into America ♥️🇮🇱💙"
RUjzgTZZp0A,Does Matt Walsh believe Ben Shapiro needs to go to Israel in order for Jesus to come back? I would love to see you two discuss the Christian version of apocalypse together.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Kamala will still win. Don’t be fooled people. The election is fixed.
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Matt Walsh is such a moron. Childcare costs being absurd is the result of ""unmarried people having kids"" what an idiot."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"I would love to watch this video, but Ben Shapiro’s voice is so annoying I can’t take it"
RUjzgTZZp0A,I certainly hope you have enough grapes
RUjzgTZZp0A,"I like Trump a lot, but his climate policy keeps me from voting for him (and I'm not American 😅)"
RUjzgTZZp0A,"When someone keeps saying “trust me” like Vance does, that’s a real RED FLAG."
RUjzgTZZp0A,Repeal the 19th
RUjzgTZZp0A,"JD,...Donald Trump before Congress in 1991 discussing housing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpoA7h6F07I"
RUjzgTZZp0A,"First time listening to this channel, the whole segment. Vance was not prepared for the lost election question. Why did you men ignore the issue? In essence Vance said he would accept fake electors. Has this channel ever discussed the topic of the fake electors? J-6 was a deal breaker for many voters. Trump sat in his office for three hours and watched while Americans fought each other. That is an offense to all law enforcement and the military. That issue and his total lack of integrity is why the Right keeps losing and there was no red wave. Folks that are not used to living in constantly dysfunctional lives are weary of Trump's conduct. He should have never been the candidate this go round. Many conservatives will either vote for Harris and stay engaged or opt out of voting for the sake of their conscience/convictions. IMO."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"I stopped watching the ""DailyWire"" because of Shapiro!!!!.  His actions toward Candace was 100 % disgusting and uncalled for.  I also stopped watching those that are associated with Ben."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"I have not voted for President since 2008. I didn't bring myself to vote for Trump the 1s time around. That has changed, and I fully support Trump now, and he has my vote!"
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Trump opened talks with North Korea, negotiated complex trade deals with China, and hostage releases with places like Turkey. Vance is the better communicator, but he still has a lot to learn in terms of leadership esp on a global scale."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"If kamala wins, i’d love to see vance debate her in 2028 if he runs for president"
RUjzgTZZp0A,That ad read wtf lol
RUjzgTZZp0A,"9:40 Vance opened the debate with statement acknowledging that his mom received food stamps and his grandmother relied on social security to raise him. That plus his GI bill for college means he is not going to have a black and white view of a government safety net. Trump is a born & bred New Yorker who was friendly with Democrats, and decades ago even voiced his sympathies for wanting to be part of a 3rd party. He’s pragmatic and very “real people. right now..” minded -  not some think tank ideologue or philosophical fundamentalist."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Mr. Walz. Extrovert, show man, clown, full of it. Certainly no person to be V.P."
RUjzgTZZp0A,Bull. i’m a suburban woman not voting for democrats. No way in hell.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Great group of guys.  Not sure they had that one guy there though.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Pretty crazy that you can google search this debate and the first 25 or 30 search results are all left leaning news pushing a narrative that walz won this debate..
RUjzgTZZp0A,"JD is Trump's little stooge. A continual non-stop ""yes man""."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"What Vance did really well was just let Walz did his own grave. Gun control is the #1 most losing issue for democrats and Walz blatantly said, ""It's just the guns"". On the abortion thing, Walz refused to say how Vance, the lawyer, was wrong about the bill he signed into law. It was masterfully done. I would have liked to see him challenge the premise of the questions, but I also understand that it's actually a better tactic for persuading independents to just go along with the premise and make the arguments despite the bad premise, which Vance did incredibly well."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"I am one of those California liberals who is voting red this time. Seeing what’s going on in California breaks my heart. Y’all… California USED to be one of the best places in the world. If you had the ability to move to California, you did. Nearly 50 years of liberal leadership (give or take) has absolutely ruined it. The only reason it’s taken this long is because Californians are famously chill about everything. We are sick of our state being trashed. 

Lots of us are leaving… to the point where CA could flip if so many didn’t just get sick of it and move. If we stay and change our voting, we could get another Reagan in office. I just don’t know when though. 

Put some grass roots people in CA and give the HOPE that it will change and it would surprise you how many are ready to flip. Dems can’t control their electorate without California. The only state that could counteract that for them is Texas"
RUjzgTZZp0A,Hong Kong Timmy is a ding dong
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Verify every vote and Trump wins all 50 states. If the left steals again, then its time for class action lawsuits in all 50 states to verify every vote, and any judge that refuses to allow the case needs to be removed and locked up for election interference. Also I foresee Vance/Desantis for 2028"
RUjzgTZZp0A,As a Republican I say get chosen ones out of our party as a voice. These people cover for their own and that makes them double agents in the political field. They don't give two craps about we the goyim and their religion has taught them we are second-class.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Vance is a liar there was no peaceful transition of power.
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Please share;

Titled; cartels, UN, and NGO’s Fuel US Boader Crisis 
Thanks for help sharing and this is one of many"
RUjzgTZZp0A,That is very true because she spent all her money in a lot of people couldn't retire everything was so expensive that we can't afford the food gas in our vehicles and Donald Trump is for the job
RUjzgTZZp0A,Jd ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 love him
RUjzgTZZp0A,JD Vance is very stoic. That seems to be attracting people.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Wonder what was the deciding factor for JD over Ramaswamy? I like them both.
RUjzgTZZp0A,omg the ad 😆
RUjzgTZZp0A,JD Vance theme song: https://youtu.be/vYILYILPrXs?si=95-1_xEDXpo-idAo
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Showing off your wealth here is a little tone deaf (giant bowls of ""food"" that will go to waste and not be eaten). Not offering Am I Racist for paying subscribers of DW content is also angering many. On the edge of dropping my sub."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Trump only has 4 years to F up everyone who has come after him the past 8 years. After that, he doesn't care."
RUjzgTZZp0A,Suburban women would shock your socks off after two glasses of wine - probably pull a Kamala on your 🥒. Just another gaggle of hypocrites..
RUjzgTZZp0A,Nothing like an internet booger.  Dang.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Where’s Candace ?
RUjzgTZZp0A,"No, he didn’t. Stop it."
RUjzgTZZp0A,this was a swing state...5 state debate...trying to appeal to  the voters (the 10%) that havent made up their minds...to give them a reason to vote for trump
RUjzgTZZp0A,Why did we pan out to Andrew picking his nose?? not needed
RUjzgTZZp0A,This show is clearly right wring propaganda and anyone who believes this shit needs to read a book and realize how brainwashy this is
RUjzgTZZp0A,Best ad read I've ever heard in my life
RUjzgTZZp0A,"I’m a woman, 53, with suburban mums as friends. None of us are intimidated by Trump, do not see him as boarish, a womaniser, any of that rubbish. We all see a real leader who can get the job done properly and work for us, the people! He did a phenomenal job the first time, he’ll do the same again. Vance is just as phenomenal."
RUjzgTZZp0A,Klavan are you really a hardcore gamer? 😂
RUjzgTZZp0A,Daily wire is trash. They believe in moderation or censorship.. whichever you prefer which is completely un-American. 1st amendment is to protect unpopular speech.. somehow everyone forgets that. There's always gotta be someone to control the counter movement though. We're at the point when evil people are exposing themselves.. you just have to pay attention.
RUjzgTZZp0A,I havent got around to watching Andrew yet and him calling himself a gamer caught me off guard XD
RUjzgTZZp0A,FYI - I am on ExpressVPM as of Tuesday     /Ben   🙂
RUjzgTZZp0A,Where did he crush him? Vance mostly agreed with Walz. It was like they are on the same side. Especially on socialism 1:30. Vance never said anything about free markets. In housing he’s fine with government building homes. Is Vance really a republican? Where are the values of freedom in his speech? Where is self reliance and opposition to encroachment of federal government?
RUjzgTZZp0A,Are there any left wing influencers you would recommend to watch so we can see both sides of the argument?
RUjzgTZZp0A,Whoever is ahead and whoever has momentum will be the one who wants to be boring and not rock the boat. It is clear that Trump/Vance are ahead and growing.
RUjzgTZZp0A,🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
RUjzgTZZp0A,❤❤❤
RUjzgTZZp0A,"The media gaslit the nation by making Biden seem competent. The debate destroyed that narrative and showed the evil of the media. 
The media gaslit the nation intro believing Vance was weird and extremist. The debate destroyed that narrative and showed again the complicity, bias and evil of the media."
RUjzgTZZp0A,I ad a suburban woman see Trump as being a alpha male...strong and protective
RUjzgTZZp0A,You all did not embrace free speach with the Candice Owens situation.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Duuuuuuuude.... the left doesnt care thtat they extremists and anyone who's still voting kamala  in the center doesn't care either.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Jeremy is dopey. Same with Knowles.
RUjzgTZZp0A,DUMP TRUMP. VANCE FOR PRESIDENT.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Jeremy dump the jewelry it looks figgish
RUjzgTZZp0A,",🙏"
RUjzgTZZp0A,That is a LOT of grapes holy crap!
RUjzgTZZp0A,Imagine if it was Vivek Vance how could they lose?
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Hard to believe reasonable sensible people who will actually vote, haven't made up their minds yet. Unless they just woke up from coma. Or they just learned English. KBC's. Kamala, Biden, Criminals..."
RUjzgTZZp0A,Trump 2025🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
RUjzgTZZp0A,I do remember that G.Bush Jr won his nomination in the course of the duel between Cheney and Liberman. Cheney crushed Liberman both by his knowledge and by his candid demeanor.
RUjzgTZZp0A,"""Disingenuous"". Perfect one word description of Harris. To put it nicely."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Trump is hated for one simple reason….  He can’t/won’t be controlled. Once you understand this, it’s no surprise, Harris is loved by deep state, elitist, and msm shills and grifters."
RUjzgTZZp0A,Love how the camera man zooms in to the guy picking nose at 1:31. unreal.
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Shapiro is way too namby pamby. You or I would've wanted Vance to go to town on Walz's commie stuff--undecided voters don't GAF about that. Walz didn't make himself and Kamala look acceptable, he made them look like amateur hour. No persuadable voters care about what Ben's talking about here."
RUjzgTZZp0A,I still think that Trumps biggest mistake of this entire campaign has been agreeing to debate Biden so much earlier than the traditional timing for Presidential debates.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Why do you let Klaven speak?  Stinker
RUjzgTZZp0A,"No he didn't. 😂😂
He looked like a little school boy, getting outclassed, and disciplined by a teacher.😂"
RUjzgTZZp0A,It was a tie. Don't lie.
RUjzgTZZp0A,"to suburban women: vote for $1.80/gal gasoline, no war, no inflation and win again !! 🏆"
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Suburban woman here - love Trump, always have, always will."
RUjzgTZZp0A,The Klavan ad read was solid gold.
RUjzgTZZp0A,Nice hat
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Vance will be president one day. I may not be here to see it, but it'll happen."
RUjzgTZZp0A,Vance could have gone off since there was no fact checking. He would only be debating Waltz and not 2 vs 1.
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Well if it is all up to “white suburban women” to take Trump to the top, then who cares about the 30% of Blacks who do not support Kamala, as long as Trump wins."
RUjzgTZZp0A,"Doesn’t matter.  Voter shenanigans are returning.  Arizona already caught, no consequences."
RUjzgTZZp0A,JD should be oue president instead of DT
RUjzgTZZp0A,I am pro trump but JD really is the future of the country.
RUjzgTZZp0A,This is bullshit
RUjzgTZZp0A,Tim waltz probably meant to say he’s friends *with victims* of school shooters but let him cook anyway
RUjzgTZZp0A,Didn't walz say he's friends with schoolsh00ters? Yikes
RUjzgTZZp0A,Walz got fact checked so brutal 😂
RUjzgTZZp0A,😂 dont overdose on Copium TrumpTard
RUjzgTZZp0A,Vance has a chance and walz has no bal-
mh4AFUHFomo,That’s MY president 👍🏻
mh4AFUHFomo,Can we take a moment to appreciate how flawless these ad transitions are? Smoother than river rocks i swear lol
mh4AFUHFomo,"Gonna be honest, that line with the stairs on the Garbage Truck, and then the one with the jacket, that was surprisingly good comedic timing.  Even if those jokes happened to writen by a 3rd party, which some would use as a means to dunk on him, the timing and pacing of the quips were really sharp!

Also asking why they love him as a President, it's because it's a 2-way street.  If they love him, he loves them back as supporters, and it creates a feedback loop.  He literally demolished the competition, and to go this far as a quippy defense against the garbage quote from Biden, it probably made his supporters really happy."
mh4AFUHFomo,Absolute legend
mh4AFUHFomo,Trump will never not be the funniest president
mh4AFUHFomo,0:00 i thought someone was calling on discord

mh4AFUHFomo,"A king is no king without his people, but a people without their king would be lost as well"
mh4AFUHFomo,Trump has younger people on his side. Vance. Vivek. Elon. They know about trolling online. That was Trump's advantage.
mh4AFUHFomo,I've had fun from 2016!
mh4AFUHFomo,this aged so well. thanks :)
mh4AFUHFomo,"I love a good knockoff   kislux   because it helps me decide if I want to buy the real thing. Thatâs the part. Thatâs it. I feel like people discriminate against knockoffs, but for me, Iâll pause when buying a trendy big-ticket item or when I feel the over-consumption frenzy is coming for me."
mh4AFUHFomo,"My favorite thing about Trump is that he speaks from his heart and his mind, no teleprompters or memorized pre-written speech’s, just him speaking his true thoughts and opinions 🫶🏻🇺🇸"
mh4AFUHFomo,"I hate ads, but her lead in to them, is pretty spot on."
mh4AFUHFomo,Why did the left convinced me Donald is evil when in reality he’s just like my freaking grandpa 😂
mh4AFUHFomo,"That was genuinely so funny. Actually rolling. 😂

He’s so crazy honest."
mh4AFUHFomo,"2:28 I love what he going to do for this country, but my God you have so much money and he struggle with his foundation as much as I do 😂"

mh4AFUHFomo,Loving that Vivek is learning the truck. If he would have ran all the way he would have had my vote. I voted Trump.

mh4AFUHFomo,Congratulations President Donald Trump  you don't know how happy I am now 🎉🎉🎉
mh4AFUHFomo,"I was just about to leave for school and I saw that clip. I literally just said out loud ""that's such a power move"""
mh4AFUHFomo,This is why instead of just doing guest spots on SNL they've actually had Trump host twice. The man is funny and he knows how to entertain.

mh4AFUHFomo,I like your videos about the election 2024. It's a great Trump- Show with so much fun and humor. I hope he is the winner! Fingers cross and greatings from Germany.❤❤❤❤❤ Sorry for my bad english and possible mistakes but nobody is perfect...
mh4AFUHFomo,1:00 we do a little trolling WHOSE MANS IS THIS
mh4AFUHFomo,"I love your talks very much.

Peter Hitchins on the Times has a different perspective on your presidential election. Outside the US it seems nuts and seems to risk civil war.

US culture is quite different to european cultures. 

Whatever the outcome, the UK will work closely with whichever US administration is elected."
mh4AFUHFomo,"been voting for Democrat for many decades
not this time
Kamala is probably the worst candidate they could come up with
if its Obama or someone with Obama vibes running then this would be a whole different election"
mh4AFUHFomo,Donald Trump is the Keanu Reeves of politicians
mh4AFUHFomo,"We might not have the same political views, but your still so funny and sweet! No matter who you vote for I will still love you❤ also listening to you talk about different subjects is so entertaining. ❤"
mh4AFUHFomo,"The left have to constantly talk about how much they love, and how much compassion they have, because if they didn't talk about it, you'd never know they felt those things, based on their actions."

mh4AFUHFomo,I’m Mexican and I’m proud of Trump
mh4AFUHFomo,I love trump but why is he bright orange 😭😭😭
mh4AFUHFomo,I’m from Ireland so I don’t have a horse in this race but isn’t Trump a convicted criminal multiple times over and he has pardoned convicted criminals the last time he was in office? Or were all his convictions politically motivated by the opposition and have no merit. I just know you can’t even run for government here if you have criminal record. I am Genuinely curious about this subject.
mh4AFUHFomo,"Yo, why's the outro muted?"
mh4AFUHFomo,"“One man’s trash, is another man’s treasure”😭"
mh4AFUHFomo,Instantly liked the video just for the costume alone. LOVE IT
mh4AFUHFomo,There are so many left leaning people that have found a way to complain/make fun of Trump for this stunt (I can’t think of a better word 😅) that he did. It truly baffles me how they can’t see this in their own president 😂
mh4AFUHFomo,"Amazing video as always! Just curious cause at the end I couldn't hear anything and I don't think there's any problem with my audio. Was the final ending clip muted?
Thanks Brett and Daily Wire Team!"
mh4AFUHFomo,"The people who are sticking to Trump are people who would lose their sense of being alive if they quit. They would be cast out of the warm nest of certainty, they would lose their ""family"" as all cult members do when they leave. They would have to start using their eyes, ears, brains again: it hurts to use a body part ignored for a long time, even if it is not a muscle. Finally, some (maybe even most) are honest people who just do not have enough imagination to understand that the ruthless CAN invent things completely, without any regards for the pain they might cause."
mh4AFUHFomo,You forgot the audience for the outro😂
mh4AFUHFomo,when you said the economy is so bad even this guy had to get two jobs had me in cardiac arrest. lol
mh4AFUHFomo,I love your channel BUT I wanna talk about how you transition to your ads because you get me every time with it 😂
mh4AFUHFomo,"19:32
hmmmmmm really Brett? 👀🤰🏻
Did anyone else think what I thought?? 😂"
mh4AFUHFomo,The costume was amazing 😂
mh4AFUHFomo,"You know Brett… i hope you get paid enough and this is better then OF carreers you talk about so much. But as for me personally it’s a tragedy to see your intelect, talent, beauty and spirit wasted into this trash tornado… It’s sad to see you there being a Woman too, but that’s another level.. Seriously think about your future self, values, soul and path and where you are leading kids that are watching you, this is a shame…
DO BETTER !"
mh4AFUHFomo,"Woops, the sound cut out in the end"
mh4AFUHFomo,The difference between genuine (Trump)and “putting on a show” (Kamala)
mh4AFUHFomo,I would have a beer with trump to but he doesnt drink or smoke and i respect him for that
mh4AFUHFomo,Trump is the biggest political troll😂💀
mh4AFUHFomo,"Dude could barely open the door, and made himself look like a fool"
mh4AFUHFomo,Your audio went out in your outro
mh4AFUHFomo,"❤ hi love this garbage trump supporter, energy you go, Brett !!!!"
mh4AFUHFomo,They did not just put the Discord halloween call sound at the beginning you have got to be kidding me 😭
mh4AFUHFomo,Trump 🤝🏼 his team 🤝🏼 his supporters 🤝🏼 TROLLING 😂😂😂
mh4AFUHFomo,u think biden could climb into that truck unassisted like that?
mh4AFUHFomo,I like trump. I voted for him... but the dick riding
mh4AFUHFomo,"can't even stand having political debates with my mother... doesn't care in the slightest how much bad Harris does or how much good Trump actually does, she is just voting because she hates trump. Figure he has the countries interest at heart, and even felt like bringing up how Harris was partying with celebrities' while Trump was helping hurricane victims, but I know that she would hear its trump and stop listening. Just hoping he gets voted in as I doubt America can last under Harris."
mh4AFUHFomo,Impossible not loving Trump
mh4AFUHFomo,"This whole campaign is giving off heavy Gen X vibes which for me, is why it’s so entertaining. We are the generation of sarcasm, smart assery, and shenanigans giving the finger to society 😂💯😂"
mh4AFUHFomo,8:54 He’s invested in this country 😂
mh4AFUHFomo,This has been a fun campaign. Might even miss it when it's gone lol
mh4AFUHFomo,15:19  - I’m going to make my Brett is preggo prediction give it a few months for an official announcement. 📣 📣 📣
mh4AFUHFomo,this is the best persidential run in my 49 years of life. GO TRUMP!
mh4AFUHFomo,"DJT: oi, oi. DJT: oi, oi. DJT: I'm dynamite. DJT: and I'll win the fight. DJT: I'm power load. DJT: watch me explode.  DJT: oi, oi. DJT: oi, oi."
mh4AFUHFomo,trump is making this so entertaining. We are the party of fun and joy. F DEMOCRATS!
mh4AFUHFomo,Brett trying to ease into her ads is hilarious
mh4AFUHFomo,Trump is so hilarious.  That man is in no way an idiot.
mh4AFUHFomo,Fight Fight Fight
mh4AFUHFomo,"Trump, then possibly Vance, then Ramasswey. Weve got the president covered for a long time if they stay genuine and we meep voting!"
mh4AFUHFomo,Brett hormonal….pregnant?!?!? ❤
mh4AFUHFomo,Are you pregnant? All these emotions… 🧐 Excited! 🎉 God bless you
mh4AFUHFomo,"Trump supporters are so biased. Have you noticed it doesn’t matter who trump is going up against, his supporters will hate on them no matter who it is. Whether it’s Obama, Biden, Kamala, etc, and I don’t think we should base the future of our country on biased opinions, fake lies, and someone who will not stand up for our country. Trump wants to back out the war, but he doesn’t realize that if we back out the war, Putin will make us 1st on his list once he claims Ukraine for himself. You realize Ukraine can give either side huge geological advantage in war right? Why do you think both sides are fighting so hard for it? Our tax money is going to Ukraine so that our families don’t have to, I just wish more people realized that. If trumps in office, Once trump submits to Putin, it’s all over, we will be screwed! I guarantee you Russia is not our friend, they aren’t simply going to let us exist just because. In the Russian culture, it is seen as weak leadership to do nothing, or to back down. Putin will come for us if we don’t stop them in Ukraine. For this reason I’m not voting for trump!"
mh4AFUHFomo,"I voted early. Registered democrat, VOTED TRUMP 🫡💪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
mh4AFUHFomo,5:43 liberals could never
mh4AFUHFomo,"You are so much fun to watch and listen to. I'm a big fan of yours, you're a great young woman role model. Keep it up Brett."
mh4AFUHFomo,voted Trump yesterday! 🇺🇸
mh4AFUHFomo,"I love that President Trump gives credit to his team for coming up with the garbage truck idea. If Kamala or Biden were in this situation, they would be taking credit for sure. Not to mention that neither of them would be able to climb into that truck."
mh4AFUHFomo,"Can you imagine pelosi taking out a trash, that will be a Clown show!!!🤣🤣🤣"
mh4AFUHFomo,"I saw the impromptu interview (from the truck) but hadn’t seen the clips from the rally. Those were really funny. “We drove about two feet and then I got out.” “I said where’s my suit? They said it makes you look skinnier!” 😂

I never watched The Apprentice (and can’t stand his speaking style), but I can see now why he’s always been so successful!"
mh4AFUHFomo,You are becoming more and more of a tone deaf joke...
mh4AFUHFomo,She even looks nice in a garbage bag 🤷🏼‍♂️
mh4AFUHFomo,"I mean, it could be said that Trump is doing all this kind of “ normal people” stuff in order to drive his campaign, a little further, but I have for one really don’t care. It’s working ."
mh4AFUHFomo,"So Trump and I have both worked a single day for a trash company, my first day as a temp worker was the day before Covid shut the country down 🤣. MAGA2024"
mh4AFUHFomo,"The left, the Dems, is using scare tactics and lies. And it works bc those ppl are weak and gullible."
mh4AFUHFomo,"The one thing that winning on the campaign trail does is convince people that their candidate will win wether they personally vote or not

Get out and vote!

For the whole damn world!
Im in the UK and the world needs Trump back in the Whitehouse"
mh4AFUHFomo,"To all Americans, I hope that's tea in the cup and not coffee. Greetings from Europe!"
mh4AFUHFomo,I wish someone would have asked him how he got back out of the truck
mh4AFUHFomo,Brett being hormonal and crying at the trump speech… 👀👀
mh4AFUHFomo,I am just waiting to see what’s next. Karmala will give him something else soon.
mh4AFUHFomo,Last night my mom told me she’d kick me out if I voted for trump💀 better start packing I guess lmao
mh4AFUHFomo,"<somewhere in Milan> ""Garbage! So hot right now..."""
mh4AFUHFomo,"I love how this just shows how much of a better president Donald Trump can be. While Joe Biden is calling over half of America Garbage, Trump is out making fries, and riding in a garbage truck."
mh4AFUHFomo,We love you trump
mh4AFUHFomo,"Trump does’nt need to be president as a part nu f his career. He has done and has everything money can buy. He is bullied, he has been shot at and hated by many. He runs for president because he loves his country and the American people. If this was about anything but his love for America and its people he would probably not put himself out there like this. It would not be worth it. I love his humor and his campaign ❤ I am not even an American and I want to vote for him."
mh4AFUHFomo,"3:17 do you know why these democrats are so angry about Trumps Attacks? Because since LBJ the real racist in chief who hijacked the black vote with the biggest bait and switch deception in the history of the U.S, they have demonized GOP as racists and fascists. They attack the GOP with vile lies and aggressive behavior. They threaten and use lies to destroy with October Surprises.
The became Furious when they saw that None of it Fazed Trump and None of it Worked with the public other than their base!
The were jealous that he chose to become a Republican rather than Democrat which he was for years.
He stopped hillary from breaking the glass ceiling that was glass,.lol!
Hillary controls the party for George Soros. In Catholicism you have The Pope who is supposed to be GODS representative on earth.
George Soros is the DNC's god! Hillary is the Pope for the Soros Liberal Communist Church and Obama is their messiah! And the Dragon has given power to these lunatics. Dragon is China who have Dirty Dossier Library to control these puppets. Theyre sick!
The Dirty Dossier Library is Real!
With Trump they had to Invent a dirty dossier. lol. There was nothing they could find so Hillary hires Christopher Steele a foreigner that wasnt a legit thing to do since he wasnt American and interfering in the election with lies that was bought and paid for by Hillary.
The Democrats need an Exorcist! lol"
mh4AFUHFomo,"I hated politics and political campaigns, they were all ridiculous, and stupid, but this is the first time in my life, that I have had so much fun watching Pre Trump's campaigns."
mh4AFUHFomo,Trump was Epstein’s best friend
mh4AFUHFomo,"I am not even ""USian"", what am I even doing here? Oh, yeah: Donald is back in action, baby! Dude, whether he wins or loses, this guy is so much fun!🤣🤗 I hope he runs for comedian once his however-many-years service as President (what's even like the limit in the US?) are over!"
mh4AFUHFomo,"It's not like we've seen Kamala do anything like this, even in the fakest way possible."
mh4AFUHFomo,10:54 He seems approachable? Like you could grab a beer with him
mh4AFUHFomo,It's a garbage trump
mh4AFUHFomo,"Love this podcast! This particular one is so damn fun! It""s REAL, HONEST, AND AUTHENTIC! I FEEL LIKE MY FATHER JUST TOOK ME OUT TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY! 🤣♥️🎻"
mh4AFUHFomo,I love Brett’s reaction to President Trump. She looks like she’s genuinely loving it and having a good time. She is and absolutely beautiful and talented woman. Keep up the good fight
mh4AFUHFomo,"Brett, you should reply to Nick Fuentes video about your facial expressions in this video"
mh4AFUHFomo,And don't forget deplorable! lol
mh4AFUHFomo,00:35 Not the Batman transition. 😂😂😂 Perfect! 🤌
mh4AFUHFomo,Very mindful
mh4AFUHFomo,"Just that simple ""Shit"" sounded more in line with the working class than anything Kamala has said in the last 4 years."
mh4AFUHFomo,Guess I'm garbage for voting for Trump then😂
mh4AFUHFomo,"there was no audio at the very end, God Bless!"
mh4AFUHFomo,Hilarious
mh4AFUHFomo,Trump 2024🎉🎉🎉🎉
mh4AFUHFomo,You are delusional. Trump is a fucking maniac.
mh4AFUHFomo,😂😂😂👍😇🎉
mh4AFUHFomo,I wish President Trump someday would see you at White House! You are a God’s “chosen one” too! We ❤you and keep up the good fight👍✌️❤️🕊️❤️🇺🇸🎉
mh4AFUHFomo,bad video
mh4AFUHFomo,Pregnant
mh4AFUHFomo,I thought you were just dressing like someone from San Francisco
mh4AFUHFomo,I had no idea he cleaned bathrooms at his hotels with his housekeepers. That got my respect in a split second. So many politicians are 'too good' to work the dirty jobs.
mh4AFUHFomo,Does anyone know if goodranchers is halal verified 😅....im tempted
mh4AFUHFomo,I love that he trolls lmao
mh4AFUHFomo,"😂😂😂 love your humor and DJT trolling with McD fries and garbage truck.

Vote No to any propositions to add the right to abortion to your state constitution (CO, FL, MD, NV, NY, SD, AZ, MO, MT, NB, and ME).
Adding it to the state constitution makes elective abortion a right.  
In elective abortion the baby is alive, the pregnancy is not a risk to the mother and she chooses to k*** her baby, this is premeditated m*****.  This should not be a right in your state constitution. 

In all states it already is legal for medically necessary abortions Including
▪︎spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) where the baby has died,
▪︎therapeutic abortion where the baby is alive but the pregnancy is a risk to the mother’s life,
▪︎and in ectopic pregnancy.
In all these situations the obstetrics physician discusses the treatment options and the mother chooses what path to take. True medical choice is already legal.

The majority of elective abortions occur through abortion clinics.  The woman does not speak to a physician, no choice given, is given pills to take and told to go to the emergency room if she has problems.  This choice is what you are supporting with your prochoice/abortion vote.

Abortion in medical terminology is all pregnancy that ends before 20 weeks, at 20 weeks it becomes a birth either born alive or stillborn.  Abortions are either spontaneous or induced which includes subcategories of therapeutic  and elective."
mh4AFUHFomo,"Brett,  I agree with you, I would 100% let Donald J Trump babysit my kids too! Joe Biden on the other hand...H3LL NO!!!"
mh4AFUHFomo,"Great video, thanks."
mh4AFUHFomo,"“You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans.”

The man is a rockstar. 🇺🇸❤️"
mh4AFUHFomo,What kind of turntable is that behind you?
mh4AFUHFomo,"Brett, are you pregnant? The Trump garbage speech is funny, but not that funny. Unless you're more hormonal than usual...."
mh4AFUHFomo,Unbelievable some of my family told me he did the trash man stunt to call the Blues trash😂 They saw it on Telemundo 🤢
mh4AFUHFomo,"Has anyone else noticed joey's eyes have turned from bright blue to dark, sinister, and souless?"
mh4AFUHFomo,"Seriously though, who is responsible for the trash problem in PR?  Is it Biden?  I have no idea. But, maybe the comedian should have made it clear why he brought that up because it really isn't connected to the campaign."
mh4AFUHFomo,"Voted ❤ 100% Red. Dream Team Unite!  A Team!  What are we officially calling it?
I want an acronym for it. A works better."
mh4AFUHFomo,"15:37 Kamala's suits are horrible. We all know what a well tailored, beautiful suit looks like. She obviously has no idea.  I noticed how big the shoulder and shoulder pads are, way too big for her. 

I've worn nice suits and had things tailored. I mean, I'm 55 and under 100 lbs. So, it's necessary sometimes. Ha! 
Seriously she doesn't know how to dress.  She's an alcoholic and overweight, too. Yes, Trump is overweight.  
Hillary wore horrible suits too, that were apparently expensive, but ugly, non-feminine."
mh4AFUHFomo,Rogan said he's hilarious and a comedian. That's a huge compliment from a successful comedian such as Rogan.
mh4AFUHFomo,12:32 Exactly. She's fake. We all know it!
mh4AFUHFomo,"It's great!  He has a great campaign team, obviously.  They knew it would work."
mh4AFUHFomo,‘Put the Tesla in auto drive and let’s watch this video’ 😂
mh4AFUHFomo,Make Campaigning Fun Again
mh4AFUHFomo,"I wasn’t going to vote because my own personal reasons, but after that snide comment made by Biden, I’m going to now. Trump 2024. 🇺🇸"
mh4AFUHFomo,"I Voted Thursday God Bless our 47th President Trump and Vice President Vance, thank you so much for you video, you are amazing hostess!!! God Bless America 🙏🙏❤❤"
mh4AFUHFomo,Every laugh you make at the videos are so fake
mh4AFUHFomo,Nahh he probably made that story up
mh4AFUHFomo,"Honestly, we need more politicians doing regular people stuff. Maybe if they experience what we go through on the regular they’ll be more inclined to make positive changes."
mh4AFUHFomo,"I'm with you, Brett. He is pretty cool."
mh4AFUHFomo,The end of the video doesn’t have audio
mh4AFUHFomo,"God, can politicians stop calling half of the country garbage, deplorable or whatever else? Is not insulting a different political party or voter too much to ask?"
mh4AFUHFomo,Brett have my babies
mh4AFUHFomo,"Democrats have ""joy"" because Biden isn't their candidate. Republicans have joy because Trump IS our candidate."
mh4AFUHFomo,I love how Donald Trump was wearing that vest and driving that beautiful garbage truck. I know that Benny Johnson and Vivek Ramaswamy were driving a garbage truck together as well.
mh4AFUHFomo,"boys 🤝 trucks
saving america🦅"
mh4AFUHFomo,"4:40 seed oil is safe

It beinf unhealthy is a myth. No actual proof for that"
mh4AFUHFomo,"Good to see that the last election we will potentially have was at least this fucking funny. (Regardless of who gets in, like come on man the country hasn't been able to pull together a fucking plan for like 20 years). I will be fiddling as Rome burns personally because there's just not much left to do it seems.

Good to see Ben Shapiro's illegitimate sister kept the grift up til the end also"
mh4AFUHFomo,No matter what they say about Trump he is the funniest president ever! He is the ultimate troller and deserves an award for comedy 😂 Most of all Trump is the most loving and wholesome President ever. He actually cares about Americans and our country.
mh4AFUHFomo,"Honestly can't believe young people like this are happily being spoon fed this rhetoric, a person basing their support off of 'fun' marketing. Go ahead vote for a fake billionaire who bankrupts everyone on a dime, and this whole garbage concept -originated from this guy we wouldn't be talking about it if anyone else was running. That's who you are supporting. Vote for him and see how many people voluntarily lose their lives in the next four years while he smiles and cracks jokes about it."
mh4AFUHFomo,I wish Joe and him talked lot more about all the work the environment and the work the prez did. The Dems put a documentary-type video in yt that depicts him as the worse enemy of the environment and the world really
mh4AFUHFomo,"But... but... but, isn't Kamala the candidate bringing the joy? LOL. I'm dead. This is fabulous. He is epic and truly brings joy--and prosperity--to those around him."
mh4AFUHFomo,I have a really bad feeling that they’ll sell Kamala the election!
mh4AFUHFomo,Hes the best & i cried right along with you!
mh4AFUHFomo,"Just went down a rabbit hole in the comments section. As a neighborly Canadian i was proud to see how many comments were prople from all over the world admiring the Trump campaign and rooting for him to win. Thats true ""diversity and inclusion"". I think a lot of us wish to see these traits in our leaders!"
ITYPetTdCyc,"""we're banning porn nationwide""

*thank you, you saved us*"
ITYPetTdCyc,"it is funny how the so called ""good guys"" support literal murder of innocent babies and labels all men as porn addicts.

I mean most men are not porn addicts so they would be insulted by the label. And the men that are actually porn addicts would not want to think of or imagine Kamala's face while they are looking at porn..."
ITYPetTdCyc,All I could think about when listening to that clip of those two playing Madden was how you could easily take out that audio and it would work without the gameplay. I think that is terrible if you are trying to reach a gaming audience. Already seen YouTubers and streamers struggle to grow their gaming channels and these two are doing what most of them are doing wrong. Would had actually been great to hear them talk about their experiences with gaming and maybe why they like that specific industry and community. Would make them look more human. I swear Trump was able to do that well which is why he won.
ITYPetTdCyc,"No it wont, teenagers are more addicted, not young adults. End of video"
ITYPetTdCyc,they forgot to realize that most guys dont like the porn they watch… its an addiction from easy access at a young age. so yes. ban porn
ITYPetTdCyc,"I'm a gamer. I play a lot, constantly buy games and have even developped them. And even I agree there are problems concerning too much time spent online. Why? Because every reasonable person does. The gaming community agrees on that. It's no surprise. You may love fast food and still know that it isn't good to eat too much of it."
ITYPetTdCyc,"No, no it won’t."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Did anyone notice that since Trump went to court to force democrats to clean up their voters roll, since he had a judgement to remove all illegal immigrant from the roll, since he had a judgement to force democrat to put equal republican/ democrat pole watchers in every county, for some reason democrat lost over 15 million voters compared to 2020, and  republican gained a few million votes. Was the 2020 really a fair election?"
ITYPetTdCyc,The dumbest woke commercials are on your videos.
ITYPetTdCyc,the fact all you have to do is use a vpn to just change your location is funny asf
ITYPetTdCyc,Do they know that Fortnite has guns
ITYPetTdCyc,"I'm glad Trump won. I hope it is banned. It's caused problems for my life and many young men. Ph is banned in Indiana right now. I hope it all gets banned and we can rewire our brains to see how precious women and intercourse really are. Back to the way God intended. And idk if they know, but most men gamers  are conservatives and sick of the dei crap shoved in our games. Also most of us dunk on fortshite. I def won't be playing it anymore."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Soooo no, no it will not"
ITYPetTdCyc,"I'm still holding out hope that Trump, Biden, and Obama will play Minecraft at some point. We're already halfway there, please make it happen. It'd be so funny"
ITYPetTdCyc,That Fortnite map or creative map/mode is against Fortnite’s ToS
ITYPetTdCyc,Nope
ITYPetTdCyc,Here on 11-6. It did not win the election ❤
ITYPetTdCyc,"Well, no."
ITYPetTdCyc,The fact that ”p0rn” is what you think could have won her the election is ironic considering trump slept with one of their stars.
ITYPetTdCyc,From the future: nope it wont 😂
ITYPetTdCyc,At least trump won on a land slide
ITYPetTdCyc,Well...that worked out well for her. lol
ITYPetTdCyc,"The way I heard it Phub would have to do face recognition and social security checks to ensure that it isnt a minor trying to log in. Obviously that is a huge invasion of privacy and they rightfully said ""We aren't gonna do this"". While I think minors should absolutely be protected from this, it should not come at the cost of personal privacy. Sadly at the moment I don't think any kind of compromise will be made."
ITYPetTdCyc,Nope
ITYPetTdCyc,Lot of young people need to touch some grass if those are the two most important vectors that resonate with the voters.
ITYPetTdCyc,The title of the video is crazy
ITYPetTdCyc,Spoiler alert: it didn’t work 😂
ITYPetTdCyc,She advertised ON FORTNITE MOSTLY PLAYED BY KIDS in fact why is there propaganda IN ANY GAME AT ALL
ITYPetTdCyc,You made your editor work overtime for this video 😅
ITYPetTdCyc,The fortnight strategy is indoctrination. They are aiming for the upcoming generation of people for a big push for next election cycle.
ITYPetTdCyc,"Well guys, Trump won. Guess the promise of p$## doesn't compare to the promise of economic stability. Who'd of thought? 🤷‍♂️"
ITYPetTdCyc,“I’m just gonna watch and make sure you don’t finish” is diabolical
ITYPetTdCyc,What a poor attempt at relating to this demographic. This election has made for funny reality tv.
ITYPetTdCyc,"Ah yes, the old ""stereotyping and insulting young men will definitely get them to vote for us"" trick"
ITYPetTdCyc,What’s dumb is a 12 tear could just click “yes I’m 18” and still get into the websites and several states banned the Hub but yet there are hundreds of other sites that aren’t banned and there is also stuff all over Twitter and Reddit. So really “you’re republican congressman” isn’t going to stop you from doing anything.
ITYPetTdCyc,This shows that she ran out of ideas to get people to vote for her.
ITYPetTdCyc,"""Even though we've been putting down men for 10 years""

Lot longer then 10 years lady.  It's more blatant now, but it's been an issue for decades."
ITYPetTdCyc,Pokemon go to the polls
ITYPetTdCyc,Kamala’s Fortnite map sucks so she’s not getting my my vote
ITYPetTdCyc,These ads are spot on with republican overreach
ITYPetTdCyc,Pnc turns men off anyway
ITYPetTdCyc,I’m black and just got back from voting red all the way through.. anyone who watches debates or any politics should know it’s the only real option. Glad they’re still women that care about the country more then killing babies 🎉🎉🎉
ITYPetTdCyc,That is pathetic.
ITYPetTdCyc,That porn ad spells desperation!!! Lol.. 😂😂😂😂😂
ITYPetTdCyc,"This depends on what side you are on. I can understand that abortion and porn are DEFINETLY bad. I mean abortion could be a life saver for some women? Im not sure.
Yeah, Trump might make America better, but WHAT ABOUT EUROPE, THE UKRAINE WAR, LITERALLY THE WHOLE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD.
I dont know who would truly be better, BUT i just would like from you guys, that if Trump wins, come here and tell me what is Trump doing in the world. America right now 'rules'  the world, everyway, economically, military etc. If Trump wins and will get all the American troops and weapons out of NATO countries, Europe will suffer, MORE THAN YOU THINK!
NOTE: Im a minor, this is my oppinion.
If you want to reply to my comment pleaee, PLEASE do it responsably."
ITYPetTdCyc,I play fortnite daily and every fortnite friend of mine will vote for trump!! I dont like when fortnite hates for these stupid politicians
ITYPetTdCyc,Porn
ITYPetTdCyc,I honestly don’t think banning porn is such a bad idea
ITYPetTdCyc,Leftist people are the same people who said beautiful women in games are killing girl gamers. Atleast when republicans ban porn its not because theyre jelous. The left only let porn which they consider 'safe'. The rest they want to censor.
ITYPetTdCyc,I realllllly hope she doesn’t win
ITYPetTdCyc,Here to say Waltz was just a locker room pedo and not an actual coach
ITYPetTdCyc,"They actually think all White men care about is jerking off, playing video games, and partake in the most outdated stereotypes of high school jocks in the 90's. They think White men have no other concerns like the border, economy, providing for their families, and protecting their children from political indoctrination to hate themselves and their country, no no none of that. They also have to say White ""Dudes"" for Harris because to even acknowledge them as men is too respectful and humanizing and risk angering their most fanatical supporters by doing so, so they have to call them dudes, like they are our homies or are basically children. As a White man myself I find their token attempts to appeal to me as blatantly insulting, especially when they say Trump is going to ban porn, as if that is the biggest priority on my mind. They disgust me so much I hope their party splinters apart."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Unfortunately no one cares about fortnite anymore, all they are is an advertisement and no longer for the players."
ITYPetTdCyc,I am so empowered by your articulate analysis. Just subscribed. Great content!!
ITYPetTdCyc,What i find incredibly out of touch is them not knowing that fortnites main demographic and player base arnt even old enough to vote...its like bud light trying to get dylan to peddle their crap to his viewers when the overwhelming majority of them are minors. How are these places so extremely mismanaged now?!
ITYPetTdCyc,"As a gamer that has been gaming for over 25 years now let me explain why the whole ""video games rot your brain"" conversation is bullshit...  video games are extremely interactive and competitive video games make you think on your feet and require you to use an extremely fast thought process on the spot which is the exact opposite of making your brain rot... now if you're smoking a forest of weed while playing then that's another thing, it's not the game's fault you're a brick brained bot... 

About 10 years ago I was a semi-pro gamer (meaning I was playing against pros at the highest level but I wasn't a pro myself) at a sports game (FIFA) and being competitive at such a video game requires extremely high brain usage, it's not muscle memory, you have to think on your feet and especially at the highest level it's nuts how many decisions you make per second. 

Also, video games can be a great way to be social in the right setting. Back in 2012-2016 I was playing Lord of the Rings Online a lot and I was a member of a kinship (this game's variant for guilds). We were about 50 people from all across Europe but we logged on every day and played together, however there were many occasions that we would stop playing and just chat in the in-game chat and laugh for hours... we were all friends... I lost contact with them after 2016 cause I never owned social media accounts (and proud of it) and I had to serve my time in the army, but these are real connections with people... 

Stop seeing gamers as weed smoking dumbasses that can't form a coherent sentence... some are, but these people would be dumb af even without video games in their lives... good video games actually make you smarter and not dumber. 

Maybe instead of video games as a whole, people should go after the companies that make modern games addictive through rage because they all implement unfair systems that artificially make you win and lose games whenever they want to keep you chasing an unattainable dream of ""ranking up"". Maybe ask gamers about the subject since WE KNOW MORE ABOUT IT! Instead of crying about kids playing too many video games, ask what SBMM  and EOMM are (Skill-based matchmaking) and how companies use them to ""protect"" gamers being bullied by better players but in reality they use them to manipulate how much you win or lose to keep you addicted through frustration...  Maybe some politician should actually look at the billionaires of the big funds that have taken over all big video game studios and are preying on kids to suck their money by making games with as many microtransactions and addictive rage inducing implementations within the games as possible... maybe ask the video game devs (developers) how horrible their job has become because they have to work like slaves to pump out a half finished product that is full of toxic themes to induce rage addiction and microtransactions but the gameplay isn't nearly finished and then they take the blame for it... 

It's incredible how people who talk about whether or not video games are good or bad for someone are the ones that DON'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES!!! Ask US!!! Ask the people that actually play them..."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Who needs the hub, when you got Brett Cooper 😏"
ITYPetTdCyc,not old enough to vote but if republicans ban porn they will have my vote
ITYPetTdCyc,Kamala tapping into the gooner vote is INSANE
ITYPetTdCyc,"the ad might be referring to a stance taken in project 2025 that calls for a ban on pornography--but i mean if you like trump, he hasn't endorsed project 2025 so it's still ridiculous to say that he'd do that lol"
ITYPetTdCyc,Tbh wee need more Brett gaming
ITYPetTdCyc,"This honestly gives me depression. I am struggling with a porn addiction and it's really hard. In that ad, it really felt like they were calling me out, like they were mocking me for having an addiction. I would really appreciate if some of you would pray for me in this low point in my life, I really need it."
ITYPetTdCyc,you wanna know how to reach young men? Play gravity falls clips.
ITYPetTdCyc,"Can we maybe get our minds off of talking about campaign ads and, oh, I don't know, talk about fixing global warming, which could KILL US ALL, or is that just propaganda to you followers?"
ITYPetTdCyc,Can every mindless twitter dweller in this comment section just shut up? We don't even know if Kamala approved these ads.
ITYPetTdCyc,"I don't understand why Democrats accuse Republicans of being ""weird"" when this p*rn ad by Democrats seems exceptionally weird to me."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Tradcons are just as bad, u don't care about men and you've ragged on men non stop for the same things? Hypocrite"
ITYPetTdCyc,"Wow, two wonderfully thought out moves from the democratic media team, very cool, very sad, and a little dystopian as fuck"
ITYPetTdCyc,Trump will ban gooning??? 😧😧
ITYPetTdCyc,I don’t want any government funded games like Dustborn. Look it up.
ITYPetTdCyc,"Everything the dems have accused Trump and republicans of doing in the last decade has been things they themselves are doing or planning to do.
Does that mean that Kamala will ban adult content? I think I might've switched to team Kamala if so.

This was the craziest brainwave I've ever had when I put that together. Are dems the thinking man's party after all?"
ITYPetTdCyc,"7:36 Is that not actually Destiny's schtick? He's a human bit of trash with an overlarge head though, so idk."
ITYPetTdCyc,I love this channel even more now with Gravity Falls references 5:21 🎀🙂
ITYPetTdCyc,i bet his crazy wife got jealous
ITYPetTdCyc,"that's a ""the it crowd"" clip, FUNNY show"
ITYPetTdCyc,"How about let's see Brett and Her Husband, play games against Reagan and Her Husband?"
ITYPetTdCyc,What is more interesting is that a surprising amount of Adult Entertainers are backing Trump. They believe in what Trump wants.
ITYPetTdCyc,Conservative gamer since I was 18. The stakes seem higher than ever this time. It's too bad in NYS my vote feels pointless.
ITYPetTdCyc,Yeah i WISH anyone was trying to ban all p*rn.
ITYPetTdCyc,Gaming? You think that taking guns out of Fortnite was appealing Kamala?
ITYPetTdCyc,"Today watching Mr beast on youtube and ad kept popping up with two young men speaking about how Trump is going to raise income tax & vote for kalama. 🤣 of course at the bottom it said ""not paid for by kamala"". Lol yeah I'm buying that"
ITYPetTdCyc,"if a kid wants to watch ""corn"" they will lie about their age."
ITYPetTdCyc,Tim is trash at Madden.
ITYPetTdCyc,"It's already ""technically"" illegal to watch porn under 18, but no one enforces that. All you gotta do is click on the ""I'm over 18"" button and boom, anyone can watch it. 40 year old man on a pc, or 7 year old child on an ipad. It needs fixing. Immediately."
ITYPetTdCyc,She’s the worst candidate for president in the history of this country
ITYPetTdCyc,"I voted for Biden in the name of internet privacy and net neutrality and I'm voting Kammala for control of my body to not go to the states and because nobody wants to compromise their privacy just to jack off, they may take our guns but they will never take OUR P**N!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
ITYPetTdCyc,Cumala Harris at her finest
ITYPetTdCyc,Say young man don't be stupid say young man vote for Trump say YOUNG MAN DONT FALL INTO THE LIBERAL DUMB RABBIT HOLE SAY YOUNG MAN
ITYPetTdCyc,Now I play Fortnite all the time but I will never support her or her maps what so ever ❤❤
ITYPetTdCyc,"“The Party told you to ignore the evidence of your eyes and ears. 
It was their final and essential command”. 
George Orwell."
ITYPetTdCyc,We don’t want politics in our hobbies
ITYPetTdCyc,"Who the fuck I’m sorry, but I want video games. That is the worst way to reach your supporters."
ITYPetTdCyc,The folks playing Fortnite aren't old enough to vote... swing and miss.
ITYPetTdCyc,"Gaming definitely won't win them the election. Concord, Dustborn, and Dragon Age: Veilguard have shown how gamers feel about the leftist agenda. Especially with how well Stellar Blade and Black Myth: Wukong have sold in comparison while rejecting that same agenda. As for... the other stuff. It's the internet, people will find it if they want it."
ITYPetTdCyc,Right wingers or right handers😂😂
ITYPetTdCyc,"If you have a vpn, it wouldn't matter what state you're in?"
ITYPetTdCyc,Kamala / Walz should try a cod lobby. That'll open their eyes a bit....
ITYPetTdCyc,"As a young man, I despise the way that Kamala talks to men. Her campaign ad comes as no surprise though since Kamala slept her way to the top."
ITYPetTdCyc,Cringe. The guy says he's gonna wait to make sure he doesn't finish.  They really think so little of us.  It's insulting.
ITYPetTdCyc,Been playing black ops six and all the clan tags are Maga and Trump
ITYPetTdCyc,Ironically this makes Trump look more grown up than they are XD
ITYPetTdCyc,"So far, the people I see wanting to vote for Harris, I wouldn't consider ever picking up a video game (like the whole demographic). I keep hoping some hacker will come in, find a way to get guns on the island ... making a perfect point"
ITYPetTdCyc,"Left wing ads: ""Join us and you won't last 3 seconds""
💀💀😭"
ITYPetTdCyc,I resonate. I felt the same about the McDonald's ad. What are these two candidates 😮‍💨
ITYPetTdCyc,I mean if they’re targeting Fortnite players most of that demographic can’t even vote and are obsessed with sigma skibidi toilet edits. Most young men vote republican and it won’t change and that’s why they are trying to target that audience and it won’t work
ITYPetTdCyc,I'm sorry but in Europe we call host like you a paid one. How can someone criticize one person for p*** involved ads and in the same time forgets that the other person had closer encounter with it😅.Can't you americans be normal and just hate both of them 😂
ITYPetTdCyc,"How dare they sully the Buffalo Bills by playing them!
    sincerely- The Bills Mafia"
ITYPetTdCyc,"I'm prochoice, but HOW without terminal conditions would anyone's support it after the child can already live outside your body without you?😢"
ITYPetTdCyc,I don’t always agree with Brett but on this one I can agree. 😂
ITYPetTdCyc,they really do have NOTHING else to try and save them. do they realize MOST PQRN IS TRAFFICKING!? that's all of a sudden okay now?? the events of 2020 will probably occur again because they know they wont win. i pray for this country
ITYPetTdCyc,"So, porn is sexist, porn objectifies women, porn is problematic, yet it's bad if republicans ban it... Just goes to show they have no principles."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Ew.
The button that agrees 
👇🏼"
ITYPetTdCyc,"Hot tip just call ""P"" corn 🌽 no censorship issues when you talk about veggies 😋"
ITYPetTdCyc,"The thing he doesn't understand is the people used in that playbook are fully trained professional football players, that are fully prepared to make that play. And if they arent fully prepared, or have an injury, or had other things to focus on; they generally DIDNT play.

So what im saying is, DONT HAVE SEX UNLESS YOURE READY FOR A KID! You arent prepared for what that game is going to bring, you cant cheat the game by making your own rules and regulations. The rule is you have sex, you have baby. Thats it. Not ""I have sex for fun, and have no baby instead"". In any game you play, you play by the rules. And anyone who plays the game generally is always trained for it and ready to take it on. Making the connection between planned parenthood and football playbooks is about as retarded as comparing a Grilled Cheese to a Rock because theyre both salty. 

Not only do they not understand our hobbies. But they dont understand us, or the core nature of what theyre making up. ""Oh having planned parenthood is just like a football playbook, even though football players planning is based on training and health, and baby killing planning is based on avoiding the training and health of the baby, by subverting its conception with death chemicals. How can you literally compare the two when YOU AVOID BEING A GOOD ENOUGH PARENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU ARENT READY!? So instead youd rather kill a life YOU conceived by playing a game YOU werent ready to finish? You made your choice when you said ""Dont pull out"" and pulled his hips in. You dont get to make the choice of another person; i.e the one thats growing inside you. 

Unless you never agreed to have intercourse, or you have the possibility of dying during birth; you have no choice. You should've been trained, prepared, and ready to be an Adult before you played the Adult Game. Once you have a child and raise it, and make them a great person with good guidance, then you can be called an adult. Until then, you havent proven a thing. All you've proven is you like to subvert reality to fabricate your own. And if that isnt delusional, I dont understand what is. These people are insane."
ITYPetTdCyc,AOC can run a mean pick six
ITYPetTdCyc,"They should’ve just played subway surfers at the bottom of the screen 😂 would’ve been way more effective than this, this just hurts"
ITYPetTdCyc,"Brett, I hope you don’t wake up one day 40 years old, tired and wondering what life could have been like if you hadn’t rushed into marriage like your parents wanted, building this conservative persona to gain validation from old people, and instead spent your adolescent years exploring who you really are. Getting all caught up in politics is a tragic waste of one’s youth."
ITYPetTdCyc,I see a lot of trump gamertag/ID not harris
ITYPetTdCyc,Thats crazy.
ITYPetTdCyc,there is nothing bad and wrong with porn hub and wanking
ITYPetTdCyc,LMAO My god i can't wait till she loses. She's the worst candidate not voted into running the Democrats have ever had 😮
ITYPetTdCyc,what is wrong and bad with porn and wanking
ITYPetTdCyc,u r right
ITYPetTdCyc,Funny how the old guy in the add looks exactly as his VP candidate...
ITYPetTdCyc,The Democrats have turned America into a hellhole 😅😅😅😅
ITYPetTdCyc,"Wow, Kumala sponsored a trash map which nobody wanted to play on for a GHEY, trash game."
ITYPetTdCyc,How much of the money given to PreBorn actually goes into preventing baby deletion?  How much goes to bloated pay checks??
ITYPetTdCyc,"The title is rather dumb IMO.  AOC, Kumala and Walz are such losers and so inauthentic.  It's very obvious they are fake, they are just acting.  The ads are total trash and anyone who is swayed by them is an idiot."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Hmmmmmmmmm …. Everything they say Trump is doing They Do It not even caring that we can see it!!!

So that with other obvious things we already know they want to censor… free speech etc… I think THEY will limit internet content … like TamponTim’s favorite country, China!"
ITYPetTdCyc,You do realize that they’ve already picked the president way back.  The voting is the humor the people.   They know he’s gonna be president way before that.
ITYPetTdCyc,Hmmmmmm spanking it and Kamala in the same thought…. Icky!!!
ITYPetTdCyc,"Sorry, we young men grew out of that phase a long time ago. Now we care about getting ripped, meditation, eating healthy, and getting money. Nothing can stop us, and knowing our purpose."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Somebody I know shared with me what p**n did something horrible to their family. There what a family who had a young lady who they were very proud of, she dressed modestly,she was very kind and respectful to her parents. Out of no where the family started having issues. One being that their daughter started doing a 180, she flipped. She was no longer respectful,she started dressing extremely inappropriate, and she no longer had respect for her parents. So the family reached out to my friend. They tried to help them figure out what was the issue, why it seemed satan had a hold on their daughter. Eventually they found out that one of the men in the family was involved in watching and using p**n. P**n is by no means a positive thing, like Brett has said time and time again. Not only is it disgusting and a serious addiction, but it also lets things into your home. You never know what you are doing or what you own is letting demons and satan in your home. This world is no joke."
ITYPetTdCyc,brett can you please respond to the sexual assault claims against trump
ITYPetTdCyc,"respect the effort but that ""just kidding"" ......."
ITYPetTdCyc,Im an avid Fortnite player or really im a gamer period and I dont watch pron but I play lots of video games but Im also not a lazy sack of garbage but anyways i just wanna say Fuck Kamala 2024 also not playing Freedom Town
ITYPetTdCyc,Anyone with a brain knows how to download a VPN to watch anything they want.
ITYPetTdCyc,"And still people voting for her. 😂😂😂 seriously, they just hate trump so bad, they will go for a garbage kamala 😂"
ITYPetTdCyc,Porn should be banned. Its destroying relationships. The democrats don't actually care abortion abortion. They are using porn and abortion to lower the population.
ITYPetTdCyc,I promise you if they played Fortnite little 8 year old Timmy would thrash them verbally to the point they’d ban Fortnite 😂😂
ITYPetTdCyc,So net neutrality has entered the election chat I see. Again people wouldn't let this happen and the online actors would agree more than the pervs that watch them
ITYPetTdCyc,Make America great again. Ban porn
ITYPetTdCyc,Porn might
ITYPetTdCyc,"Man, i wish Republicans wanted out right wanted to ban porn but it's never gonna happen."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Kamala says in interviews that she’ll close the border, why then doesn’t she put it in writing on her campaign website? She doesn’t write the words “closing the border/illegal immigration” once. Zero times. I think she’s lying and will bring another 20 million illegal immigrants in if she wins, and that will be the end of democracy because those 40 million potential immigrants will always swing the vote towards the democrats. The liberal democrats plan is very simple and they’re using the law to rig the system. You don’t have to like Trump to agree that he’s the safer option. He’ll make America much much safer, as he did in the past. He’ll also get the economy back in shape. Trump wants LEGAL immigration, a safe border, and a better economy. He’s done it before and he can do it again if he’s given the chance."
ITYPetTdCyc,"If trump made a fortnite map. It'd be packed out. Literally, crash the servers packed. Just because he's an eternal memer. But part of why we're voting for him, is because he DOESN'T do stuff like that."
ITYPetTdCyc,That p@rn ad will probably have the separate effect. Most men know that porn is doing them no good.
ITYPetTdCyc,No. Most dudes on porn & games are conservatives or kids 😂😂😂😂😂😂
ITYPetTdCyc,"If you have to play video games to promote your campaign, that is sad. For a podcast it is ok because a podcast is for entertainment. I disagree with trying to connect with men by playing video games, a strong candidate should lead men to convince them to find other more productive sh** to do with their time than play video games. This is why you will not see Trump doing something like playing video games, he knows this."
ITYPetTdCyc,"The irony is, if guys like us are more into p—n and gaming, it’s because these lunatic lefty women are so uptight about “icks” and “micro aggressions” that we’ve decided it’s not worth putting ourselves out there."
ITYPetTdCyc,"Let’s get Trump playing in Freedom Town! I’d pay to see that, even better lets have him 1v1 Kamala, lets she her put her money where her mouth is for once"
ITYPetTdCyc,"Trust me, even if the government bans p*** adult who want to watch it will find a way"
ITYPetTdCyc,"Hey fellers question, can you donate  to preborn in Canada?"
ITYPetTdCyc,The porn ad is not a Kamala ad.
ITYPetTdCyc,"Abortion should be a human right but definitely discouraged. Still, I don’t think fetuses are sentient beings anymore than a plant is"
ITYPetTdCyc,"The porn laws are pretty wack ngl, but that’s the least of my worries this election season. The lunacy of the Democratic Party has gone on long enough"
ITYPetTdCyc,Video games are a plague to most. Only a few good excuses I’ve heard for them. Porn doesn’t bother me much but lots of guys are a lost cause
ITYPetTdCyc,New Slaves type beat
ITYPetTdCyc,"LOL, it reminds me of Azerrz channel, where he impersonated Trumps voice while doing COD. It was hilarious and so fun. A legitimate reaction for a trump supporter."
ITYPetTdCyc,"if Kamala wins anyway after all this crap.. the rest of the world, including me, will be very disappointed by you americans."
ITYPetTdCyc,mf took the guns out of the game mode as well 💀
ITYPetTdCyc,"started watching when I was about 11 ish. Was heavily addicted to the dopamine high and spent years trying to break from it... sadly still trying, but taken massive steps in the past few weeks when I decided I wanted to raise a catholic family. Would rather it be heavily restricted, requiring verification, but some sites still don't require verification despite Texas laws requiring otherwise..."
ITYPetTdCyc,i liek the ban its been forcing me ( a younger male 13) to not go there… and slso if im yk down bad id be harder to go around cus i got parental comtrol on my devices .so its js stopped me from doing anything of the sorts which i love😭💕A lil vent Hope my job applicsnt doesnt find this….
ITYPetTdCyc,real gamers are voting trump. only lil kids and streamers play fortnite.
ITYPetTdCyc,Kamala is expired
ITYPetTdCyc,BS fact check
ITYPetTdCyc,"Not surprising she is trying to attract voters with p*rn considering she slept her way to the top. May as well call her the Philanderer in Chief.

On a minor note, any gamer could've told you Madden sucks and ain't the way to go. Couldn't even get that right."
ITYPetTdCyc,Aoc said at this point just show her badonkadonk because that's the only wish you would even get votes for her
ITYPetTdCyc,"I’ll tell you this now, those who are playing Fortnite probably aren’t old enough to even vote."
ITYPetTdCyc,I am playing madden rn
ITYPetTdCyc,Turned my ballot in over by my local sheriffs office over a week ago. LGT!
ITYPetTdCyc,The porn industry attracts the lowest of the low. What candidate wants to support rape non consensual uploads and sex trafficking these companies like pornhub thrive on?
ITYPetTdCyc,Miss Brett needs to play Space Marine 2
ITYPetTdCyc,Kamela is so delusional on how men actually are… she’s going for the weirdos cause she knows she ain’t getting the men trump supporters WHO WANT REAL GOOD CHANGE NOT THEE ABILITIE TO WATCH PORN😂😂😂😂
ITYPetTdCyc,"Fortnite, owned by Epic Games, owned by Tencent, owned by the CCP.  Gee, I wonder why Kamala/Walz would pick THAT game to ""play""."
ITYPetTdCyc,"""Hhey guys! You know those things that are holding your life back and destroying your concept of healthy relationships?? 
We want you to do more of that!""
-Kamala Harris....probably"
ITYPetTdCyc,"Ironically making a based ad, lmao. Make shaming goomers great again."
ITYPetTdCyc,P*rn should be banned. But Iam willing to end at all p*rn being paid only noo free p*rn.
ITYPetTdCyc,well it is no nut november
ITYPetTdCyc,"ARRIBA, young lady!"
ITYPetTdCyc,"If prawn is your biggest concern now, we truly were better off having to chop our own wood for warmth."
ITYPetTdCyc,Does anyone knows how to find the full ad?
ITYPetTdCyc,Her whole campaign is based on catering to people's vices.
ITYPetTdCyc,Hopefully men won’t vote for her!
ITYPetTdCyc,You know democrat will make american collapse
ITYPetTdCyc,Even if Republicans are trying to ban p*** id still vote for em.
ITYPetTdCyc,Well it didn't help you that's why your now an alt-right grifter.
ITYPetTdCyc,"So you can use the word shit on YouTube, but not p***?  Some standard."
ITYPetTdCyc,I'm not an American but I genuinely would have no problem with porn production being banned and anyone who uploads porn to the internet be taken straight to prison.
ITYPetTdCyc,in the next few days we will figure out if we are going to WW111 or have lower prices on groceries 💀
ITYPetTdCyc,"Omgoodness, cringe, embarrassing, and absolutely insulting."
ITYPetTdCyc,The guy playing the Republican congressman looks a lot like Tim Walz.
ITYPetTdCyc,"As a gamer and a stoner 😂 and trust me no gamer is voting for her during gamer gate 2 😂 the devs and all 30 members of the ""moden audience"" but definitely not gamers."
ITYPetTdCyc,This is the party that wants to disempower and numb young men.
ITYPetTdCyc,Is this how they perceive masculine livelihood? Pathetic.
ITYPetTdCyc,men watch porn but I'm not that sure men really want to watch porn all that much.
ITYPetTdCyc,"Who is even watching porn rn. Come on, we are only three days into No Nut November"
ITYPetTdCyc,"When 9 year olds have pr0n addictions, clearly we need to do a better job of regulating this stuff. Anyone who is against age verification for pr0n gives groomer vibes tbh"
ITYPetTdCyc,She is truly employing such deplorable tactics that I question why anyone would even support her in first place. I mean she actually is in favor of everything that is destroying our society.
ITYPetTdCyc,She told us that young people are stupid
-cln1whltnc,"The 2028 election will be more difficult. No Republican candidate has the airplane to run 900 rallies in six months like Trump. To attract the votes of Democrats, they deadly want a female president, but Tulsi must not want to replace Vance. I am afraid that let her be VP will not be attractive enough. If She get more limelight than Vance, Left will alienate us. In addition, both of them should be less powerful than Trump in attracting donations.
Suggest  everyone save a donation fund now. Personal donations cannot exceed more than $3,000 , and put aside $3 every day. At that time, we will donate to whomever Trump recommends, so that America will continue to be great."
-cln1whltnc,Hopefully like the swamp will be drained completely this time
-cln1whltnc,"She was saying she won't be anything like what's gone on while also saying everything that had been done was great and she was all for it. Cognitive problems are an understatment, he wasnt there in 2020, and now he's out of it."
-cln1whltnc,Go cuz
-cln1whltnc,"Virtually all of Jordan Peterson's videos are meaningless for ""Targeted Individuals"" (TI, directed energy weapons, gang stalking, ect.)."
-cln1whltnc,"Yeah, Thank you very much Jordan Peterson"
-cln1whltnc,❤️
-cln1whltnc,"""Dr Evil"" just decided one day that Biden was to go, and then he was gone. :D"
-cln1whltnc,Trump even won the popular vote. :D
-cln1whltnc,"Inflation came from sanctions of Russia, screwing with China, and the costs id the Ukraine war. So west actually screwed itself."
-cln1whltnc,Biden is soon Byegone. Thank God!
-cln1whltnc,How find her in social media people pls?
-cln1whltnc,"Dr.Sam i have always known that he's a democrat.
But the Democratic party has just lost common sense and misinformation is on both sides though The Left always inflames what Trump says."
-cln1whltnc,This is so dark actually to put a man in such a state into such a position. People using you as some kind of doll.
-cln1whltnc,"Well, the thing is, the Deep State wanted a party full of puppets who would sign this, sign that, and not ask questions. The Deep State knew full well of Biden's cognitive decline before he took office; they have the best doctors in the world. Do you think for a second they weren't aware? They were. It was all done by design, and they failed in spectacular fashion."
-cln1whltnc,Wow amazing
-cln1whltnc,Now there will be Trump cabal
-cln1whltnc,This wait to take office is tediculois
-cln1whltnc,"Dr. Peterson please do a new interview with Pierre Poilievre.
Our country needs the help…."
-cln1whltnc,"05:05 ""brain surgery may have been a factor...""  YOU CAN'T HAVE SURGERY ON AN ORGAN YOU DON'T HAVE."
-cln1whltnc,"In big politics, everything is deliberate. The cabal let Biden do the speech without the big med. to keep him cogent, so the left could remove him from the ticket.  How do all the followers of the left, let them get away with so much corruption. Joe was not there 4 yrs ago which is why he was kept in the basement.  3 years of false collusion, raiding Pres. Trump's home in the night, etc. etc.  No one on the left speaks up about the illegal ways of getting rid of a political opponent.  20 X worse than Watergate!  Wake up people!  Clear your hateful minds.  Left has been great at creating false hatred and division!"
-cln1whltnc,"We the People did it, Dr. Peterson. Thank God! Western civilization is safe for four more years until the rats come back."
-cln1whltnc,This lady looks like if tulsi and Harris did a dbz fusion dance
-cln1whltnc,So names of those in control The Biden/Harris team are….
-cln1whltnc,Thanks so much for bringing these ideas into focus. So many people do not seem to grasp what the Dems have been doing.
-cln1whltnc,I wanted to hear you say it! Cause I probably would have agreed with you!
-cln1whltnc,"The Dems are busy stabbing each other in the back in plain sight. No morals. No ethics. No principals. Even with all the constant mainstream media gaslighting, did they really expect the electorate to trust them.......again?"
-cln1whltnc,Dr Jordan we need you to educate us on how we are going to deprogram our daughters...they are suffering so
-cln1whltnc,Wait a minute but the citizens of America have a strong economy. Powell has been saying everyday that Americans are doing well and are resilient in the economy. Life is all good.
-cln1whltnc,Migrants flooded over border? Biden/Harris administration open borders and let migrants to come in with no restrictions! Only idiots can’t understand that and vote for Harris!
-cln1whltnc,Thank YOU so much for your contribution ❤❤❤
-cln1whltnc,Comment
-cln1whltnc,I work in aged care.  His stiffness and gait suggest parkinsons.
-cln1whltnc,JUSTICE FOR PEANUT!!
-cln1whltnc,Thank you soooo much  Jordan for helping us all with the elections. Hopefully we can find a way to make things better! Lots of love from our family to yours ❤
-cln1whltnc,They eat their own.
-cln1whltnc,What a lot of garbage this is.
-cln1whltnc,This is a great listen
-cln1whltnc,"Importantly, How do we De-program the Marx indoctrination? We need some neo Macarthy-ism!"
-cln1whltnc,Its wasn't biden she needed to distance herself from!  It was his puppet master!  Obama.   He swooped in and told kamala to not answer any questions and to simply bash TRump if any questions came up!   Brilliant strategy 😂😂😂
-cln1whltnc,What I have been thinking we need to take his driving license and put in place the newly elected president. She wasn’t elected
-cln1whltnc,10 -20 million people. That's insane. Just lock in permanent votes.
-cln1whltnc,"Question is how is still president? He should let her be pres for next couple months, good on her dei resume."
-cln1whltnc,So infuriating Biden isn’t removed from office. He has full blown dementia. Why is he allowed to hold the highest office?!? Liberal media is completely complicit in supporting the dems.
-cln1whltnc,"If aliens come to earth and want to speak to one person and one person only, you're my candidate, Dr Peterson. This is an insightful interview. You speak nothing but pure logic. Your questions are on point, and this guest was a great pick. Keep up the good work."
-cln1whltnc,Dr. Peterson (Jordan) - Thank you very much for helping to enlighten the U.S. voting public!
-cln1whltnc,"Trumps literally gunning for fascism and Peterson the ""great defender of freedom"" is silent. The Maga movement is literally the biggest threat to western democracy and freedom at the moment, and Jordan couldn't give a fxxx"
-cln1whltnc,"I wouldn't be surprised if Kamala invoked the 25th amendment. Democrats have been so hell-bent on getting a woman president, while also propping up the most terrible candidates to do so, that they deserve to get one in the crappiest way possible with a really short term."
-cln1whltnc,Biden didn’t win they cheated
-cln1whltnc,"The woke Diddy-crat voters gets a free ride to the next 4 years of peace, great economy, border security, healthier foods, and common sense. But I assume they'll still complain. When will they wake up?"
-cln1whltnc,"God bless you Jordan Peterson for being a voice to many, to get ppl thinking, and help encouraging young men to step up in their lives. This Trump win and hopefully slowdown/stop of forced/compelled woke speech is in part bc you werent afraid to ask questions, and seek truth, and wrestle with the hard questions of life

i know when you were sick and away, was praying for your recovery. Appreciate all you do!"
-cln1whltnc,"No matter whose side you're on, you're not getting anywhere without trust and compassion. And it must exist on both sides. The choice is ours 🌲🌲"
-cln1whltnc,Trump has won. I think she will fall into the background now. It will be some time before this kind of Marxist policies will be able to rear their head after this large loss :)
-cln1whltnc,MAGA baby
-cln1whltnc,"Hmm, so far A LOT of what she's saying needs to be fact checked. The US really didn't ""fold their arms and stay silent"" re: the Middle Eastern war, they've declared a particular stance...
It would be great to have more researchers/ analysts discuss this particular topic on this channel, but - hey ho!"
-cln1whltnc,"Obviously, the modern people have a huge problem with a associative memory and links inside their brain. Bion once wrote nice article about this phenomenon -  ""The attack on links"" that describes the reason of schizophrenia by the way."
-cln1whltnc,huge dislike to this person in blue
-cln1whltnc,Iran first attacked Israel!!! Is this a sister of Putin? The same sick logic and psychopathy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-cln1whltnc,"Money is a form of energy, that gets directed, to take care of the intentions of the people with money, who send the money into the world. Money is intentional. It prioritizes the energy in the economic system, in politics. Knowing who spends money tells you, of the shape of things, where the energy goes, how it shapes our world. It has a telos....intensionality. The best way to fix politics is to enhance the telos of the underclass:

Very large tax donations, based on economic class, income, wealth. 

Huge tax breaks for people in lower economic stratas.....if they donate to a political party of their choice. Coupled with very large restrictions on donations from the wealthy, no tax breaks, large prison sentences for illegal influence. 


Money is incredibly concentrated in the economy. Like in the video, ""50 Families Buying the 2024 Election."" Ana Kasparian. Also strangely it has to do with gender & sex and getting laid. Ever notice most adds on TV target women, make men look stupid? It's intentional....telos.

Lets you know, who controls the money, who has power, energy. How can that be, most ads targeting women, making men look stupid, when women earn 70 cents on the dollar, for what a man earns? Well...men like to get laid. Women decide who gets sex. Women choose men to have sex with, based on his financial ability. She controls him, he gives her, his energy, his money...his telos.

Works the same way in monkeys. Videos online. Boy monkeys bribe girl monkeys with fruit, for sex. The economy is about men pleasing women, to get sex. So is Global Warming. Consumer spending drives economic growth...telos. Women control that economic growth, by controlling sex....telos. Control telos, you control The Rich Men, North of Richmond.

Capitalism & the ""free market"" is men, giving women money, for sex...then women buying stuff they see on TV. And even that is concentrated along class lines: About 70% of the economy is consumer spending, women spend 85% of consumer spending, but it's even more concentrated: 80% of all female consumer spending is by females in the top 20% of income. You know, the Karens who lecture us about Global Warming, fly off to Hawaii with Leonardo di Caprio, for a Global Warming Conference.  They are the ones driving the economy, driving Global Warming, via the use of their directed financial energy and choice in the economy. 

Same things in politics & donors."
-cln1whltnc,"They drugged him real good...  hihi  😂  Even then, during the presidential debate, they gave him something not so good! hahaha  🤣"
-cln1whltnc,Are these people even human? The true rulers of our world? It amazes me people would follow such crazy rules like immature children that feel they must listen to someone based on a title. What kind of power are we actually having to bow down to?
-cln1whltnc,"I am 61 years old. NATURALIZED in 1975. Born in 1964 in Naples Italy.  I have Know That Joe Biden, was a malevolent Idiot since I was 15 years old. What did AMERICA  MISS??"
-cln1whltnc,Get ready for the Trump train! 🚂
-cln1whltnc,Key stone pipe line stocks too increase
-cln1whltnc,Trump 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 resurrected !
-cln1whltnc,Who knew? An inside Job(s) from b@ckstabbing Kamela. Excellent reporting!
-cln1whltnc,The deep state was running the USA
-cln1whltnc,"More of Miranda. She's an encyclopedia, though sometimes slow on the uptake."
-cln1whltnc,Senile old Joe only had a slim chance of winning in 2020 and they cheated him in.
-cln1whltnc,what are you trying to say?
-cln1whltnc,WOW.  Great interview.  That Steve Job's widow is Kamala''s best friend answers some of my questions. $$$$  Why isn't anyone asking WHO has been running the government for the last 4 years.  .......bankers ?  CIA ?  Bilderbergs ?   Israel ?  Rothchilds ?  Who are ... THEY.
-cln1whltnc,Video ended where the juice was...
-cln1whltnc,I came from a socialist/communist country I know what kamala is and what she is NOT.....besides her being shady and deceitful....you can smell it through the TV.
-cln1whltnc,Trump will be elected
-cln1whltnc,"Hey, it’s weekend at Biden’s! Can only carry around that corpse for so long."
-cln1whltnc,She’s not even American and sitting there rambling on to make a buck
-cln1whltnc,Mr Peterson  should play dr who.he's perfect
-cln1whltnc,Biden being ousted was definitely not something that he had any input on. He insisted days before the rumors were circulating of his impending removal that he was seeking a second term only to do a complete 180 when the puppet masters behind the scenes coerced him into making the announcement that he would not be seeking re-election.
-cln1whltnc,Dr. Jill Biden 🤦‍♂️please…
-cln1whltnc,"Vacuous Harris and Tampon, the traitor Tim. What a pair to draw to. Only pray the American people don't play that hand."
-cln1whltnc,It's called speed untl the debate  and that night they gave him to much.
-cln1whltnc,Biden is the president of his bathroom.  Kamala is the vice president of Biden's bathroom.  And everything is circling the bowl as we speak.
-cln1whltnc,"Trump will win. 🇺🇸👍🏻🙏💒And Canada will benefit ,democratic woke   Canadians , will see a great change , and it could save their lives , from all these criminals swarming into our 🇨🇦country too, our borders are looser too .  …. We would see much rape and theft and worse via the Harris win , Trump will  win,  and we will see him send many back where they came from by a corrupt government . That gives us 4 years to get our crap together and save what’s left  damaged  
, recovery takes time ."
-cln1whltnc,The Puppet Masters decided to throw the Dynamic Duo under the bus.
-cln1whltnc,"It's astounding how after every fiasco Biden has (theoretically) overseen during the last 3 and a half years that ANYBODY could think to themselves, ""yeah, I need me some more of that) and vote for any democrat, particularly Harris since she's been the klusterfuk-in-chief. The UK have already found to their eternal cost what having a Leftist leader is like. If the US does the same thing it's curtains for the rest of us"
-cln1whltnc,"All of you people who are thinking that either party or candidate is running the show is laughable. Out of all this manufactured crisis comes your saviour, but you know nothing ever changes and the guy theyve made you think is your saviour is not your messiah, he is their mossiach."
-cln1whltnc,"Canadian here with no dog in the US fight other than $ issues around cross border trade. For me, this is an almost single issue election - apropos, Trump is no more a friend to Canada around trade than the Dems. Peterson cozying up to Trump's foot soldiers like this battle axe makes no sense strategically if you agree cross border trade issues are really what Canadians should be thinking about."
-cln1whltnc,"So, for me up here in Canada – I hope that (as they have already been trying to do – non-confidence vote) get Trudeau out of Office.
Please all Americans – Vote Trump in and Popular Vote, Next Vote JFK Jr. The Next Two, Then JD Vance The Two Following That. Please.
Love you all down there - Be cool headed and get out and vote. Because they want confrontation, do not give it to them.
I Love Canada, I Love USA, I Love Mexico, 
HECK – I Love this “Pale Blue Dot” we were graciously given to be alive on, TRUTH comes first."
-cln1whltnc,CABALA Harris is a 3rd grader
-cln1whltnc,"12:20 no worries, we don't either"
-cln1whltnc,"I have been a fan of Jordan’s since his first 12 rules book and followed his seminars, professional, legal and personal challenges and achievements for years. This interview leaves me confused it’s hard to reconcile my view of someone I consider so intelligent, analytical and yet still very compassionate with this interview with Ms Devine where she repeatedly offers up opinions and statements many of which are easily verified based on public data as at best “half truths” where are the challenges the query for the foundations for what she states? If I want editorials I can watch any mainstream media outlet."
-cln1whltnc,Dog and cat is a delicatessen were I come from . Ever been to the United States
-cln1whltnc,"Not illegal migrants, migrants were workers who would migrate back and forth from Mexico to the fields and orchards of the USA during harvest time; today we have what is legally and properly called ""illegal aliens"" rushing in to invade our nation and not to assimilate into the American society."
-cln1whltnc,"Maybe Dr. Peterson is just too scary for democrats or Harris supporters ( or maybe he's just too ""deep"".)  to be guests on his podcasts, but it's starting to look like his presentations comprise a ""stacked deck"".  Which is fine, I guess.  What the heck.  Who said psychologists or their art could or really should be devoted to impartiality or heaven forbid Objectivity?"
-cln1whltnc,"Who is this ghoul you're interviewing? This is all speculation and conspiracy theory. It's obvious from how you engaged with her, there's not much to say other than try to be cordial and let her finish her nonsense."
-cln1whltnc,"So without a president, we ignore Israel? I might be willing to try not having a president for a while..."
-cln1whltnc,Harris has the same master as Biden had.
-cln1whltnc,"How dare you criticize Biden's accomplishments. As he said himself, he defeated Medicare!"
-cln1whltnc,If Harris gets in it could be your last election. Same here in Canada is we can’t get him out.
-cln1whltnc,An exciting story about the swamp.
-cln1whltnc,"For those that don’t know, and couldn’t clearly see, Miranda Devine is an Australian version of Sean Hannity…she was a Sky News Aus editorial mouthpiece and often spewed the same nonsense over here…"
-cln1whltnc,So cabals exist and statements repeated as if they are fact don't make a reason. One guy being conspired against by an entire country. Or one man is a con a fraud. And he's the oldest incombant now who rambles and complains but mostly he lies.
-cln1whltnc,"if you're seeing this comment, it might be a sign to read 'Magnetic Aura' from Talesio ❤️"
-cln1whltnc,it’s funny how those showing unwavering support for Israel actually engage in the worst elements of antisemitism. A cabal? Where did that term come from I wonder🤔The Protocols? Judeo-Bolshevist conspiracy? International Jewry? This is vile.
-cln1whltnc,So she’s not in charge but we blame her? Pick one bc I am confused.
-cln1whltnc,Miranda Devine is a brilliant reporter
-cln1whltnc,Joe is drugged up when the cabal thinks it’s most advantageous to the swamp
-cln1whltnc,What a tease 😆
-cln1whltnc,"The most fascistic action is to replace the President without holding a runoff election among candidates.
Joe's comment about Trump's supporters being 'pieces of garbage' was not merely an insult; it was a tactic aimed at undermining Kamala."
-cln1whltnc,"Her handlers don't care what she does or says because they are convinced they can find enough votes or at least make the numbers add up to make her the winner. She knows she can say anything, and it will all turn out the way they want it to."
-cln1whltnc,"It's amazing that so many American's seem to have forgotten that President Reagan went downhill during the last part of his presidency. Nancy Reagan, his wife, was running the government during that time. Ronald Reagan ended up wit Alzheimer’s disease, but he was protected."
-cln1whltnc,You people need to do some basic fact checking.
-cln1whltnc,"And, still, not a single peep about Trump's 34 convictions."
-cln1whltnc,"Drugs were his only hope
Obviously"
-cln1whltnc,🦝
-cln1whltnc,Now they are pushing a narrative that the conservatives will be violent tonight.
-cln1whltnc,JP and DM lectured us 3 yrs ago about how wrong Trump supporters were about the last election.  Seems JP has become a little more informed on the topic.
-cln1whltnc,"Biden was never cogent. His body doubles spoke clearly, but all blather."
-cln1whltnc,❤❤❤
-cln1whltnc,"Kumalot cannot separate herself from poopy pants,  she's part of his disgusting lawless administration !! She just committed a coup, and stepped in, also technically illegal !!"
-cln1whltnc,JP....did you just use the word WISE in connection with Kamala?  ROFLMAO!!!!
-cln1whltnc,"It would’ve been so easy for the democrats if they had nominated a moderate like Kennedy or Manchin or even Gabbard, but they are not puppets and the cabal needs puppets."
-cln1whltnc,"Feel shame for Kamala.
She's playing whit her inmortal soul."
-cln1whltnc,Kamala=qué mala
-cln1whltnc,Cognitive ability is effected by how much rest the person has stored up for events
-cln1whltnc,"It is very likely that Biden's ""medical emergency"" was a not-so-subtle threat: step aside as candidate, ""or we'll make this very real, very serious and very fatal.""

At that point, he was isolated from the outside world, and his demand was that he continue as ""acting"" President. Because it was an act.  This gives him time for pardons.

He also had the threats against his brother, his son and his wife's bank account.  He could hardly say no.

Same people control Pelosi, and she could go to prison for life for some of the (unsuccessful) plots against President Trump.

And Obama? The people who control Obama have all of his past history - a deeply humiliating history.  More than is commonly known - people who own John Brennan now have what he kept from public view.  

This is one of the most far reaching, egregious, and evil blackmail plots in world history.

If you play footsie with the devil, he'll make you suck his toes."
-cln1whltnc,Obama  and crazy Bernie are in charge
-cln1whltnc,Joe will not forgive or forget his betrayal by Harris.
-cln1whltnc,"Ahh Cmon man! You can’t just put a cliffhanger on “This is a terrible thing to say, but im gonna say it anyways~” and cut the video?! WHAT WERE YOU ABOUT TO SAY J?👀"
-cln1whltnc,Could Biden be faking the cognitive decline in order to avoid responsibility for the corruption within the party.
-cln1whltnc,Barack Hussein and Kamala sold this country out. The final nail in the coffin drops if Trump loses today
-cln1whltnc,Saying she wouldn't do anything different than the last 3 years does not distance her from Joe's disaster.
-cln1whltnc,"Joe wants to be remembered as the only guy that ""took Trump behind the gym"", but he will be remembered as the crook who was never really president, he needed to get fully on board the Kamala train if he wanted any kind of legacy, how long do you think Trump will be in the Whitehouse before he says to a close aide, right get to the bottom of 2020."
-cln1whltnc,R JB cognitive issues covered up or gaslighted?
-cln1whltnc,Fake bullshit
-cln1whltnc,why hasn’t Jill been on the trail with Kam? 🤔
-cln1whltnc,Cabal???? WTF ?!!! STOP THIS BULLSHIT
-cln1whltnc,5:41 what kind of paranoid thing is she insinuating?!
-cln1whltnc,Even Joe with the cognitive deficiencies is smarter then Kamala Harris
-cln1whltnc,"Hunter, Jill, Ashley, Jim and the rest of the motley Biden crew will be penniless in a matter of months if they are truly cut off from the insiders club. You cannot give these people enough money. They are con artists. The con has to always move on to the next con. They have no ability to invest or save money."
-cln1whltnc,"What have the Republics down to fix any of these issues while they haven’t been in power? Have they created any bills that would solve any issues?  The president isn’t sitting in their office writing bills all day, it’s something just about anyone in higher levels of government can do.  So why haven’t we got to read about all the changes that republicans have tried to make only to be shot down? If the losing party isn’t going to do anything when they lost an election why are they still getting paid and having their healthcare paid?"
-cln1whltnc,It's all the ice cream Biden eats. That sugar killed his brain.
-cln1whltnc,"36th, 5 November 2024"
-cln1whltnc,What BS!  Amazing how you can overlook Donald Trump’s sabotage of the bipartisan border bill.
-cln1whltnc,Jordan you are better than this !
-cln1whltnc,"I truly hate to indulge in what could be seen as a conspiracy theory, but scheduling the debate so late in the day, and many indications that Biden was not ""juiced"" since his pupils weren't dilated as they were during the state of the union and the ""Dark Brandon"" speech, leads me to believe this was a coup. They made sure he flopped at just the right moment."
-cln1whltnc,"and thank you Jordan, your comment at 11:00 is spot on"
-cln1whltnc,What a scary world we live in.
-cln1whltnc,This platform is part of “the media”.
-cln1whltnc,"I am not pro Biden/harris but these blanket statements about economy problem, inflation, etc…guys…the US economy is doing fine; up and downs are NORMAL! Covid hit every country and inflation was not an isolated event in the US alone. These people on podcasts need to show me the stats, show me the proof. Also, get an economist to explain to the American people that tariffs will not solve all their issues. Also, on another note, remember that making products in the US will increase prices and dig into the citizens pockets…GET AN ECONOMIST on the show please"
-cln1whltnc,"Blackmail-, promised $$$$$ and a pardon for his pride and joy HB"
-cln1whltnc,Good job Joe...
-cln1whltnc,This video starts with some claims that aren’t backup with any data.  How can anyone estimate the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border and what have the republicans done to solve whatever issue is being dramatized for this video?  No one needs to make something that bad look worst if it’s actually as bad as they are making it out to be.  How many illegals have been sent back during the last four years? It’s a lot more than I thought it would be based on so many people calling our southern border “open”.
-cln1whltnc,I think they were giving Biden drugs.
-cln1whltnc,"I believe Joe stepped down because of his passionate desire to see if the Democrats could beat Trump again.  It has to get old hearing Trump not conceded his loss, so as a strategic move, he got out of the race. He did make a speech about it, but i guess you may not believe him. Now, if you are speculating, he was coerced, and he might have been, but that's what all of this video is about....speculation"
-cln1whltnc,What is the reason why people hate each other?
-cln1whltnc,This is lack of accountability and exposure will yield a higher level of incompetence very soon. As Kim stated many will be very afraid because exposure will have its accountability.
-cln1whltnc,Go back to the Russia
-cln1whltnc,Vice president Kamala Haris needs to distancing themselves from the President? So who the fuck is running the Country other than Barack Obama.
-cln1whltnc,Obama mad he won’t get his 4th term
-cln1whltnc,It's  too late! She can't distance herself.
-cln1whltnc,"“The only lives that truly matter are those who respect the lives of others” 
- God said that, I’m only repeating it"
-cln1whltnc,"Trump is friendly with dictators and Musk is as well. After tslking to Xo, Trump talked to Musk about shutting down Starlink over Taiwan as a favour to Xi. Very helpful for China to invade.

Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un etc know Trump is a useful idiot, easily corrupted and can be taken advantage of by stroking his ego with flattery.

For example...
Why was the son of Constantine Nikolayev hired as a campaign manager for Trump?  That is the same Constantine Nikolayev that shares 88% ownership of American Ethane with two other Russian nationals, Mikael Yuriev and Andrei Kunetbaev. All three are in the inner circle of Putin.

American Ethane was a large donor to speaker Mike Johnson who, when it became public, gave the money back. This was proven by testimony of the convicted Russian spy Maria Butina. She tried to be influential with the Republicans via the NRA.

Incidentally, Trump was promoting American Ethane when he went on a trip to China. Also, a Russian billionaire was a large donor to the Donald Trump app Truth Social.

Meanwhile, it is interesting that the father of very pro Russia and Trump propagandist Tucker Carlson, has a corrupt seeming background. Dick Carlson runs the policy think tank and lobby group called Policy Impact. They have received a lot of money to promote the Hungarian government for Viktor Orban. The same president that is always trying pro Russian propaganda and influence.

All the recent events with Tenet Media, with ex RT correspondent Lauren Chen as the co manager are another example of typically pro Trump activities by Russia.
So it seems that Russian orchestrated propaganda has been said for a look time now, by Lauren Chen (Russian Millenial), Dave Rubin (Rouble Report), Tim Pool (Tim Stool), Benny Johnson, Lauren Southern etc. Now Candace Owens is added to the list and is under investigation.

Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, admitted on Russian TV that this has all been happening, and laughing with happiness at their successful work to corrupt USA public opinion."
-cln1whltnc,"This corruption is worldwide, it's horrible, how does such a thing nest in without conspiring. We are played on  high level. Useful idiots standing in line. Hope trump wins but look out. Not there yet. for a cat in a pinch is unpredictable"
-cln1whltnc,"Kamala has been quite successful in distancing Joe from her campaign but hasn't done a lot policy-wise and that doesn't make any sense, at least to me. We just have a new face to the old policies."
-cln1whltnc,Why do people need to say no?
-cln1whltnc,Thanks Jordan!
-cln1whltnc,Trump looks different in that blue suit 😂
-cln1whltnc,"she's compliant in all of Biden's failures, I hope the people prevail today"
-cln1whltnc,I thought all these things were a test from God. How dare you politiciZe that!?
-cln1whltnc,This is why the west has fallen. All that abortion = sacrifice for satan
-cln1whltnc,I want to see jordan peterson interview the rizzler

qCbfTN-caFI,"""What would your deal with russian/Ukraine look like?""
""Bidens the worst president in history and she's even worse"" 😂"
qCbfTN-caFI,Lex has become a monster of a podcaster.  good job👌
qCbfTN-caFI,About Ukraine. There is no great culture. There is no culture at all. Read about Bandera
qCbfTN-caFI,"lots of pointless ad-hominem attacks as expected (and outright lies about current inflation and economy), but tbh, as someone who was extremely opposed to trump in general, i gotta say he sounds surprisingly coherent in this. prior to this i only saw the debate where he lost miserably IMO. but i was also not well-informed, as i'm from germany and don't have to personally vote anyway. but his opinion and statements on climate change and working together with EU/NATO worry me greatly still. would have loved discussions on those more controversial topics. also in terms of global conflicts, he doesn't really articulate _any_ solution space, as if it was some business secret. i think it will turn out to be a load of BS and he won't be able to turn the tides in the current tendency towards more conflicts or even WW3 in the worst case.

i also understand that it's just not the style of lex fridman to push back in interviews, but trump abused that fact deliberately here to litter the interview with misinformation. (""country is going down (factually incorrect), they are doing a terrible job (blanket statement)"", etc.)"
qCbfTN-caFI,"You're doing a GREAT job, not a shitty job!
Yes, keep working on your speaking skills, but the impostor syndrome is flat wrong about you!"
qCbfTN-caFI,"Did anyone hear the secret message at the end. When trump was asked about death. He inserted the words "" tic toc "" , thats clearly very deliberate.  I seen him in another video,  after the results came in , and he was chatting to someone , holding a "" tic toc "" box of mints. All very sutle, looks like he's sending a hidden message to someone. I'd be afraid if that's the case , politics is a tough business."
qCbfTN-caFI,Who’s here after Trump won again
qCbfTN-caFI,Lex are you a Harris voter
qCbfTN-caFI,I am subscribing because you had my favorite president on.
qCbfTN-caFI,Trump won due to these interviews.
qCbfTN-caFI,"Lex you are a true gem, I respect you so much. Keep doing what you do."
qCbfTN-caFI,"I love how Lex seems to have this swagger/gravitas that even Trump accepts. He just leans back and asks whatever questions he wants (with a sort of smirk on his face), and Trump gladly answers."
qCbfTN-caFI,"Tolerated watching few mins of this mans talking right after listening to intelligent conversation with Bernie and man what a difference in substances of conversations.  One person has grounded thoughts and other mostly feeds off of lying,  fear mongering and blame gaming when he has initiated several of those himself such as afghan deal or pulling out of border deal,  etc......."
qCbfTN-caFI,"Самый сильный человек современности, мы будем еще долго его вспоминать на ровне с Черчелем, Македонским, Наполеоном и остальными величайшими личностями."
qCbfTN-caFI,"Lex, I thank you for the light you shine and the normality you try to foster in all. And at this moment I thank you for the words of Kipling that you have so eloquently presented. Thank you!"
qCbfTN-caFI,"Any retrospective comments? Basically Trump has been transparent on all his moves for a better America. 
Everyone knows his vision and what steps are needed for a better America. 

He won elect/pop/senate/ & if not house by now…"
qCbfTN-caFI,the best podcast I've ever seen. It changed my whole perspective on life !!!
qCbfTN-caFI,How did I miss this interview I have been on everything Trump Since before the 2024 election and Lex Fridman is one of my favorite channels I completely missed this one 😂😂
qCbfTN-caFI,God Bless President Trump !
qCbfTN-caFI,you are going a great job with your interviews!
qCbfTN-caFI,sem ser dublado e foda
qCbfTN-caFI,Сегодня мне не очень нравится Фридман.
qCbfTN-caFI,Who's watching this after the election?
qCbfTN-caFI,He's trying to say he's points multiple times through the art of inception but he's only gaining mass boredom lol its ok he's at least trying to be upfront its gotta be challenging especially with loads of classified info and lex in mental pursuit of the dig for gold 😂
qCbfTN-caFI,Fuck yess this needed to happen 😂
qCbfTN-caFI,"He had some nice assets that he threw around. Like ""islands"" sure buddy we know what you meant...."
qCbfTN-caFI,TRUMP the BEST https://youtube.com/shorts/ASBQDIS2sfY?si=2475MGXCuPZLrTmw
qCbfTN-caFI,Канабис равно язва желудка ! Не стоит этого делать !
qCbfTN-caFI,Congratulations to Trumps win
qCbfTN-caFI,"Congratulations on being so helpful in promoting him, you and Elon will profit mightily no doubt.  Yeah right he’ll publish Epstein (bff) docs.  So sweet how religious he is"
qCbfTN-caFI,"I like your style, calm and deep questions…thank you, Lex!"
qCbfTN-caFI,"Trump flopping like a fish to duck election fraud conspiracy theories at 19:29.
This is what is scary about the guy. He knowingly lied about losing an election and now all of his cultists will believe a lie the rest of their lives.
And Kamala is the one who can't answer a direct question? It's gonna be a dangerous road from here that's for sure..."
qCbfTN-caFI,Трамп ти дуже сильний)))!😊
qCbfTN-caFI,❤
qCbfTN-caFI,Трамп рубай  вірю в тебе
qCbfTN-caFI,Bro ppl in this thread are raging hard about trump winning.  You can tell who are the hate-mongers while Lex’s fanbase and newcomers are saying this was a great interview 😂 being salty after the civil war is the exact reason dems lost 😂 dems have been really upset after losing slaves 😂
qCbfTN-caFI,"Wow. What a meandering old windbag. He can't maintain a coherent idea for more than a few seconds. Lex is continually trying to get him to focus on the question he was just asked. But, it's impossible. He just talks in circles and keeps repeating himself. Full ADHD on display. Hilarious.😂"
qCbfTN-caFI,"What an absolute joke of an interview. I could dig out my grandmother who has been dead for 10 years, and she would give better answers than this babbling figure. If Kamala Harris would be sitting there, giving those “answers”, she would’ve been ripped to pieces, and rightly so. Lex, congratulations on not laughing out loud the whole time. Jesus…"
qCbfTN-caFI,10:00
qCbfTN-caFI,"How much more of a pathetic pos do you have to be, like this criminal who has committed how insane crimes???"
qCbfTN-caFI,❤❤❤❤
qCbfTN-caFI,"You are all crazy. This nut will NEVER make a peace dem which is fair and square FOR the Ukrainian People. It's gonna be a disaster of a Deal, like all the Business he has run down"
qCbfTN-caFI,Not even CLOSE....DJ Trump Triumph HUGE❤
qCbfTN-caFI,"Unfortunately, as a woman, bringing Trump onto your show is a dealbreaker for me, so I’ll be unsubscribing. I’ll miss following along—it’s been a great experience. 🌈

Ladies, it’s time we stand up for ourselves. When platforms amplify voices that disregard our rights, it’s on us to take action. Unsubscribe, because views and likes translate to money, and money means power. Time to abort. (Pun intended)."
qCbfTN-caFI,"Trump with Lex, Schulz, and Rogan are all the same Trump but he does know his audience, he panders alot less here with Lex, thats probably because the questions are a lot more sophisticated. Lex as a podcaster is so crucial. I am tryna to see Trump on Hot ones tho..."
qCbfTN-caFI,Man Trump must be afraid to one day need a mental institution for himself xD
qCbfTN-caFI,This whole interview is made for people between age 20-30. Stupid questions and talk..
qCbfTN-caFI,"❤
This   conversation   is  unique  ,  Thank  you ,  gentlemen"
qCbfTN-caFI,It’s crazy almost half of the world didn’t vote for Trump when he’s the only one telling the truth about things. Kamala’s whole campaign was based off of lies
qCbfTN-caFI,"In Springfield. They are eating the dogs, they are eating the cats. This is the man who is in control of America. Lex why did you not get Kamala on your show?"
qCbfTN-caFI,"“Providing Unlicensed cryptology services” is the most terrifying sentence i heard in my life. The fact that the likes of apple and facebook claim to offer end to end encryption, yet are not being arrested in france is even more scary. And this i think in the context of the last elections both sides of the spectrum agree that atleast one of the sides are evil, conspiring and willing to do anything for power. They just dissagree about who. So clearly the victims of theese breaches of privacy is not only terrorists"
qCbfTN-caFI,The guy cant hold a coherant though and refuses to answer a single question. Cant belive that people supports this giant douche
qCbfTN-caFI,Horrible human being
qCbfTN-caFI,I wonder if Trump thinks there were wide spread voter fraud now that he won.
qCbfTN-caFI,"Trump is lying out his ass about Epstein, looks like he wanted to wink at the camera when he said he's never been there lmao"
qCbfTN-caFI,"I remember the moment I realized I was a conservative. I had just climbed out a window to hang siding on a million dollar home the weather was perfect Dino Rosie was days away from having his first election stolen after a month of recounts. Not long after that, I reluctantly voted for Obama’s first term. 8 years later I enthusiastically voted for Trump (who is more progressive than Obama by 2008 standards) another 8 years have passed and I reluctantly voted for Trump. So I’ll admit that all his responses sounded like a politician ducking and dodging, he’s definitely not as sharp as he was leading up to and during his first term, all his picks are “former” democrats and leftist loons, and I have no hope that he’s going to make the decisions that need to be made to secure the future of valid elections, western civilization is the manifestation of whites looking out for their best interest altruistically uplifting other countries and creating mutual gains, but without borders a democracy will just become mob rule where the invader and parasites bite the hand that feeds them out of jealousy and, spite, being manipulated by and exploited for the gain of a tribe that wants to rule over the them from within their ethnostate to fulfill an evangelical prophecy. They should have never expanded voting rights beyond the local level. If people had a representative to vote for them they would take retribution on the person who they selected at a local level if they backstabbed the people."
qCbfTN-caFI,THE PAPI TRUMP EFFECT!! #PAPITRUMP2024 AND BEYOND!! 🫡🔥🤘🏻💯
qCbfTN-caFI,I cannot believe this was done 2 months ago and I missed it
qCbfTN-caFI,"Trump loves dictators, and is a wannabe, soon to be dictator, of course he would pretend Kamala is the equivalent.  STFU muppet comrade Fridman."
qCbfTN-caFI,Hillary should be in jail
qCbfTN-caFI,The disappointment on Lex's face is so visible when Trump avoids the answer to the division question.... i feel for you Lex
qCbfTN-caFI,Amazing AMA Lex👊
qCbfTN-caFI,Lex you did an outstanding job!
qCbfTN-caFI,Listen to all these losers commenting. Be grateful that this administration will make your lives better.
qCbfTN-caFI,Thank you Lex for your job.
qCbfTN-caFI,
qCbfTN-caFI,Come on @Lex Fridman just admit this man is an imbecile
qCbfTN-caFI,6 millones
qCbfTN-caFI,Congratulations America—you’ve elected a convicted felon. Someone needs to turn up the pressure on his spray on tan 😹
qCbfTN-caFI,It wasn’t a close one 22:44
qCbfTN-caFI,You're now responsible for installing fascism in this country.
qCbfTN-caFI,👍🏻
qCbfTN-caFI,Congratulations president Trump
qCbfTN-caFI,38:00 trump always with the bold statments
qCbfTN-caFI,"You do not negotiate with Pootin, he is terrorist, KGB mentality. You show weakness, he goes further."
qCbfTN-caFI,seems like he didnt like to talk about the list
qCbfTN-caFI,26:18 we probably would have a better world - Bravo Lex. Thank you for saying this!!
qCbfTN-caFI,"Nov 6
Just checking out number of views: 6.2 M
Amazing!"
qCbfTN-caFI,Hate YT algorithm!! I subscribed and selected Lex’s posts but I never got a notification of any of his posts!! 😡 only saw this interview now
qCbfTN-caFI,Красавчик Лекс 🤝
qCbfTN-caFI,"Notice how different this interview is from the Bernie Sanders interview. Bernie answers the questions he is asked. He is not shamelessly badmouthing others. He is articulate. Such an incredible contrast! On this Election Day it is mind blowing how many Americans are following Trump blindly despite his name calling, incoherence, crudeness and utter lack of facts."
qCbfTN-caFI,Just the same talking points repeated ad nauseum. I have TDS because HE is tedious.
qCbfTN-caFI,😂
qCbfTN-caFI,"Elon, Joe, (your friends) endorse DT a convicted felon, twice impeached president, who tried to overthrow the government-  denounced by key Republicans who worked with him. What is your opinion about the character of DT?"
qCbfTN-caFI,Totally batshit
qCbfTN-caFI,Lex you have interviewed some of the smartest people on the planet. Ask some penetrating questions. DT  is pathological liar and a moron.
qCbfTN-caFI,When does Kamala go on? .... OK I can't stop laughing
qCbfTN-caFI,Trump is sad
qCbfTN-caFI,"❤
Noiceless   Steps   of   Justice   ??"
qCbfTN-caFI,The difference between this and the Bernie Sanders interviews is staggering. Trump can barely put a sentence together properly while Sanders has trouble not sounding relatable and down-to-earth on every occasion. Incredible contrast. To think that people would vote for Trump over any other candidate just shows how catastrophically education has failed in America. Truly a shame.
qCbfTN-caFI,"Anecdotal UFO reports? Lex, are you serious?"
qCbfTN-caFI,You cannot force anyone into respect.
qCbfTN-caFI,There is no good on any of the two sides.
qCbfTN-caFI,"Tariffs have always caused lots of damage, as well."
qCbfTN-caFI,I'm from Europe and I don't believe that anyone as intellectually poor as this man could be ever elected to lead the gov't in any European country
qCbfTN-caFI,"It would make a politician unique if that person just answers the questions of interviewers instead of  jumping around, but they never do it, biden or trump both never gave an honest transparent answer to their interviewers, stereotype  of politicians, that is reasonable thogh because this way makes them secure and free of any pressure or accusation in the future, but on the other hand they could lose the trust of people. Trump seems to be kind of person who doesn't like to wrap his point in considerate slimy words versus his competers but even he is quite terrible in answering the question, soo frustrating politicians are, they almost almost equally terrible! I agree with the line of tom shelby in peaky blinders about left and right."
qCbfTN-caFI,"Спасибо за перевод на русский! Хоть и знаю английский, но приятно когда два языка"
qCbfTN-caFI,23:59 I am not sure you should show a source that is provided by a party which obviously is biased
qCbfTN-caFI,Trump 2024 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
qCbfTN-caFI,"Lex, I see no reason for you to feel you are doing a shitty job. On the other hand, I totally understand what you mean. Because of thati just want to say I love your interviews and the way you discuss topics with people on the pod. Thank you for that and keep on trying to always improve! ❤"
qCbfTN-caFI,Лекс! Братишка! Спасибо тебе большое за то что ты делаешь! Жаль только недавно русский добавил! Продолжай пожалуйста ты классный! Люблю тебя искренни!
qCbfTN-caFI,"Funny coincidence as the Trump podcast falls under 442, the Japanese American battalion who saved us in World War 2."
qCbfTN-caFI,11:09  THATS CRAZYYYY 😮
qCbfTN-caFI,10:55
qCbfTN-caFI,"Thank you, Lex. Listening after an episode with B. Sanders. What a stark difference. One is the politician with the heart, coherent principles, beliefs and life long work to back those beliefs. Another - loose cannon  (for the rich)."
qCbfTN-caFI,💩💩💩💩🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
qCbfTN-caFI,Ironic that this was one of Lex’s least interesting interview. Trump just not a very insightful or interesting person
qCbfTN-caFI,Ugh… word salad on war…
qCbfTN-caFI,"Only Trump would describe getting shot as ""not a pleasant experience"" lmao"
qCbfTN-caFI,I think trump has been putting his hand in the magic brownies jar. Might explain some of his cognitive difficulties at time’s.
qCbfTN-caFI,Lex is awesome
qCbfTN-caFI,Ah man enjoyable but soft ...
qCbfTN-caFI,"Trump's intellectual age seems to be around what five year old has. I wasn't sure if this is AI generated. I still isn't. Seriously? This is a joke, right?"
qCbfTN-caFI,"Great interview. President Trump is amazing. I like the way he does not suffer fools and says so. His 4 years in office were the best. What a disaster the last 4 years with Biden and Harris have been!!! It is incredible how many people were duped when they voted for them, but there was so much election interference ie media supressing the Hunter Biden laptop scandal just before the election. Shame on them."
qCbfTN-caFI,"The staff at Arlington (not the family) told Trump's crew to put their cameras away and they abused them and told them to go F-off. 100% he went there for the publicity, he has zero care for the family."
qCbfTN-caFI,"Trump is not the best at answering questions. The interviewer will ask a question, and he doesn't necessarily answer it. Im sure Lex knows, but there's no point in trying to steer Trump in the right direction."
qCbfTN-caFI,Thanks animeflv for this
qCbfTN-caFI,Matrix is promoting this shit!
qCbfTN-caFI,La recun porque chuxa me manda a este video de mrd
qCbfTN-caFI,Que mrd
qCbfTN-caFI,Why the hell I am coming to here if I go to watch anime in hianime 😡
qCbfTN-caFI,Ni vrg
qCbfTN-caFI,Hp anuncio de mierda
qCbfTN-caFI,ko tolllllllllllll
qCbfTN-caFI,Vengo de futbol libre
qCbfTN-caFI,religion can be good and it can be dangerous. A relationship with Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven.
qCbfTN-caFI,Уже зашел на госуслуги и проголосовал за Трампа! В этот раз тоже все Россией вам Трампа выберем!
qCbfTN-caFI,"Kamala is a Socialist, period."
qCbfTN-caFI,"End prohibition, period. We do not want to give big pharma companies more power by making it prescription-only."
qCbfTN-caFI,End welfare and freeloaders will stop coming.
qCbfTN-caFI,"Business is clean, politics is dirty."
qCbfTN-caFI,He is buying views
qCbfTN-caFI,Trump for president he will make the country good again democratic party destroyed this country
qCbfTN-caFI,How many times can he say in 2 minutes that it takes a lot of courage to run for president? I counted 7 times
qCbfTN-caFI,Hahahaha do you guys actually hear this idiot?😂 otherwise loving the vids lex
qCbfTN-caFI,"Seeing Trump discuss UFOs with Lex Fridman is next-level! Lex has such a unique way of digging into these topics, and I can’t help but wonder what’s still hidden from the public. I’m constantly exploring stories and sightings like these on my own channel—anyone else feel like these conversations are only scratching the surface of what’s out there?"
qCbfTN-caFI,"so in this podcast trump claims to know very little about rogan, calling him ""a liberal guy"", but then in the Rogan podcast he says hes a ""student"" of Rogan and that he knows he's ""not a Kamala guy"". How can anybody actually listen to him"
qCbfTN-caFI,"He is an aspiring DICTATOR! Aka Hitler 
The guy who wrote his book said he was impossible to work with"
qCbfTN-caFI,"What's wrong with communism? I understand that as a businessman, communism hurts him. But communism is about real equality. What chance does a poor person have to win a lawsuit against a corporation? The USSR is not the best option, but not the worst either. My parents say that under the Soviet regime they felt free and important. When capitalism came to Russia, ordinary people became cogs in a soulless mechanism and stopped being free. During the Soviet period, any citizen could afford a good vacation, a free sanatorium, their children went to children's camps for free. The streets were safe and there was confidence in the future. Yes, there were no various sweets, but there were healthy products in abundance and everyone could eat them. The horror stories of the Americans about the terrible Soviet regime and five KGB agents assigned to each person sound simply ridiculous. The USSR was a wonderful country and those who lived in it sincerely grieve that it is no more.  And only those who did not live in the USSR, bandits and businessmen, talk about how terrible it was, because they could not afford yachts with golden railings."
qCbfTN-caFI,Sigh... I'm so happy I'm not American and have to choose upcoming election between those 2 (only 2!!) candidates....
qCbfTN-caFI,ГОООЛЛЛЛ НАШ СЛОНЯРА!!!!!!!
qCbfTN-caFI,This is both very funny and terrifying 😂😮
qCbfTN-caFI,"Lex is a left wing, communist, pro Ukrainian Neo Nazi stooge. The way he simps over Marxist economists is sickening."
qCbfTN-caFI,Wish there were more hard questions to do with Trumps presidency.
qCbfTN-caFI,So you sre not responsable?
qCbfTN-caFI,"When our choices were Hillery and Trump, despite not liking him I still thought he was the better of two evils.  I now know the guy is a pretty sensible and smart man.  When I was less exposed to those in the big cities. Later in life I met a number of New Yorkers and learned that most of them were like Trump.  I don't mean that in a insulting way, I just recognize they are living in a much faster lane than we in the mid-west.  I've now listened to him on your podcast,  Dr. Phil, Joe Rogan, and a host of other folks.  The guy is smart, savvy, knows how to communicate and well connected with all kinds of folks, he's overall a well rounded man.  Sometimes I can't believe what he said, but damn it,  now he is the man for the job."
qCbfTN-caFI,"You are doing a great job Lex! Keep at it man! Stay fearless, loving, spontaneous and creative!"
qCbfTN-caFI,"So glad I found you in the early morning hours due to my relentless need to understand this complex time regarding the political arena ,first podcast was with Bernie ❤then Mark Cuban ❤, after watching Richard Wolf very interesting man . then Donald Trump who you handled I guess to the best of your ability beings he’s super sensitive nothing new there , I’d love for Kamala or Walz to show up that may be of great value right now .❤️you too"
qCbfTN-caFI,"Kamala Harris was a coward to appear on this program or on Rogan. In every interview she appears she shows how much of an insincere fool she is and her campaign manager knows it. Ultimately, it shows how uninvested on the American people Kamala and her people actually are they want to win an election by hiding."
qCbfTN-caFI,"Трамп имеет военное и экономическое образование.
И поэтому я его люблю.
Если кто и имеет быть президентом, то только Трамп, он образован.
Его образование-специальное, для того, чтобы быть хорошим президент, он патриот своей страны."
qCbfTN-caFI,Why's this so edited?
qCbfTN-caFI,"Lex is a great interviewer, he asked a lot of questions that no one else would"
qCbfTN-caFI,"It’s really unfortunate that there was very little explanation of policy. Trump consistently gives answers that are just goals without any explanation of how he would accomplish those goals. It is the duty of interviewers to be neutral and dig for answers. It should not be sufficient to just say, “I will talk to Putin”, “I will cut a deal”, “I will deport X number of illegal immigrants”, “I will drop oil to $1.90”, “I will replace federal income tax with tariffs”. Without any elaboration these statements mean absolutely nothing."
qCbfTN-caFI,A total waste of time.
qCbfTN-caFI,"I would NEVER interview this corrupt man. EVER.  This is tantamount to interviewing Adolph Hitler in 1931.  Obscene to let this convict have free air time.  As a 5th generation veteran, I find him absolutely DISGUSTING.  His own Vice President, 1/2 of his Cabinet, his own Joint Chiefs of Staff (all of them) state how UNFIT and UNSTABLE this man is.   What good can possibly come from this man???   His fascination, alone, with Nazi history, stating ""Hitler did some good things,"" saying ""he wish he had generals like Hitler's,"" et al, should disqualify this pathetic man from ANY office!!!  Period.  He is a straight up wanna-be Dictator and Neo-Fascists who was, literally, CREATED by Hollywood to be some magical smart business man.  He is a con man. A phony.  I like Lex and his show, but putting Trump on REALLY pisses me off given what a grifting SOB and serial liar he is, not to mention a convicted rapist and decades a predator of women. Obscene and immoral."
qCbfTN-caFI,Serious question does Trump have ADHD?
qCbfTN-caFI,Not exactly Joe Rogan views. Oops
qCbfTN-caFI,"His face paint is very noticeable, I wish he wouldn't paint himself orange. It's very distracting."
qCbfTN-caFI,Its like he purposefully avoids saying anything of substance
qCbfTN-caFI,"Are we all watching the same video? I genuinely dont understand how trump can recycle the same stupid, fear mongering, cookie cutter arguments, no matter what question lex poses, and people still find it charming apparently"
qCbfTN-caFI,"the presidency is another soon-to-be-failed business anyway.
Time to study 😊"
qCbfTN-caFI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uztIUUh5-WE Kamala's Regime Motto  ....she'll never be enough or HAVE enough......and use anyone to get her way. Maybe she should grow a mustache.
qCbfTN-caFI,I fucking love you Lex. The out-of-pocket psychedelics question was gold.
qCbfTN-caFI,All of these podcasts Trump have done are not calling him out or fact checking….
qCbfTN-caFI,"Dont mind me, im just feeling all types of emotional listening to Lex talk to me about anxiety and university. 🥹❤ all while im studying for my differential equation exam."
qCbfTN-caFI,There was so much fluff that was not inspected! Come on
qCbfTN-caFI,"Kamala is socialist.  Remember, communism starts with socialism."
qCbfTN-caFI,👍 Imagine Kamala sitting here? That would mean an hour long of Kamala’s giggles and laughs🤣🤣🤣 and her famous intro “I grew up in the middle class…”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
qCbfTN-caFI,USA is a shithole. You don’t even have healthcare insurance 😂😂😂😂😂
qCbfTN-caFI,After listening to this podcast. Can anyone with a semblance of understanding vote for trump? He is like a school boy trying to sound like he knows what’s going on by lying continuously. Making up and improvising at every turn. No rudder no keel
qCbfTN-caFI,Trump is and always will be a nut job. Talks about all and everything except the answer to the question. Rambling and rambling on about how bad things are and will be if he does not get his job back. Fail!
qCbfTN-caFI,The Epstein list is available now and Trumps name is all over it. 
qCbfTN-caFI,"2x the content of the jre ep in 1/3 the time, good job lex!"
qCbfTN-caFI,Go Trump ❤
qCbfTN-caFI,"6 min in... this guy's is hard to understand on 2x spred, because he speaks so sloooow"
qCbfTN-caFI,VOTE FOR THE GREEN PARTY EVERYONE 💚🇺🇸 JILL STEIN STANDS AGAINST THE GENOCIDE!!!!!DO THE LEAST YOU CAN FOR GAZA!!!!!!VOTE!!!!!VOLUNTEER!!!!!!!!SPREAD THE MESSAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA!!!!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
qCbfTN-caFI,"God, trump cant be anything..but being himself!"
qCbfTN-caFI,I didn’t even know this existed I cannot wait to let this invade my mind
qCbfTN-caFI,"Second Amendment to the United States Constitution - ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Fundamentally what created our country was our ability as a people to rise against the government as they become tyrannical in nature.

The Second Amendment IS the voice of the people, with no Second Amendment there is no First. Without even considering the empirical data, and self defense arguments which have merit of their own, it allows the people the option of non-compliance to Government which without, is forfeit. I'm going to take a shot in the dark and imagine that Hong Kong's protests don't favor the protestors having to fight back against THEIR tyrannical government with archery equipment. If you disagree with Government or Politics, the 2nd Amendment is the right of the PEOPLE. I may have been born in Korea, but I was raised American, Protect the FREE PEOPLE"
qCbfTN-caFI,"Yeah, well you're not a historian.  And William Shirer (The avowed Communist) has distorted WW2 history more than anyone I can think of.    For example, he is the reason people call National SOCIALSTS ""Right Wing.""  There are few ""historians"" worse than Shirer.  He's the guy only dilettante students of history site. And any credible historian knows this.   ...But anyway, you actually did a great job interviewing Trump.  Well done."
qCbfTN-caFI,Not wasting my time on this tool. Bye
qCbfTN-caFI,"Can someone please inform him.
That the golf course he built in the wildlife sanctuary in Scotland.
Has officially lost the sanctuary designation.
Due the loss of the actual unique habitat, and wildlife.
So he doesn't have to worry about that anymore."
qCbfTN-caFI,46 minutes only? Lex buddy your long form interview are always 2 - 4 hours. 46 minutes is not by any stretch of the imagination long form. Why did you cut him a break?
qCbfTN-caFI,How is it I’m just now discovering Lex Fridman? New sub.
qCbfTN-caFI,"if you compare likes/coments /views, with other lex videos, its so obvious this one has been eaither shadowbanned or the total views been modified. shame on youtube.
Even the pinned comment have more likes. Lul"
qCbfTN-caFI,I'm glad you had Trump on but I can't say I enjoyed it. Was the episode heavily edited? It kind of seemed like it. The conversation didn't flow nearly as well as his episode with Theo Von.
qCbfTN-caFI,"I think interviews are good.

 Providing the candidates are fact checked. Real time, on the ticker tape running across the bottom of the screen."
qCbfTN-caFI,Holy hell trump doesn’t know how to answer a question.
qCbfTN-caFI,"The phrase ""Life is what you do while you're waiting to die"" is often attributed to British author and poet Charles Bukowski, who explored themes of life's struggles, routine, and existentialism in his works. However, variations of this sentiment have appeared in literature and pop culture, capturing a sometimes bleak perspective on life’s purpose and the inevitability of mortality."
qCbfTN-caFI,Trump!
qCbfTN-caFI,35:00  destiny interview has more views.
qCbfTN-caFI,😮😮😮😅😅😂🤣🤣🤣
qCbfTN-caFI,I enjoy your thoughtful style of interviewing.  Your voice is soothing.  You gently guide your guest back on point.   Don't let the critics change you.
qCbfTN-caFI,"Lex I want to tell you something, don't listen to the haters, you may have suffer from impostor syndrome but you shouldn't,  your podcasts are amazing, we are lucky to be able to listen in on these conversations, you are amazing, I mean this as a huge compliment: your podcasts are on the same level as the Joe Rogan Experience, I really hope that Kamala has the integrity and courage to come on your podcast, it'd be a huge loss for her not to do it."
qCbfTN-caFI,"I am so glad Im not american 😅 I would loose sleep on deciding who to vote for. I don’t like any candidate. If you are American, tell me; Who do you prefer? and is one of the candidates your dream president? or are you choosing the lesser evil?"
qCbfTN-caFI,Lamest interview ever 😂
qCbfTN-caFI,"UFO topic:   The orbs of light is from dynamic Casimir effect, the intermittent radio waves is that light redshifted from time dilation, and the reason why they travel faster than sound without a sonic boom is because the object is temporarily intangible while being quantum matter, and those quantum physics take over when the object is isolated from local physics probably through exceeding a minimum local clock tick rate most likely through electrostatic time dilation of standing waves.  

These UAP show up before bad events such as volcano eruptions, and I want to stress that quantum mechanics physics allows the future to affect the present, and we measure such quantum effects in particle experiments such as in measurable quantum time reversal, but aliens do that with whole spacecrafts that they can walk into and see time in the eyes of the particle, so they actually see the quantum superposition of future causes, and they choose the present, which means they manipulate quantum probability meaning they choose our future in the ways that we externally can't from our local perspective until we replace the particle with an actual intelligent reaction device or person.  I also want to mention that aliens clearly didn't disclose themselves, and with their technology that uses quantum mechanics it would be easy to manipulate quantum probability choosing our future to delay disclosures, and they had been delayed for many years now, with ""coincidences"" piling up extraterrestrial being replaced by non-human intelligence, UFO by UAP, classification of videos, not listening to close encounter reports, seek to remove funding to find hidden programs, and garbage unclassified video being presented, what I see is an anti-disclosure hidden by ""coincidences"" too frequent, and venting the frustration by claiming it's a disclosure in progress, but it seems to be the opposite.  Governments should be shooting at these objects because the extraterrestrials who travel to Earth are those who enjoy observing human suffering, and struggles, and what type of creature that craves that doesn't cause it also, a strong deterrent is needed, they clearly have technology to become intangible space rocks don't harm them, and no sonic booms, so that show of hate is effective, and its only reasonable to defend people from these creatures so that extra-terrestrials don't cause chaos carelessly because countless people who had close encounters had their lives ruined and it was caused by those hostile extra-terrestrials."
qCbfTN-caFI,"He actually admitted that he lost in 2020 ""by a whisker"" 11'07"""
qCbfTN-caFI,"9:43 you're talking more vicariously and sideways out of your mental dementia 
And raging secrets"

EJ5tbKQeBKE,"This is a BS discussion.  Letting Cenk run his mouth, essentially attacking the Dems from the Left and giving MAGA faux outrage points for their bad faith argument.  Being on the Right of Harris and harvesting Left of Harris criticism is the height of hypocrisy.  The fact is, Harris resonated with a lot voters and is enjoying success."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"This is coming from a dude who “ran as president” but knew he was never eligible, aka took advantage of his fanbase."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Sneaky ass democrats
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"lol the level of logical leaps this douchebag attempts to justify Kamala Harris being forced on the American people as a Candidate is astounding, I dont think even he believes the bullshit coming out of his own mouth"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Why would I vote for a party that doesn’t trust the people to put a candidate forward? It was not morally right not to have a new primary.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Him jokingly saying shut up shut up is pretty ironic. 

The dude freaks out if you don't agree with him 100% and will literally tell you to shut up lol. 😮‍💨"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk would get destroyed in any physical altercation
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"In 2013, he was more wrong than anyone when he said bern could beat the emailer. Didnt stand a chamce because literally everything he blames the Rs for doing the Ds already have. Stfu"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is a pathological liar
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk ride his horse there or did he wear him out??
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I grew up on the young Turks but cenk defends anything the establishment does if it keeps republicans out of office. The same way they cheated Bernie
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk ugyur is the Bill O’reilly of democrats, gets demolished in every debate, then starts shouting like a drunk idiot."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Those clothes must stink since Cenk wears it all the time
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"4:37 Why would the DNC care about “how hypocritical they look”, when they know that Dummies like you will continue to blindly vote for them ANYWAY, in Perpetuity, regardless of what they do? 😂"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Lex: ""Are you troubled by how Kamala was selected?""
Translation: How much of a hypocrite are you and lets see you trip over your own clubbed feet, and gooo.
Cenk: ""Diarrhea, word vomit, I'm a hypocrite for these 45 reasons.......but I don't care about actual democracy because as long as I believe the end justifies the means"""
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Why wouldn't Biden endorsed the 2nd in command? Lol wtf are you stupid?
EJ5tbKQeBKE,so basically Bernie is like jesu! forgives people loves the poor is a jewish carpenter
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Every said for years “I can’t believe it’s these two old farts again” the polls said a general republican would beat Biden and a general democrat would beat trump. Democrats at least had the decency to listen to everyone.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk always acts reasonable when he's talking to centrists and right wingers and then he goes back to his show and talks shit and slanders everybody, call them names, stawmans their position etc."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The most honest Cenk I’ve ever heard when he says Democrats don’t trust the people.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Remember Force the Vote Jenk?
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Lot of idiots in the comments. You guys are so uneducated
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"No, it was not. Avoid losing 20 min of your time, he just avoids stating the truth."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is lieing through his teeth and he knows Kamala is not a legitimate nominee.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk said it himself before on the David pakman show he said “let the best democrat win” it seems like his views have changed.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,If he wants someone sincere then why would he want Harris over Trump?
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The real question is:  Was Kamala Harris selected CONSTITUTIONALLY?  I believe she was NOT.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is a mess good lord
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"what an extraordinary lie, how stupid does he think we are?"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,AOC is a sellout.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"""The democrats don't trust the people"" So ironic lmao"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Ya'll in the chat mad you are stuck with Trump til he dies, lol. He owns your party. You dont."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"bernie doesnt attack or fight back for one simple reason, bernie is a career politician. Bernie knows he cant win so he doesnt try to win he knows he will lose and so makes peace with everyone to maintain his position he is above all a career politician and he knows he is a loser not only that he knows he is a performative politician"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"why dont people understand that people who enter politics as careers are freaks already, they are literally the sociopaths and losers at school, now imagine those people running the government and then imagine on top of that them thinking they know who would be a good candidate, they are clueless socially inepts psychopaths"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I'm done voting party lines; I'm voting for Trump this election.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk and anyone who listens to him live in a different world
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Something that gives me hope is that the evil kabal that tries so hard to control all of us (Neocons, CIA, Military Industrial Complex, current Democratic party, Republican party under George W etc) are actually... often times pretty bad at it, despite their efforts. They aren't invincible folks, we can fight them, we can win, and we can remain become a free people again. Our ability to express this very idea in this comment has been under fire for 4 years, and we cannot let this kind of government censorship continue! The winds are shifting."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"""I know democrats. They love to annoint... because they don't trust the people. They think the elites are geniuses, don't worry we'll pick the right candidate."" Yep, that sums it up. I will be voting Trump this time folks. I am a well educated member of the ""elites"" but I reject totalitarian dictatorships, and so should every American."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The Democrat party is anything but democratic people. Let's wake up to that reality.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Blames everyone else when the fact is his views just aren’t popular.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,She was elected vice president.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,AOC is the future of Blue team in the sense that she’s the next Nancy Pelosi
EJ5tbKQeBKE,AOC is a big old sell out
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk said that democrats like to anoint because they don’t trust the people. That’s not very democratic
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk, this is a ridiculous answer they skipped the primaries and appointed her with no choice that is not democratic. Put the candidates on paper have people vote and see the outcome. At least yhe Republicans did that even knowing trump would win its obvious he would win but they still went through the process. She did not ""earn"" it"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Lex’s suckiest interview — I’m now dumber for having watched
EJ5tbKQeBKE,We have to save democracy by defeating it. Just like when Bernie ran...
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk was against force the vote.  Cenk is only yapping but will tell us to vote for Kamala
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Obama literally had a party that claimed outright, “we will make him a one term president” and he served two terms. So criticizing him for “not delivering “ seems pretty ridiculous"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,In a presidential election it would have been soooooo stupid to give up all the money Biden raised. So dumb. Couldn’t have done it
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"lol, acting like Biden dropping out was his choice - come on. We all know better. This was always the plan - they wanted Kamala in 2020 and the ppl said Hell No. So the establishment said we’ll force her on you in another way"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Biden endorsed Kamala to upset Obama ,Nancy, and Hillary!!"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"here’s just a few of many: Repeatedly claimed he’s a retired command Sgt major, said he carried weapons of in war, claimed his 2 children were conceived via IVF, driving 96 mph in a 55 mph because he was being chased, told his men he would deploy with them to Iraq…… Tim Walz lies about everything sometimes for no reason at all"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Gotta love the “end justifies the means” people, right? Sad, sad liars.

There’s no excuse for the party who wants a full democracy, who wants to make voting easier, who wants the voting age dropped, and who wants less secure voting to never allow a democratic primary. If they believe in it so much, then they should prove it."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Bernie Sanders started every speech with, are you ready for a revolution. Then told people to vote for Joe Biden. That is absolutely ridiculous...."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"This argument of an open convention confuses me.

She was already on the original ticket, she was basically the backup qb for the team as a the qb was out going into the playoffs.

If your starting qb goes out the week before the Super Bowl, you don’t go to then transfer portal.

I mean the campaign finance regulations alone make the most sense to transfer to her as she was already on the ticket.

I think what all these people are butt hurt about is that Biden ran last time saying he was a one term president. After elected when he started running again, people felt betrayed because he wasn’t handing it over. Love him or hate him, he couldn’t have picked a better time to bow out. 

We all forget that taking out the debate performance, Trump was a candidate who just survived an assassination attempt and had just completed his convention.

People always bitch that Republicans will bend the rules to do anything to obtain power (such as stealing Supreme Court seats by not confirming a year of election and then confirming for theirs, gerrymandering, ect…).

At least this time, all rules and regulations were followed, and democrats weren’t afraid to do what was necessary."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I like Cenk Uygur.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The party that thinks they know better than their own constituents and doesn’t listen to what they want has no business being in charge.  We are supposed to be electing public servants.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Looking right straihht to your eyes saying "" what they should do and what they actually do"" 😂😂 shameless cynicism"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk is a deep state plant,  just like Destiny"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk is miserable to listen to. He is a snake oil salesman through and through. 

Saying stuff like “Trump ONLY does things that are in his own self interest” is just so ungenuine. The guy literally gave up his perfect billionaire lifestyle to be slandered, attacked everyday and have the left attempt to take everything from him. How can you say anyone that does that is acting in their own self interest and expect for people to think you have any actual intelligence, integrity, or even an ability to perceive. It’s truly unbelievable how people like Cenk spew all this nonsense with such fake confidence"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk sucks
EJ5tbKQeBKE,That Walz guy completely gives me the heebie jeebies..
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The spin from the $h!tlib community is hilarious. 😅
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Emphatically no. Not even close. If Biden dropped out of the presidency itself then by all means she should replace him and then run for the presidency after an emergency primary that allowed any and any contenders. Call them cute, dirty or conniving it was done with much calculation in mind and has never been done this way for a reason. It had nothing to do with the mind of the voters in consideration, but only how to explain it away."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Within only 1:34 he already said so many things that are the problem and why democrats are leaving the party.. and he is saying this out loud and knows what he is saying yet he still defends the democrats and Harris? The ignorance is astounding.. any rational person cannot say those few sentences and still think voting for Harris is a good idea.. the mental gymnastics these types of people do are beyond comprehension and insanity.. we all know he has a horrible case of TDS but how is he not worried about his own image and losing credibility just from a business standpoint.. I understand this is what he does and The Adolescent Turks only got bigger after Trump was in office because they trashed on him 24/7 they have never been credible in my opinion and I’m sure to a lot of people reading this, but to the small percentage of people that do like him and think he’s credible, trustworthy, honest and not hurting his reputation from a business standpoint I truly want to know why you think that and why you enjoy him. I am sure we won’t agree on everything, but from a regular democrat perspective you have to meet me in the middle about him ruining his reputation trying to die on this hill of hate Trump at all costs even if it doesn’t make sense or is completely false.. he won’t get off the TDS hill it’s so crazy to see.. 
Also all democrats should be ashamed and embarrassed by having a non elected official who you have to vote for in the presidential election.. not having multiple candidates try to win the primaries by YOU voting for who you think is best is communism.. you were GIVEN ONE person and ONE person only.. if that is not enough for you then you really need help.. you should have walked away from that party as soon as the banana republic corrupt courts started attacking the other person running for president.. if that’s not some third world shit then you all need to pick up a history book."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Chunk admits everything they do is unconstitutional. Aoc may be the most ignorant human pandering to very dumb ppl.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is such a cuck for the Dems. He pretends to be tough but in the end he takes what they give him.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"I ❤ Bernie still, too, but disappointed he didn’t stand up for himself better! He should have aligned with Green Party or something!"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,After listening to cenk not scream this time. I will never vote for another Democrat.  Ever.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The democrats are “too civil” -cenk
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Just realized this guy thinks he can beat up Joe Rogan
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Democrats say Trump is a Con artist and they pull this stunt! They make any excuse to validate themselves! If it was republicans doing it all media would be crying every single day! Also Cenk you had 0% chance of winning the election! You weren’t even on the ticket looser! Never in a single debate! Never ever did they talk about you! How you drop off like of you ever had a chance!
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Didn't realize how much of a grifter cenk was till recently, this guy ridiculous"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This guy is so funny hahaha. So many cintradictions. So when the dems do it its perfectly fine. He is more similar to to trump than he thinks
EJ5tbKQeBKE,TLDR: No
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"This is no different then when Biden was in last place of the democratic nominees bribing everyone else to drop out on Super Tuesday and getting 3-4 people to endorse him with delegates. 

Is it legal? Yes. Did they work for it? Barely."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"All the Republicans crying about democracy, and yet very happy with the electoral college 😂😂"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,She worked the delegates? That doesn't sound democratic to me at all. If anything it sound like something an authoritarian would do.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This guy is a moron
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Trump isn't a con man. He lost $ AFTER being president. The dems are extortionists. Most people are smart enough to see this, we aren't communists."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"So Cenk, what do you think about all the noise and commotion on the Democrat side about the notion that Donald Trump is danger for democracy. Isn't it double standards to be upset about him, while the Democratic party does the same."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Chenk is a joke. He keeps talking about democracy while propping up a very undemocratic process. He just cares about beating trump using any means possible. Typical leftist
EJ5tbKQeBKE,So only follow the constitution when it benefits your party. Got it
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Funny how the “election fraud” crowd suddenly cares about democracy
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"They love Bernie but Bernie is socialist/commie, hypocrite."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"If the Democratic party is so authoritarian, then how did Tulsi Gabbard become the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee?  I don't think you can have a successful party with outliers like Gabbard.  You have to have some structure, common objectives and values.  Consider the 2020 Democratic primaries.  There were so many challengers two sets of debates had to be set up.  It was worse than the Republican primary in 2016.  Since 2020, the Democratic party appears to have consolidated.  I note that AOC was endorsing Joe Biden to the end.  Because of her endorsement she may very well have a future at the top."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Still love Bernie. What a shame and waste of political power over  the lying Hillary.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"“It would have been a great primary: morally, constitutionally, etc.”"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is the democrats apologist....😂 anyone but trump is their mantra.😮
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The Bernie worship is also nauseating. I like him but he just couldn't broaden his appeal enough to capture a greater share of the state electors. People keep on talking like he won the contest and they took it from him.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk is such a stooge. Calling delegates asking for their support is not ""work"". Its simply Biden endorsed her which was 80% of the work, no one challenged her which is 15% then her asking for the delegates to declare before the convention is maybe 5%. It is wasn't democratic but it didnt have to be as the President was duly elected and he has a right to state who his endorsement is."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,A: no
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Just…nah
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"""They dont trust the people""


And here you are Cenk. Shilling for the party that doesnt trust the people."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Harris got the nomination because the money they had already raised for Biden wouldn’t have gone to any other candidate. Too much money involved to risk
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The DNC is a private party. Her getting the delegates of the party is not relevant to democracy. Democrats can still put in someone else's name if they hate Kamala that much.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk drinks his own koolaid
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"I think the US primary system is a terrible idea. By its nature it produces extremist candidates on both sides.

 The Democratic party doesnt have to submit to the whims of the far left voters who show up at primary elections. Its not good for the party, nor for the country."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This dude is a practicing authoritarian. Except he thinks he would be on the side of the powerful after he shills
EJ5tbKQeBKE,We call that a who do.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,It’s complete bs that she got to be the candidate without a single vote casted for her by the people. It’s outrageous and feels like a complete farce.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,“WOULD HAVE legitimized the protect democracy” argument
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Biden did not write the letter. Common.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Bernie doesn't care because he gets to campaign! The guy used campaign money to buy 14k copies of his own book!
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Regular Americans need to stop pretending they know how politics are supposed to be run.  Americans have been apathetic for seventy years.  Ya'll just need to watch, listen and vote.  When the votes are counted accept the results.  Don't act like a child that didn't get your way,"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Lex just said Walz was great!? Crackhead
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"The mental gymnastics conservatives and ""centrists"" (closeted republicans) are doing is pure insanity. They've managed to convince themselves that the integrity of our democrat process was undermined by a private political party aligning their delegates to select a new candidate, but that their idol Donald Trump's fake elector plot and Jan 6th as a whole wasn't a literal subversion of the peaceful transfer of power and the electoral process as a whole. 

The grifting is off the charts by Lex over the last few years. Softball after softball to conservative high profile guests, never giving any pushback on real issues and facts. While simultaneously digging at anyone left of center on his show with pointed questions and masquerading as ""the reasonable centrist."" It's obvious he just wants to be in the good graces of conservative tech bros and neo-establishment conservatives, but going full mask-off to tow the line between audiences while making his real believes known through implication. 

Cenk and liberals like him aren't the solution to modern democracy, but at least they hold principled positions and can articulate their arguments, instead of grifting pop politic social issues and fear mongering against immigrants.

Get a grip unhinged youtube comment conservatives. If you love America and possess any shred of critical thought and observation, Trump is not the answer."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The Left is saying Trump is Hitler and Kamala called Joe a rasist...yeehhh the Left is very kind😂😂😂
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"I'm glad to see no one in the comments fell for his BS smh hard to listen to someone like that, no accountability no own thoughts smh"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Its amazing how much Cenk knows how much of a joke that the DNC is, but still will only support them over the RNC"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The two candidates that I felt were the most intelligent were RFK and Vivek. They both have endorsed Trump. And Kamala wasn’t nominated legitimately in my eyes so it results in only one valid candidate.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,CIA talking points is all tyt does.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,There's no country in the world that ever had a democracy not hard to work that out all you need is common sense
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is a bit delusional these days
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Like Lex that you at least acknowledge Kennedy this wall loser waltz
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Like Lex that you at least acknowledge Kennedy
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Did he really said, it was wrong, but OK since she is capable? Like.. It is ok to do the wrong thing, unless you like that person?"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Supporting AOC geez...  Never
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"This guy lists off how unconstitutional democrats are, and still votes for them lmao 😂"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Technically legally but no not democratically. That's because the US is *literally* not a Democracy. It is a constitutional republic. We elect representatives. We do not vote on laws themselves. The people we elect do that.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"So critical of this, yet zero criticism for any of Trumps shit. It’s amazing."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"It's a simple answer, it wasn't democratic."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Brown dude is a hack
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This ass always say yes and  no🤣
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I just clicked on this to see what kind of laughable answer Cenk would give.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk can take a hike . He’s the type of left-wing people we don’t need.  He’s wishie-washie.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Lex really just said AOC was impressive? So much for the being soft spoken, intelligent guy."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk talks a lot of shit. Pro-union until his employees voted for it. Listen to him here, plugging his show left and right. When you watch his videos he is begging for money on every one of them. The dude is a millionaire and rails against them and corporations all the time but he is a corporation and a millionaire. I despise people like him."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"They knew of Biden’s decline and waited to the last minute to install Kamala. 
Democracy at its finest."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This guy is so full of crap that he even believes in the lies that he tells
EJ5tbKQeBKE,No and no she is a puppet plant strings all over her
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This guy is a complete dufus 😵‍💫 I'm glad he holds ZERO WEIGHT in real world matters.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Kamala nomination is an anointment. Cenk over hyped  kamala and gave her too much credit for her effort with the delegates just to add the facade that she earned the nomination through democratic process when clearly it's all scripted. I think the democrats delegates were ready to endorse her no matter because of identify politics.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The assumption what was done is ‘democratic’ is that Biden ‘dropped’ out. We all know he was told to drop out. A coup is not democratic.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Is Cenk really suggesting that the best they could do was to pick Kamala? One of the lowest ranked VP’s in history? Didn’t win any delegates last election? 

Kamala “secured the delegates” by telling them “if you don’t go with me, I’m going to scream racism”."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"No, she wasn't.

DELULU 😂"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk represents the dumb side of leftism.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Hiden dropped out because he got caught (interview-assassination attempt). Wimped away like a guilty dog. Harris is now hiden because she is not up to the job she has now.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk spews democracy is under attack.........except when it suits what he wants. All the posturing he does and then boom:  Its ok that Kamala wasn’t elected by the people.    Actor.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"4:03 ""they don't believe in letting their voters decide.""

Isn't that the definition of a dictatorship?"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This the guy that started hasan's career?
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"So CU, you believe MTG means what she says, and that makes her better than McConnell. Since when did a neo-Nazi conspiracy thug become praiseworthy by being genuinely loathsome?"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,So people did not choose wow
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"You can see the struggle to make it make sense. It will never make sense, Cenk."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Tim Walz is the most ingenious piece of garbage. Dude has lied about his military career nonstop
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"You are not a natural born citizen of the USA, what the heck is this talk about running for president? Hard to take a guy like Cenk seriously. Stopped watching after his delusional comments."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"This guy is not smart, hes educated,  but not smart."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Or dumbass
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Yes and no?? What a dumdass
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk is so wrong about Force The Vote. He can go on and on about strategy, yet he never ever ever had ANY real ideas about how to leverage any power to make ANYTHING change."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,wtf is this guy talking about 😂
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Harris should have picked Josh Shapiro as her VP Nominee and bag Pennsylvania electoral votes.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Give Cenk a gold medal for the gymnastics he does to arrive at Kamala.  Damn dude
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This guy is so cringe 😖
EJ5tbKQeBKE,This dude dropped out of a race he wasn't eligible for!! The fact that he ran in the 1st place means he should be in a institution somewhere but instead he is here giving opinions! That is what is wrong with the world today! People like him having platforms.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Like you on the right care about democracy. 😂
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk is a type of person who is pro dictator, pro socialist, pro big government infringe on people right, etc. He can't be trusted."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Bernie should be running for President
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"This is just ridiculous ""talking head"" bs.  This guy doesn't know what the hell he is talking about."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Didn’t like cenk back in the day but have learned many things listening to him and have came to respect him. This discussion seemed off tho. Cenk call your party out on all the bs that has been going on, hold them accountable and maybe they come back better next round. You’re not being real like you usually are in this one."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Did all the whining conservatives in the comments section even watch the video? He basically agrees with Lex.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,She was absolutely anointed
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"The problem is if EVERYONE at the White House knew of Bidens' mental decline 2 years prior and intentionally waited until the time had expired. Now we have a much bigger issue. You see how they try to put the blame on Biden, like if he had dropped out sooner, everything could have gone better. Biden didn't even know he was the president."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is such loser.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk creates nuanced explanations for common sense rationale. He’s always stretching weird explanations to try to stand out from the other cheerleaders in the mass media for the democrats. Yet his answer is always towing the party line.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk crushing it as usual. Not always right, no one can be but his finger is usually on the pulse like Michael Moore."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,The mental flexibility it takes lol
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"OMG, it’s embarrassing comparing this interview with that of Trump.  Lex pushed back a lot on Cenk (as he should) but then let Trump get away with non-stop lies and BS."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk himself speaks about the authoritarian nature of the Democratic party and how they anoint candidates.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"So Kamala deserves credit for locking up the delegates, whatever process that was. But the fact that she became the nominee without a single primary vote or even giving passionate detailed policy positions is highly problematic."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,AOC is definitely the future of the party. She sold out real quick. Nancy Jr in the making.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Dis they just call waltz....genuine?  Lmao...Holy fuck
EJ5tbKQeBKE,All that talk and word salad instead of just saying NO
EJ5tbKQeBKE,It’s amazing to me that anyone in this country. Actually cares what this loudmouth idiot has to say.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I agree with Cenk?! Shit…
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Even when I used to be left leaning as an independent I fucken hated this guy. Man is absolutely garbage
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Gross. Gross . Gross.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I thought democracy was the people selecting a candidate through some form of election where the people vote for who they want.  But I'm stupid
EJ5tbKQeBKE,She would have never worked with a Jew in Gov. Shapiro
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I liked you lex but you gotta push back on these people when they outright lied and are complete hypocrites.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"She was selected by people, not ""the people"". She lost her state in the primaries 2020 and didn't get one primary vote in 2024. Not one write in!!!!!!!!!!"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Hey everyone, so it looks like the guy that we put up for election through the official process is probably going to lose so we’re going to circumvent the official process by swapping someone at the last second who we think has a better chance

- democracy"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk says a lot of dumb stuff but i have to say, he and ana have been the only lefty liberals ive seen this election cycle whove atleast acknowledged the reality of the democratic party. dore too, ironically enough."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"not sure Cenk is accurate on the AOC prediction, only time will tell"
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Short answer, is no."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Democratic my a***
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Bernie is not a real person.  He is a puppet that belongs to the DNC.  He backs them to this day after they destroyed his chance at president.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk is a sellout.  His TDS blinds him
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cope harder Cenk. KH was 100% anointed. Complete elitist bullshit
EJ5tbKQeBKE,100k views. 1k likes… I think that says it all.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,In just 2 days......amazing efficiency. GTFOH
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Wow, Lex disappointed me. I'm surprised."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,I can't stand this guy. He is such an evil spirit.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk hates democracy. He openly supports the establishment that goes against it every chance they get.
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"AOC was, and is, nothing but a fame wh0re. That woman ran as a progressive and won, then immediately turned on her constituents the moment she started getting that government paycheck and started getting invited to do interviews, red carpets, reality tv shows, and rub shoulders with celebrities. Cenk is wrong about force the vote, even though I'm glad they didn't because I do not support M4A, because the point wasn't entirely to get M4A passed, but to reveal who was against it. This is how the republicans were able to oust Kevin McCarthy when he finally got the speaker position. They were able to get McCarthy to agree to certain terms they wanted regarding the speakership. This is what the democrats could have done, but it is very clear, especially after the ousting of Biden, that Pelosi still holds massive control over that party."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"Cenk in reality is a social worker at heart.
But practically he shoulda been a comedian."
EJ5tbKQeBKE,Cenk you were kicked off the balance in North Carolina because you are not a natural born United States citizen. You may be a citizen of the United States but you are not a natural born citizen that's why you got kicked off of the f****** ballot stop bitching and complaining about democracy when you guys couldn't even have an actual f****** primary at least Donald f****** Trump was elected by his delegates end the voters 14 million people voted for Joe Biden to run for president in 2024 and what did y'all do you said f*** that 14 million you don't give a f*** about what they say or who would they rather prefer to be their choice because if you did you would be calling out Democrats of bulshit about democracy. F*** democracy we live in a goddamn constitutional f****** Republic
EJ5tbKQeBKE,"I believe the reality is that none of the other candidates the DNC wanted to run for this election wanted to step up, like Gavin Newsome or Gretchin Whitmer. They are already making their plays for 28. I believe the Clintons, Obama, Pelosi and the rest of the DNC had no choice but to anoint Kamala because all the other people that wanted to run against her like RFK Jr, Sanders and Williamson are all too far left for them to stomach. I believe the DNC knows they are stuck with Kamala and I think they know there is a high chance she is going to lose, which is why they are desperately trying to hide her away from everyone because they know, like Biden, she is incapable of forming a coherent sentence, but at the very least can clearly read from a teleprompter. Her campaign is a house of cards, and it is on the verge of a total collapse. The foundation is already starting to shake with the CNN interview. Trump's favorability immediately started rising after that interview aired. It will completely collapse after the debate. Mark my words."

CcBLPjnmpfs,Looks like Craig showed up in shorts and tshirt and Lex had to lend him a suit
CcBLPjnmpfs,Both parties are going to lose RFKJR24
CcBLPjnmpfs,"Germans killed 8 million ukranians: Official data says that at least 8 million Ukrainians lost their lives: 5.5 - 6 million civilians, and more than 2.5 million natives of Ukraine were killed at the front by the NAZI.   The data varies between 8 to 14 million killed, however, only 6 million have been identified."
CcBLPjnmpfs,Imagine trying to stay optimistic about a war and then getting quizzed on US politics. That’s some next-level endurance.
CcBLPjnmpfs,"The only way to save Ukraine is to buy more merchandise off Trump….lol MAGA hats, Trump flags, Trump shirts, bumper stickers, etc…..what a con man Trump is but a hell of a business man taking advantage of stupid people."
CcBLPjnmpfs,"And how many of them are dead now?

Or do decades of lives lost not matter?"
CcBLPjnmpfs,We all know how the war will end.
CcBLPjnmpfs,"Jacque Fresco — 'Democracy is a con game. It's a word invented to placate people to make them accept a given institution. All institutions sing, we are free

CcBLPjnmpfs,Trump wants Russia to have Ukraine.
CcBLPjnmpfs,I wonder what the guys grandpa was doing during ww2...
CcBLPjnmpfs,Trump will stop the war because adults will be back in charge.
CcBLPjnmpfs,Trump will end this. Harris will continue te bloodshed.

CcBLPjnmpfs,Лекс!Поздравляю Вас с Днём Рождения! Спасибо Вам.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Thank God there won't be a fourth Obama term.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama has only spent our money !!! What have you done for this country to help americans ????NOTHING
Obama always lies and claims Trumps  good moves as his own..pathetic.."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"I am worried they are taking so long for the House, that they are trying to figure out to how cheat! I saw Nancy Pelosi saying to some women with a big smile on her face that they will get the House!"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Lol!😂
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Everytime Ben is on Fox it’s a reminder of how much America hates the Republican Party. 

Thank you Ben."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Harris is the biggest Traitor and Liar Ever !!!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Why is Obama shuddering? Seems like he is unsure what to say
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"All of you are so shortsighted morons, Trump will be literally the number 1 leader! Don’t you all understand that? He will be king of the whole planet! We’ll finally have peace in the world."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama doesn't sound as polished as he used to . Plus he's a jerk
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama needs to remove himself.  He is not part of this office anymore.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Why can’t ivy league politicians pronounce the word “to” correctly?
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Why do they keep saying Kamala is a black woman? Its been proven that she is NOT black what so ever! She's white and Indian. Her melanin comes from her Indian mother. She lied to get black votes. You can't trust someone who lies about so much, to run our country. Im terrified about how she would handle meetings with foreign leaders, with her ""word salads"". She has no idea what she is doing or what she is even talking about."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,You don't have to be a brain surgeon to realize Harris or Biden's administration is severely disabled by corruption. 😮  Who do they they think they are really. 😏
qtOdHYp-Fj8,What kind of health problem does Barack Obama have?  Why is he losing so much weight?  Is he HIV positive?
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Kamala REEKS of desperation 💯 put her in front of Putin and KIM jeong un what a joke!!!!!!!!! 🫏
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Kamala is still leading by few % i cannot understand this it must be totally rigged!!!!! Get your asses out there to vote for ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤TRUMP and take your neighborhood too!!!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I'm black and I Dont take days off from being black. Kamala has not admitted that she is black because she's not. Its very insulting.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama sounds stressed. He just wants another puppet term. F* him.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,But the economy is bad now so what the Democrats are trying to do is blame Trump for the current bad economy. A complete flip flop of what they were saying before about Bidenomics working.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,It's NOT anti-Semitic to be against some of Israel's aggressive policies.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama destroyed my Democratic Party with his divisive identity politics.  The rot started with him, and he continues to support it.  He forced me out."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Finally! Political posture backed with facts not fictional trickery like CBS and all that follows that line.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"I can not stand this person, sorry but ideology and defending war crimes is not Ok"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,WE THE PEOPLE see the deceit!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama !! GO HOME DUDE !!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Check Harris interview with Roland Martin.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama needs to go away already. He’s the one that sows division in our country
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I’m a 👴🏿and I vote TRUMP!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Barack Obama is a traitor for endorsing a bad, illegal, candidate ."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,DemoKrats=Anti-Semitic racists
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Guess it didn't work out between Obama and the Castro's after all.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Poor Barack Obama is ruining his former respected status by supporting this incompetent person.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama is a JOKE.  The Race Baiter needs to shut up and sit down.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Bonama is all of a sudden criticizing Kastro when he spent most of his life idolizing him. STHU
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Trump/ Vance best team! 2024 win!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,David Cameron wheeled him out to threaten us into remaining in the European Union...probably the biggest single factor in making us leave it...We're not stupid..we know he hates the British because of his supposed links to Kenya..this is the man who was petty enough to remove a bust of Churchill from the Oval Office...never seen a clearer case of Messiah complex.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Cbs stands for the Communist broadcasting system
qtOdHYp-Fj8,he lost because americans dont like commies
qtOdHYp-Fj8,ah da da da  ok obama
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I prefer peace and prosperity not war and inflation.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Geeze….I thought that was Obama talking to Kamala, my bad.."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,President Obama is so bad without a Teleprompter…
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"So the New York Times praises Kamala Harris for what they call her ""art of the dodge""? My mother used to love that paper. Now she would use it for cleaning up doggie do ‼️"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Barack Obama lately sounds like he is coming unglued.  I remember when presidents retired,  and were actually retired."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Is that the silver tongued devil who likes to tickle the ears of the foolish, talking about Obama of course."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Here's the deal IMO. Dems lie so much they confuse themselves. i.e. cannot keep up with their own lying commie Marxist verbage.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama fake from day one.  Trump has given more than Obama has and ever will.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,What stupid comments
qtOdHYp-Fj8,If Kanala wanted to gain the peoples respect she would have invoked the 25th and removed Biden from office but  she didnt and it just proves shes a liar and in denial/ delusional
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Haven't you noticed that kamala's campaign is more or less ""Threatening"" Americans with chaos, right?

Like kamala is literally saying Biden's presidency failed, that she is a FAILURE, and that she has all intention of deliberately maintaining the current rate of failure within the country... and that will WILL vote for it, and we WILL accept it.

Isn't it starting to seem like these people are just weaponizing migrants and the intentional destabilization of America against us."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I hate Obamas🤬
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"I called it as soon as I saw kamala as biden's VP those years ago.
They would attempt to install her into power on the principle that she was a woman, and black, and that everyone MUST vote for her. It's quite literally Obama 2.0 and its note even out of the question that he is the one calling shots. incompetence and borderline self-absorbed evil."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Latinos for Trump!!!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama has lost all credibility.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Always with her Finger Wagging...like Bin Laden and Obama....wag wag wag wag wag   touch YOUR COCAINE nose every minute
qtOdHYp-Fj8,OH A FAKE NEWS MONITOR .
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama is desperate and out of his mind.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,The gaslighting by the Democratic Party is beyond comprehension!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"As Jewish kid, my whole community voting for Trump! 🇺🇸"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Yeah vote for people just because their color and race! Ty Obama
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Word salad Obama Shirley must be talking about Harris.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Harrison on live ifowars on umble. Has the . Gov. Obama Birth cert. Video report. So fake. Trump was right all along. And 
Candy O has the best reports on KH.  She, C Owens deserves an award for her reports."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,And. No one likes him now.  Thats obvious
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"NO, what his doing is arming women with a weapon against men. That's as low as you could go because that's a betrayal of all men."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Barry's a thug. Always has been. No different than P. Diddy.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,It’s crazy how people can’t see these people are trying to bully and fool us black people into voting for them it’s a joke
qtOdHYp-Fj8,thanx Ben
qtOdHYp-Fj8,dems lie soo muc 3:04   they dont lmow🤣The truth
qtOdHYp-Fj8,obummr is a looser
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Their only arguement is that trump ruined things for them.. 12 of the last 16 years  has been obama/ biden / kamala. trump only had 4 years to do things.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,That’s horrible he should not let him live with ordinary people.nyou are really sick. You should think about if it was you.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"As I white dude, I could only imagine being a black male, being told what to think. They literally treat Americans, specifically black Americans, like they are idiots and don’t think for themselves. If I was a black dude, I would be highly offended. Remember, this is also the same  party who said requiring an ID card to vote is racist, because they don’t think black people are smart enough to obtain an ID. ITS F*cking crazy."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"It took Obama 6 years to get the economy going. Because of all the government regulations, this was the worst recovery ever after a recession."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Kamala is even more corrosively toxic than just a few days back ! She quoted Lenin gladly . This is frightening in the sense that she is really bad not just bad . Lenin of Communist Russia years ago .
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"TRUMP IS A LEADER, HARRIS HAD HER CHANCE AND THEY FAILED! 
WE THE PEOPLE ARE DONE SUFFERING UNDER THE DUMOCRATS !!
TRUMP/VANCE WE ALREADY KNOW THEY WILL WORK FOR US!!
2924 TRUMP🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I voted for Obama NOW I can't stand his voice.!!!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,So Trump wont support orher countries' wars and this guy doesnt want him because of that?
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Be sure to vote and watch the election carefully. I would not put it past the Dems cheating yet again.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama sees himself as a power broker. The Dems think he's some sort of Jedi. Any rational thnker looks at him and says, ""Nah."" Not only would I not have a beer with Obama, I'd tell him to save his breath. Not interested."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Blah blah blah...
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Let's see Kamala's mental health records!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Even God is voting for Trump !
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"The Only Steal sent fake electors to DC, plotted to steal votes and voting machines, plotted and executed J6 insurrection, and schemed to “find me 11,780 votes” in a swing state"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"“Fascist to his core”
- General Milley,  the highest-ranking officer in the US Armed Forces and the principal military advisor to the president"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Mr Businessman has filed 6 bankruptcies and owes $1.3 B today (Forbes)
*scam-fail-bail-repeat*, happy to take your $, it’s a scam and ego trip, you know*"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"“Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States “, - Mike Pence, VP
HIS VP KNOWS HES UNFIT !!"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Trump says the national guard and military should be used against the people…, our forefathers are turning in their graves"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Fully HALF of Trumps former cabinet either refused to endorse him or are actively working against his reelection, you think you know better?"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,MY WIFE ROARS AT ME THEREFORE I HATE HER
qtOdHYp-Fj8,The funny thing is he said exactly what conservatives say about kamala harris 😂
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Harris is Black?
qtOdHYp-Fj8,❤❤❤
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Fema has failed America
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Trump or Kamala aside, i can’t wrap my head around the US supporting Israel (ethnostate) while the US is claiming to be a non ethnostate."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Kamala is awful for the country!   You know it! We all know it! Vote Trump - she’s got to have too have gimmicks now to get people to vote for her,  big mistake, and Obama?  He’s the only one who  made millions and billions!   so much for all the joy and hope and togetherness that he was going to bring. It  never showed up."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Trump 2024!!!!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama was a bad president..! Go home... so annoying 🙄
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Dems logic: If Trump did anything good, it was actually them. If they did anything bad, it was actually Trump."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama fing commi
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Canadians for Trump
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Adding to Ben's point about Obama claiming ownership of Trump's economy, Obama owes his economy to George W. Bush, by his own logic."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"So it’s we only view ,see and hear about the elections what you want us to believe since you can edit what we see and hear????"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Those are 
 old washed up ex presidents that nobody cares about anymore.They just don't know when to go away and shut the f*** up"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Shut up alabama your a liar a sick dude
qtOdHYp-Fj8,It is much easier for kamala to criticize DJT  than to be 'positive' about what she is not going to 'positively' do.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"You were given more grace than any American president first black man, and after your disaster,who cares"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama may be a worse president than Biden because he used his talent to wreck the country
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Sounded like he was talking about kametoe get out and vote red people I did
qtOdHYp-Fj8,The only person that I've ever heard.The word salads is kamala harris
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"B.O making a comparison of Trump with Fidel Castro, when he went with his family to shake hands and hug Raul Castro and all other Cuban atrocious dictators? His words and actions are proof of evilness at its finest. Shame."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,The leval of racial discrimination over the years is abhorrent.  It wasn't like that. We were better.  Now it's so bad.  Vote Trump 🗳 ☑️.   Trump isn't a racist.  Trump 2024 🎉.  May God bless the USA 🇺🇸 🙏 this election.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"2:03 Yes no one is ""undecided on Trump"" but I assume there's still a lot of people who dislike both parties or both candidates and are constantly re-evaluating which way their scale tips"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,maybe even jimmy carter will come to Kamala's aid
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Barack Obama came out in the open showing his true colors that this is between him and Donald Trump. Obama served 2 tearms as president and now he's  serving through Joe Biden. Wanting another 4yrs he's now campaigning for Kamala. Too much is never enough.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Can you IMAGINE if Trump or a supporter said ""what are you thinking?! If you're white you should vote for Trump!"" HOW DO PEOPLE NOT SEE THIS?!?!?!"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"if I can vote, I will vote Trump. I cant think of any reason Kamala is worth voting."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Go Obama, and keep the change! He’s done so much damage to our country and is still at it."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama the  OG racist and divider.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Oh yes more eyes are wide open and the truth is clear

qtOdHYp-Fj8,Go to bed obama you need sleep

qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama: hope dare all you black people NOT VOTE FOR THE DIRECT DESCENDANT OF THE CRUELEST, MOST VILE, MOST EVIL, MOST SUCCESSFUL SLAVE PLANTATION IN ALL OF JAMAICA  OF ALL TIME!!! 😂😂😂"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama should have said "" rollin down the street voting for bitches sippin on gin and juice"" and then they would relate to him and do it, and he could have gave some policies like raising the amount of goods you can steal without being prosecuted instead of just attacking trump, they want policies"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Downfall of dishonest phucks
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama talks about Kamala 😮=projection! TRUMP 2024🇺🇸
qtOdHYp-Fj8,The problem is the Biden admin the Shadow govt and the media are all united against Trump being President again. They fear him
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Well, Barack Obama wanted to fundamentally change the country remember people hope&  change, well, he did the country no good he made it worse and because of his election starting with him the country just got worse. It was only good when Trump was in  for those four years minus his Covid time."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Anybody defending Obama so fanatically is got issues ..
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"NBC sucks to, they are trying to make Trump look bad and it makes me sick"

qtOdHYp-Fj8,bronco bummer and his dude micholle
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I am already excited about JD Vance running for President in 2028!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama is on stage stuttering and stammering like he’s just a few steps behind Joe Biden, Kamala is screaming at rallies like she’s having a total meltdown, and pervert Clinton is agreeing with Trump about illegal immigrants. Sounds like the Democrat machine is running on empty. 😂"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Who knew that dodging the question would be the art of the deal
qtOdHYp-Fj8,God sent a strong delusional spirit to the demonRats so they would believe lies Kamala is telling them. Christians are not buying her bull shits.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Where are all those
Book copies of  the    WIFE  OF  THE  DEAD   PERSONAL  LONG TERM FRIEND  
AND  HIS PERSONAL  C H E F 
 FROM  THE    WHITE HOUSE  TO

qtOdHYp-Fj8,Camela (1 hump or 2 ) she is campaigning claiming our President Donald Trump is using divisive rhetoric. Here she is doing it herself. How in the heck is anyone voting for her?
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama Not You Either. He doesn't like your word salad either kh.😮🤮😡😵‍💫
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I thought Obama was talking about himself at first.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I'm surprised Obama hasn't come out and revealed he's married to a transvestite... That might curry favor even more in this day and age 😅
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama is desperate, what a sook"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Lmfaooooo!!!! Obama trying to repurpouse Harris's patented ""word salad"" to throw at Donald Trump is sooooo pathetic"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"The New York times is impossible to take seriously given their words regarding our constitutional foundation, after all they remain a paper, opinionated, ok so does the daily news and post  although up and coming pioneers are truly interesting, accurate, reliable and a great source, its so nice we have diversity of choices, cool. Some past presidents wrestle with not being in the lime light, popular if you will, it is what it is yet no reason to complain  in a corrupt manner that does not apply, hence the response was so low key ."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I'm pretty sure no one likes Obama anymore. We see now how he deceived us.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"I despise Obama for attacking Mr. Trump. Obama is a has been who chooses to not live near black people like himself but instead, lives comfortably among rich white people. Obama is a huge arrogant hypocrite! Why does Obama think anything he says is so important that we must listen to him? Obama is completely “IRRELEVANT!”"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Fax news the best
qtOdHYp-Fj8,You got to be an absolute imbecile or psychopath at this point to vote for Kamala Harris
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Kam ""ALA"" and O'BUMMER are the SAME ""HOLE"" with the SAME ""O"", SAME ""O""  PERIOD! 👎👎👹👹Devils In Plain Sight!"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Everything Obama said sounds like he's  describing Kamala Harris... except for the 2-hour part, she doesn't have the stamina or the brain power..."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Even when I wasn't into politics I remember when Obama was President and he was giving 62 billion to Iran to not make nuclear weapons at that time and they're still doing it today. I don't know it's not clear to me but isn't giving money to somebody give them more opportunity to do something
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Ben Shapiro is exaggerating what he said. He does that a lot, I wish he was just honest."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Holy hell I can’t stand listening to Obama.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,TRUMP WILL UNBURDEN US FROM WHAT HAS BEEN.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"That idiot studders a lot =====  I AM VOTING FOR DONALD J. TRUMP, VOTED FOR HIM IN 2016 AND I PLAN TO VOTE AGAIN 2024 FOR TRUMP!!!!  Ob get a life yourself and give up your puppets and let a person who knows how to make a country great instead of tearing it apart, do the job in peace this time.  I even voted for you that first 4 years NEVER the second time around."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Yeah...her not answering questions doesn't work in politics. People are looking for transparency, not defending secrets. People are tired of being kept out of the loop, lied to, and looked down upon by politicians who dont think people can handle the truth or deserve the truth. Trump is brash but with that transparent. The democrats are known sugar coaters. People respect honesty"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Kamala laughing and saying to the person they are at the wrong rally "" person stated Jesus is Lord"""
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Oh shut up Obama we are sick of you and will be glad to see you go ! You are a done deal so leave you have no business in our current elections. You weren’t even a good president! Why did you come back ?What is it gonna take to get rid of you? You are just as corrupt as the Biden.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,The biggest lie ever told by Democrats is that Critical Thinking makes you a conspiracy theorist.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"THANK YOU BLACK MEN, WOMEN, YOUNG AND OLD. YOU WON'T BE SORRY VOTING FOR TRUMP. CHANGES WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT UP TO A YEAR THEN HEALING WILL HAPPEN TO AMERICANS."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,都在预料之中。没有不作弊的民主党。美国的问题已经不是选票能解决的。
qtOdHYp-Fj8,No one cares what obama says or thinks.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Trump 2024 America first ! MAGA !!!!!
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Trump 2024
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Trump 2024
qtOdHYp-Fj8,But only people watching FOX News will ever see or hear this.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I have stopped watching any news channels other than Fox. Because I'm tired of getting false information from other commentators
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"More ""desperate"" than trump trying to talk nikki haley (whom he completely trashed) to support him?"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I don’t find anything good or positive about  Obama
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama said, ""Those jobs aren't coming back. You'd need a magic wand.""

Donald Trump brought manufacturing jobs back to America!
Trump boosted the economy that Obama wrecked."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama is a liar, a fake a crook and a loser. He is clearly a sociopath if not a psychopath. No center, no heart, just a robot taking orders from evil. Who is he to even mention Trump's name. What an absolute arrogant fool. He lied his way into office and was seen through by the end of his term by everyone I knew who originally fell for him. His own state was trying desperately to get the word out about him when he first ran."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,God bless America
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Obama thinks he's God but it will come back to bite him in the ?
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama is a tool , we just need to ignore him and pay attention to those who follow him like a lemming."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,I REMEBER WHEN FIDEL CASTRO HAD A TWITTER
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Why isn’t FOX News sharing Candace Owen’s information debunking that Kamala isn’t even 0.1% black? Hmmm? She’s Irish and Asian Indian! It’s a lie in her book that her grandmother is black. Her grandmother not black. Look it up in her ancestry. 😮
qtOdHYp-Fj8,its not about color or gender its about the future of this country
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Just campaigning on higher taxes you have to be a moron. And that's after they ruined America.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"‘Word Salads’ are a product of Kamala.
If you gave me a black woman like Winsome Sears or Dr Carol Swain I would cheer her on as far as she can go.  
But you give Kamala Harris?  No thank you."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"He actually said ""Word Salad"".  That is called projecting.  When are we going to discuss psycological warfare?????"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,democrats have no personal identity if you dont like them it has to be cause of a group identity issue not that single persons faults
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Kamala is quick on her feet 😆. She didn’t answer the question because she’s stupid
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Actually, Obama had to cheat to win"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"Obama could have used his money and popularly to help so many people, but instead he just shows up out of nowhere to scold people. Nice move sir"
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Does anyone disagree that israel are a bunch of terrorists.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,"The idea that politician's can only represent their group,  precludes that none of them represent the bottom 66% of the population that is living paycheck to paycheck. The middle class is only 25% of the entire population at most. and both candidates represent the top 1% of the population. This proves this is insane."
qtOdHYp-Fj8,The left wants you to vote for a women........but can not define a woman......that says it all.
qtOdHYp-Fj8,For one she is not a black women .she is a want to be black women .
qtOdHYp-Fj8,Black guy voting for Trump because America first and this is my HOME 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Having the whole media against him and for Harris and winning anyway thats so badass
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I bet ben is getting a fat check from putin
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I still think it's pretty sad just how close it was. 47-48% is extremely concerning
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Ben gonna hawk tuah❤ trump
5yzkXzPBf7Y,🍊 🇺🇸🫡
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Love how Ben runs through the stats/facts on Trumps jorney back to the WhiteHouse it is pretty incredible.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"I am a Hong Kong migrant in the UK. My understanding of U.S. politics is quite limited. For a long time, I mostly heard about topics like ""Gaza"" and ""Kamala is leading in the polls"" on BBC and Sky News UK. I thought that in the U.S., the ""woke"" perspective was the majority view, while people with conservative and Judeo-Christian values were in the minority."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Dear Ben,

I feel like you should do a ‘Facts’ episode debunking all the myths surrounding trump and his policies. 

I’ve been seeing so many false things on social media about his policies. It’d be nice for you to do a series showing what his policies are and what they aren’t!"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"I'll give it to Trump, he managed to fool half of America into voting in a sexist over a Black Woman. This shows how truly horrid this country is. Please help us fix this country in the midterms. Trump is a danger to this nation, and he needs to go. Anyways, on a brighter note, I can vote in 4 years, and I'll vote out whatever Trump-like scum the Republicans throw at me then! Yeah, that's all. Trump, ggs, but don't ruin the country, despite how hard it is for you not to."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"This is just beautiful. You have a very pleasant voice.
Praise God!
Thank you for sharing.
God bless you both.
Tammy
🤍👑🤍"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"The American constitution is a failed project. That has been proven over and over again. Then rather than shred and rethink, you blame others. Yet another example of its failure. It’s time for the world to distance its self from the USA and its morally bankrupt culture. Other countries in the middle east has more sense than Europe. God bless the UK and not the USA."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,When will you admit Biden stole 2020.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Andrew's reaction to Trump's win is everything!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Kamala had Beyoncé Monica, Lady Gaga Usher spike Lee Tyler Perry, Taylor Swift, Barack Obama, Michelle, Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney, Stevie Wonder, LeBron James, and so on Trump kicked all of their butts. He has the senate the house and he is our president 👍🏿"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Hallelujah.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,That one bald guy??😱
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Congrats on electing an insurrectionist. America has completely lost sight if its fundamental values.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I'm glad trump won...BUT LOOK a cadre of ALL YT MEN....and some semi white men who are hated by other yt men...but yet still hate other non yt men....so smart
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"I still can't get over the 300 parody video, in which Donald Trump speaks about Ben Shapiro."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Hopefully , Tulsi will become Secretary of State . 
Vivek is the ideas guy . 
."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I'm Brazilian but I'm proud of Americans for going out to vote for Trump. God bless America!  Let's fight socialism world wide.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,My brother said he felt like he just gave birth.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Democrats have mover too far left, forcing their ideas on the rest of the country.  Trying to force people to agree with your craziness and expect us to not push back."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"We need you to take a turn at press secretary. You are so quick on your feet, intelligent and supreme debater. The fake news won't know whether to cut bait or fish."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Hello everyone, congrat from Kiev Ukraine. Wee hope that Tramp will help our country in this war! Thanks to american people who was help Ukraine"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"the only problem I have with trump is how much of a priority he gives Israel, that little country is not our concern no matter what justifications they try to give us"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I’m a proud Christian God fearing patriotic Englishman and this past year I’ve seen the western world under attack. I’m so happy that President Trump has won! God bless America and all the good people that make up the western world 🙏🏼🇺🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇮🇱💪🏼 it’s time to fight back against Satan and his evil
5yzkXzPBf7Y,The most rigged election and werw gonna see a recession to the likes we've never seen before
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Why is it unbelievable??? Are y'all really this dumb?? Government and elections are like the WWE. Everything is scripted.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,They won't learn a thing.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Let the truth and justice prevail. Divine justice based on the truth coming out to the light. Amen. Let it be this way. 🙏✨☀️🕊️
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Less than one inch and that bullet could have killed Trump.  At that time I thought God did step in and blessed him. I had a strong feeling that Trump would win the Presidency at this crucial time in American history.  And did he ever !!!  I hope President Trump will acknowledge God always for paving his way to the Presidency.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Niceee, welcome back DONALD TRUMP!!! 🎉🎉🎉  USA❤KOREA"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,We did it!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"All you Men need to take 4 years out of your regular life and run for an office position. Thank you all for supporting President Trump and helping him win. Ben Shapiro isn’t it time to pay up your bet and buy Jesse Lee Peterson his lunch. Maybe you can vlog that moment. You have come a long way from being a never trumper, to being one of his biggest advocate. God Bless you all 😌🙏🏽❤️🦁🇺🇸🌟🕊️"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Orange cares about everyone!❤️🇺🇸
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Quick questions trump supporters since trump won and got house and congress and doesn't do what he said he was gonna do. Will he be the biggest flop?
5yzkXzPBf7Y,We need to keep on praying for Trump's safety and protection for his family and administration. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
5yzkXzPBf7Y,She can go back to her middle class family.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,One day middle east will dominate the world like ancient day
5yzkXzPBf7Y,God bless Donald Trump 😊
5yzkXzPBf7Y,How Come Trump Didn't say to Harris your FIRED..............
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Boooooooooooooooooooooom!!! Thank the lord!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,We Finally can get rid of the Woke B.S America can Heal again. It was a landslide.Evil Never Wins God Did not let that Evil Witch Harris WIn. Trump is Going to Heal America. God Bless America.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,So true. Congratulations to American people 👏 🙌. You proved when the people are united miracles happen. You gave hope to others all over the world 🙏 ❤️ 💙 ♥️ ✨️
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I received an email from my college offering support and resources for this tough time 😂
5yzkXzPBf7Y,You are all delusional if you think Trump is the saviour.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"We all need to face the ultimate reality in this election.  We did not defeat Kamala (or Joe), but we did defeat those who are their puppeteer handlers.  Face facts, neither one of them had the intelligence to hold the office and perform the job properly without being told what to do every step of the way.  This became self-evident when Kamala was asked what she would do differently than Joe Biden and she responded by saying that she would do nothing differently.  This was clear evidence that she was under the control of her handlers at all times."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Indian Here: loved this historical comeback of Donald Tump I am a Modi supporter here & see that both Trump & Modi are hated by liberals & leftists on same narrative of being a dictator & a Nazi. Loving the leftist Meltdowns
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"The left has long detailed how gross the right is, so I've no need to rehash old stories/facts. I'd just like to note that I'm writing a research paper (criminology). One section of it covers public punitiveness regarding guilty police. An area of my predictors/explanations section covers how right wing Americans are far less punitive toward police misconduct (suggested to be, at least in part, because Caucasians view police as assisting in their desire to remain the dominant racial group). So well done guys. You think nothing of women, you let a fake deity guide your every move, you favour firearms over children's lives, and an officer who beats a victim ""isn't *that* bad"". Grubs."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump and the American people!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Hey! Korean here as well!. Thank you, America. God bless you wonderful beautiful country and the 47th president 🇺🇸"

5yzkXzPBf7Y,"If you don't believe in science you might want to take a good long think on that one. Yes I prefer Trump. But in Deity absolutely not. 
Read a textbook not a bible."

5yzkXzPBf7Y,The American Fascist Movement Has Begun

This is bigger than DJT, folks."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"I can't wait and i mean The World, so excited about Diddy's Case...please Presiden Trump, bring the light, Protects our generations..
Congratulation Mr. Presiden & Vice President Trump-Vence"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Shema America, Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. And He is with you."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,What America needs are more people back to church or synagogue.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Ben is pretty emotionless. He doesnt look happy !
5yzkXzPBf7Y,We aren't done yet. They will try everything in their power to get him out. We must prepare for the future as well.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Remember that a Muslim majority city painted the map where they lived red.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"sorry ben,   hardcore trump supporter here but I am not going to believe in sky wizards any more than i believe in ghosts"

5yzkXzPBf7Y,Victory for Israel !
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Bro my moms been acting upset all day cause she voted for Harris, she goes on this long speech of racism and sexism and him being a pig and I just say then why did the highest record of people of color vote for him? And she says I don't know but that's a problem we need to figure out... What Ben said would happen happened, they're blaming the people of the United states."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Wow, everyone is real excited for a felon to be elected, sad"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Amazing Ben. His going to buy you a cushion now so you can get eye-level with the camera.

Yes Ben, invoking that this was somehow divinely ordained...there's no low you'll go to suck at the tit of corporate greed."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Now Let's Make America Great Again!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Latinos for Trump
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Today, germany is sad and disappointed"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"As someone who is on the left, I would just like to point out that Kamala did actually concede when she lost and if you think we're done, you're fucking nuts. We lost this time but we will be back and we are not giving up on this country. If Rome survived Nero we can survive Trump for another 4 years"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Well done Americans!!!! you made the right choice. Aussie patriot.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,MAGA MANDATE❤🎉
5yzkXzPBf7Y,viva trump

5yzkXzPBf7Y,THANK YOU GOD AND PLEASE KEEP TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY SAFE SO HE CAN DO THIS JOB!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Trump is the left!!! Tariffs, anti-war, anti-international trade deals, his views are a mix between Sanders and the lefties of the 2000s who didn’t want to take out bin Laden or Hussein. He doesn’t care about free markets, the military, or worthwhile military pursuits. I can’t believe people fell for that leftist."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,❤❤❤🥂🩷🩷🩷
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Thank you for what you've done to call out the lies.   Whew.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,There is no god Ben. Voted for trump though even though god disgust me.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,צודק בכל מילה ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"“In 244 years, nothing has changed. Yes, we are flawed. Yes, we are cruel and generous and brutal and gentle and cynical and idealistic. But most of all, we must not be enemies. We must be Americans—Americans together—and we will be so again, when we are touched by the better angels of our nature.“ ❤️🤍💙"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Why would god save trump and not the innocent bystander
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Trump supporters left no doubt. Undoubtedly, the left will be totally unhinged. What a great day for America and thank God!"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Democrats don't realize how scary their policies are to so many Americans.  Maybe step back from the LGBTQ movement and what it is advocating for the education and medical services offered to children.  Step back from Defund the Police.  Step back from Open Borders.  Step back from weaponizing the DoJ to persecute your political rivals.
This was the Democrats election to lose... and they lost."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,He persisted.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Guess Grover Cleveland isn’t the only President that had a split term now!

5yzkXzPBf7Y,Praise God!!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Great video. I too think God watches over our country.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"This is a reprieve to buy us some time, and what will we do with the time we have left? REPENT & IMPROVE or to act: ""As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly."" Prov.26:11 KJV"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Am I dreaming? Someone pinch me!!! I'm so happy I can't believe it!!! Thank God thank God thank God!!! Well done America!!! Now you're talking!!! 😎
God bless you all!! 🙏
President Trump has too many powerful enemies, we better keep praying for him!!"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"I hope we all know that it doesn't matter who is in the 'top job' because this is a systemic problem -- greed. We have allowed many of our economic sectors, to take advantage of the American people. It's disgusting and frightening for the future of our country. My husband and I will be retiring in the next two years in another country. We are absolutely worried that SSI will no longer be funded under Trump. we'll have to rely on his pension, a 403 (b) and a very prolific lnvestment account with my Tracy Britt Cool Consulting my FA. Our national debt is bloating and expanding every month. Our government needs to get spending under control and cut the federal budget."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Why is there so much animosity in politics? It's all just insults, finger pointing, and very little good. Just for reference, I voted Democrat this election, but I know plenty of people who voted for Trump, but I don't hate any of those people or anything of the sort. It's just something I never understood really. I feel like more would get done if, as the old saying goes, we all could just, get along, and work together, and find meaningful solutions for a better future."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"All darkness will come up to the light because Luke 12:2-3 says:

“There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.”

And that’s what happened. No matter the things they threw at Donald Trump, anything from impeachment to assassinations to anything they called him, Jesus’ hand was on him and it goes to show, what God has decided no man can change. God deposes kings and raises up others. Look at what Daniel 2:20-23 says:

“Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him. I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.”

Thank you Jesus! This reminds me of when God turned everything around for the Israelites  against their enemies in their camps. He always made a way when there was no way! And I have felt in my heart that no matter what people say about Trump and what they think about him, God sees and knows peoples hearts and just like King David lived a life far from perfect, God showed him grace and called him a man after his own heart because he humbled himself and repented and really loved God, put him first, the same way God chooses Trump today."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Love you and your show!  Ditch the cigars and booze.  “No drugs, no booze, no cigarettes.” To quote our 47th President.  Great advice.  Y’all look like a bunch of kids trying to be bad.  Not a good image.  Make America healthy again begins with each one of us.  Teach your children well……."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,We did guys! (I didn’t vote)
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Thank You God - pray for our leaders safety!!!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"I'm not even from USA don't live there, but I was seriously worried about that election, it was a relief seeing trump win,,, ufffff thanks 🙏"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I am glad Trump is back. My tax money won’t go to poor people. Economy will get a sugar boost. Learn to play the markets losers.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,We are unburdened by what has been!!!!!!!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Thank you Lord God Almighty!

Maybe Trump is considered better than other presidents, but he is still a bad person"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Thanks you did a good job.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,MAGA!!!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
5yzkXzPBf7Y,You guys are so funny.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Project 2025 is all over Twitter 

Like it’s a cesspool on Twitter like if Kamala won I would be sad but would accept it and move on. 
It’s even more sad since if Kamala won we would be bitching like they are now."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,How do I explain to people that A Trump presidency is not as bad as they put it?
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Guess Kamala will have to work at McDonalds...
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Congratulations, America!
The world was watching, and we still are. The real work begins. Gives us hope here in Canada that we can bring it home and be rid of our dictator wannabe. 🇨🇦🇺🇲"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Thank goodness!!!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,So sorry you feel obligated to light up a cigar.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Good news, I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word (Jesus) and believes Him who sent Me (God) has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24 Jesus died for you, all you have to do is believe & repent."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,That was fun we should do an election every year
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"It’s one of the best mornings in my life! I am literally crying with happy tears! My fellow American warriors fighting for freedom and justice, well done! Let’s take our nation back with beloved President Trump!!! 🎉🎉🎉"

5yzkXzPBf7Y,I wear orange on Election Day. Might wear orange for the next 4 years.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I can finally breathe ever since they announced that Trump is once again our president! God bless America!!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I am so relieved and happy. I don't get why liberals are so upset and sad. Apparently they watch the fake news. It's sad when you can't tell the truth from lies.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,The Trump Triumph!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"This is nothing short of a miracle from God, despite all the struggles, the lawsuits, the assasinations, trump persevered and Won in a landslide! Thanks to the true Americans 🇺🇸"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,THE RIGHT IS SO BACK!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Finally we are rid of obama.  Obama, the puppet master, has now lost ALL his little puppets."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Gd bless you al
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"We the People are not going to ever forget, Ben that you were a diehard never Trumper. Your arrogance and elitism hopefully has been destroyed and replaced with common sense and humility."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"The last time a Democrat President served a full term, voluntarily left office, and had the satisfaction of seeing another Democrat elected and hold on to the White House, thus suggesting that he'd done a decent enough job during his term, or terms, to not sour the nation on the Democrat Party:  Andrew Jackson in 1836
 
In that same timespan: 5 Republican Presidents have done so.

Edit, sorry - 5 not 6 (I forgot Warren G. Harding died in office). But still."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Registered Dem. Voted Trump. Jumped off the clown cruise.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,God is not dead! Praise God for Trump winning!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Great job Ben and all the youtube spreading truth instead of fake nazi news on all networks
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Too big to rig!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,It’s almost as if not accepting any interviews and not saying anything in the interviews that you take but irrelevant gibberish and bad things that aren’t true about your opponent is a BAD thing to do when running for President 🤯
5yzkXzPBf7Y,It’s interesting that the whitest states in the US are democrat/blue…
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"It took me SO many attempts to watch this video whilst constantly getting the ""Watching videos with paid product placements, sponsorships and endorsements"" message.

I've never seen this before."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
5yzkXzPBf7Y,WHEN YAKOV IS high  eisav  goes  down ! HASHEM blesses TRUmp
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"America needs mental facilities to be back, to be honest."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"IMAGINE if Washington State had Dave Reichert win the governor race. As a resident of the state of Washington we really missed out. The lies the Democrats were spewing about him in the ads I got were egregious. Hopefully when the Dems continue with this trash governance unfortunately for the next 2 decades, Washingtonians will finally pull their heads out of the sewer since we're (the dems) basically allowing the sewer to be in the streets and public spaces."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Im from the Netherlands and this feels like a win for me!! Proud of America 🇺🇸 ❤
5yzkXzPBf7Y,I wonder how many of those disenfranchised Democratic voters whose votes were trashed by those elites voted for Trump?
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"I feel unburdened by what has been. Things wont be easy , but will be better."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Today we're all Orange 😆
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"The manner in which Michael Knowles smokes a cigar is both smug and endearing. Oddly though, the gesture is not necessarily endearing BECAUSE of it's accompanying smugness. Our analytical task deepens somewhat when I concede a 'medium confidence' level in my characterization of Knowles's smug cigar-wielding as such and YET, it remains endearing nevertheless. In any case, when my grandkids ask me about Election Night '24 years from now, that's where the story begins and ends as far as I'm concerned. 

Congrats to all at the DW and this side of the aisle on a job well-done, from an erstwhile Lefty refugee, ever-grateful for the jailbreak→asylum y'all granted me when there was nowhere else to turn. May we all come together now to salvage what we can from these many piles of rubble to honor our complicated past and tenuous present to deliver a well-earned future."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"My cousin’s son is in the navy and he said that when Trump won, the place erupted in cheers."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,He won the election but he isn't' president yet!  Ratskin already said he wasn't certifying the election if Trump won.  3 months of Dems finding some way to avoid him going to the White House.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Thank you for helping Trump’s reelection.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,When did youtube start flagging Ben's videos with notice of product placement ad.
5yzkXzPBf7Y,We fought and WON!!!!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"So happy for America, love from UK."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Congratulations from Ireland! 
I was really worried about you guys for a while there."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"The left, having a hissy fit, needs a time out."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"As a first-time voting Republican, this was a night to remember. Contributing to such a historic and consequential election victory means a lot to me. We can now make America great again and advance toward a future of progress and unity. Shoutout to @Election_Time for their coverage throughout this whole election and astounding predictions."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Please tell Donald Trump to get some rest! He has gone through so much in the past 8 years that he needs some peaceful sleep! Please God give Trump some peace now!
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Wow I guess the CIA, FBI, and NSA and the world's global ""elite"" let Trump become president again. Gee.  They ain't so tough after all I guess. Get ready for lots and lots of useless rallies. Um, this all happened before? Americans gave Trump and Republicans the bulk of federal and state governments? The trajectory over the cliff won't change an inch."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Happy Ben is terrifying😂
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"God does not abandon his children. Thanks for the reminder, sir."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Just to think that were it not for the criminal DS, this election would have been a ‘walk in the park.’"
5yzkXzPBf7Y,"Finally you have done it Ben! More than an year of preparation, propaganda effort to finally achieve this Win.."
5yzkXzPBf7Y,Lol
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Feel vindicated Viva Frei. All these Aholes who came after Trump have been taught a hard lesson on the consequences of overreach. As some of them may have learned, but sadly most of them won't,  overreach can have catastrophic results."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Viva knows specifics about firing squads. Note to self: Don't piss him off 😅
qzcqbIDIkuk,"I hate the whole ""chicken hawk"" meme... but for the left to call this a threat is either idiocy or gross dishonesty."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Is that the battalion with Arion supremacist?

I don't respect kiton off the screen."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Unfortunately, many on the Left suffer from willful ignorance. They refuse to consider any positions that challenge their ignorance and become increasingly unhinged as their ignorance is challenged."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Well the unconstitutional Jan 6th committee which destroyed the evidence they claimed supported their verdict was arguably treasonous but he didn't say she should be executed.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Right again!
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Its MADDENING watching liberals in real time say the shit they say and think how they think. It boils down to their core that they're just insane, period."
qzcqbIDIkuk,The Azov Battalion is the Nazi arm of the Ukrainian Army that Putin ostensibly staged the invasion to eliminate.
qzcqbIDIkuk,They know exactly what he meant…
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Mark Cuban should know we are loud, proud, strong, intelligent women who support DJT! Cuban isn’t the intelligent person he thinks he is!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,Why can’t we charge the media with a felony for lying?! Their lies are being used to throw the election towards the chameleon!
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Who is running the DNC and the media, Jussie Smollett?"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Hoping Viva would have a little true intellectual curiosity, reach out and verify if I have this info. He doesn't want to do a little checking and locate my e-mail and let me send him the files which he could run through his virus program  and see what he's been griping about not being available when he doesn't want to see, he doesn't want to acknowledge that some of his biggest heroes are on those files, he doesn't want the suffering of the children to darken his little Disney world. You are a lawyer, a simple e-mail inquiry is too much? For the biggest info that could make a huge difference and people would see why those people are supporing the deep state. Hopes dashed I guess. I don't post the links because I get kicked out of comment section when I try to do that. I have an X account but it's all I can do to log in and read a few posts, and I don't have a check mark. I haven't been able to attach media. Not saying I can't, just saying I haven't figured it out yet.  I follow you over there, as well, Viva, same pic as this. I was hoping you of all people would actually care."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"😂 Wow, Michael Keaton looks like Joe Biden these days!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,Maybe if these media companies were sued every time they lied….they might stop….or pay massive fines…JUST STOP LYING
qzcqbIDIkuk,"An aspect of the ""5th Ave"" comment that the left doesn't get or won't admit.  Most Americans associate 5th ave. with the rich  i.e. millionaires row, high end shops etc."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Insane!!
qzcqbIDIkuk,Well said Viva  yes they want America to be like Europe. Keep speaking the truth !!!
qzcqbIDIkuk,"""We are checking to see if it crossed that line."" 6:05

Uh, no. At best, you would be checking whether you want to try to *argue* that it crossed that line because you want to roll the dice on getting enough of a politically corrupted judge that he'd countenance your selective prosecution at the local courthouse."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"I already said I  support him, you don't have to keep trying to convince me."
qzcqbIDIkuk,I think the Democrats are too unintelligent to understand what people say.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Ruby red Wyoming threw Cheney out on her ear.  We did this because we don’t like turncoats.  What does she do then she goes to Kamala!  She is a dangerous snake who cannot be trusted and is totally in favor of war.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"No he didn’t! He said she would be so WAR HUNGRY, IF SHE HAD TO GO TO THE FRONT LINES!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,I am GenX and a former Marine and former Guardsman. No Democrat can hurt my feelings by throwing gender insults. 😂
qzcqbIDIkuk,Sell Arizona to Mexico?? I don't want them to ruin another four years. Lyin' Saks!
qzcqbIDIkuk,This is so ridiculous I swear both sides are playing us it's like the stupidity is so obvious
qzcqbIDIkuk,"The point is:  she would change her mind about war if she was on front the  lines with multiple firearms pointing/firing at her!    

They all talk shit about going to war when they themselves will never be shot at!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"LoL.   Deep state and liberals will say and do anything ..

If trump wins  be prepared for  chaos!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"There's a storm coming. I can feel it in the air, and it's going to get nasty when Trump wins. The left will lose their minds."
qzcqbIDIkuk,The only firing squad where the “victim” has a rifle.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trump is coming to my small town in Va today. The amount of people showing up is shutting the whole town down. I've never seen anything like it. MAGA
qzcqbIDIkuk,Journalism schools training future professional liars.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Do you know if it’s true Beyoncé and Lizzo got paid millions of dollars to say they support Harris? I heard on TV but I can’t remember who it was that mentioned it.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Nobody believes it, yet people spread it around. Let the msm croak already"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"They count on people being too lazy to look for the source, and unfortunately that's a good bet. 

Dick Cheney was called a chicken hawk all the time for the Iraq & Afghanistan wars. He & Liz understood what was being said but power means more than truth for them."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Great idea even if untrue.
qzcqbIDIkuk,MSM is stuffed  full with escaped  insane asylum lunatics
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Ugh, this was in October? Just because you posted it in nov, doesn’t make it a November surprise?"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"The core Democrat voters simply believe anything they are told regardless of what they’ve observed in their own lives. The stupidity of the stuff that they believe boggles the mind. These are people who are convinced that the Dobbs decision made treating miscarriages illegal in every state in the union, even states where abortion remains legal. We are dealing with people who can’t understand that a “heartbeat bill” does not apply to a dead baby."
qzcqbIDIkuk,They're not nuts. They're desperate and the ends justify the means...
qzcqbIDIkuk,😊👌
qzcqbIDIkuk,"The Democratic Party are cheating the vote. They are using fake identification that passes through And paying people off to do the vote and the cheating for them These people normally pass through different places If you look at the security camera you will see them They like to come when there's nobody around or when there's a lot of people around They come in a group And they tried to pay off other people off in the street. The Democratic Kamala Harris Are not doing everything fairly. They dirty scam is being told early to be aware of these people They use fake Social Security name. And fake I D. They are cheated the college vote already. And now they are cheating all the popular votes. They tried to make it look like a tight race that That is the conspiracy that's going on. These corrupted people should be ashamed of their self. They are also using immigrants for Out of state to vote. That is not fair for what they doing Kamala Harris should be disqualified for what's going on They are going to put a little show at the end of the vote. Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and all these Spanish stars. Everything is being told already and recorded So you heard it from me. Get ready for the war."
qzcqbIDIkuk,What did you expect from evil lying abusive bully narcissist demons?
qzcqbIDIkuk,Typical democrats - they can't even organise an October surprise in October. EDIT: Disappointed in Michael Keaton: I didn't expect that from him.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trump is always around strong and intelligent women 💯
qzcqbIDIkuk,"I have a High School education, and I understood immediately what President Trump said, and meant. The media knew it also, but their agenda requires lies, rather than the truth."
qzcqbIDIkuk,His Beatlejuice movie really sucked.
qzcqbIDIkuk,I vote for the sqaud . She's is a traitor to America
qzcqbIDIkuk,I don't care if he did threaten Liz Cheney. The thought of Cheney in front of a firing squad  wouldn't cost me a moment of sleep.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Last I heard they don’t give you a gun when you’re facing a firing squad 😂😂😂😂
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Such blatant lies SHOULD cost them BUT the Left  are SO brain washed and/or braindead , they'll choose to pretend it's true ."
qzcqbIDIkuk,DA who pursues this stupid charge should be disbarred.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Wrap up smear
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Malcom X said it best never trust a liberal especially a white liberal..

Trump and Vance America 🇺🇸 first."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Honestly, i listened to the clip you just played and also thought he meant firing squad... Before i realised he was refering to sending her off to war.
I can legitimately see why some people think hes refering go firing squad tho."
qzcqbIDIkuk,How do you recognize  people who lie and look at their anger and threats.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Well thank God I didn’t spend money on the movie beetle juice , now that I know where he stands , don’t worry Michael the real men never wanted Trump to “HANG OUT” with them and aren’t worried if Elon or Trump aren’t thier BRO’S” , real men have an indentity and don’t need confirmation from anyone else ."
qzcqbIDIkuk,He never said anything about a firing squad.
qzcqbIDIkuk,😂
qzcqbIDIkuk,Liz is Miss Piggy IRL.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Democrats are traitors, act accordingly"
qzcqbIDIkuk,Arizona has to attend to the unregistered voters it has been ordered to account for. EXPECT DEFLECTION ( of which this Cheney thing is )
qzcqbIDIkuk,❤❤❤VOTE TRUMP TO SAVE OUR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
qzcqbIDIkuk,The truth has never gotten in the way of a good narrative
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trump is going to blow it.
qzcqbIDIkuk,It’s crazy how the Dems have become the war wh0res
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Media is corrupt as sh!t, should all lose their licenses for broadcasting."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Yes, the Media is using sensationalism to get views.
Everyone does it.  Including you."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trump broke their brains.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"He points out that the war mongers are not the one to pay the ultimate price of their decisions. If they were in the situation they sent thousands of people into, they would not be so pro war."
qzcqbIDIkuk,correct
qzcqbIDIkuk,Can these people just once speak the truth....? Guess not
qzcqbIDIkuk,Good to know that with so many real criminals wreaking havoc on Arizona's border region that the AG will be putting this as a priority for law enforcement action. Disgusting.
qzcqbIDIkuk,I prefer what the rock group Black Sabbath called them...War Pigs.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"These people are so weak and stupid (MSNBC etc.).  I'm so done with them!  As the election fast approaches, their desperation is so palpable, it's ready to explode! 💣💣💥💥🙉"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Bullies,  Liars and Thievs."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Start suing them for billions.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Great Show👍🏻
qzcqbIDIkuk,Just like Liz the RINO LIED and hide the True facts about J6 and because You LIZ they still in jail with bail. Just like a Marxist it’s ok if you do it!
qzcqbIDIkuk,Mark Cuban is a moron. It’s a mystery how he’s rich. Realty is he’s probably not stupid he’s just evil
qzcqbIDIkuk,I'm so sick of these ridiculous liars.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Fake Media the LIAR Kamala and the Marxist Democrats Fake Media, now you have Marxist AG I Arizona and Kamala want Trump Disqualified and Jailed! Here we go again 5 days out!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,I thought he said war hawk
qzcqbIDIkuk,The 9 rifles are reference to the FBI swating 70 year olds at 0dark30
qzcqbIDIkuk,I want to see Liz put on trial and sentenced to prison for her J6 fake committee.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Every one should send them fortunate son. So they know we know.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"The second I watched Trump say that, I facepalmed. No he didn't threaten anybody, but he sure was an idiot for saying it."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"They know they are lying,but they also know the left will believe whatever they say.The level of gaslighting from the left is insane. The indoctrinated mind doesn't have the capability to use common sense. The msm is lying & brainwashing these people. But again ...... They will never believe they are being lied to & brainwashed,  because they are  being lied to & brainwashed. 🤷"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"I was born in a different country.. a tyranical country and lived half of my life there, and half of my life in the States. This is my country. You are 100% right.. this is an election that is LITERALLY crossroads between authoritarian tyranny or free country. No hyperbole. These people are pure evil. They will destroy everything and everyone who stands in their way if Trump loses."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trump 2024!
qzcqbIDIkuk,These last days are aging me were going to save this country
qzcqbIDIkuk,erggh the softcock-ery of these nuts
qzcqbIDIkuk,Intimidating someone hell! They are literally trying to UN alive Trump.
qzcqbIDIkuk,He told her that she should go to the front lines of the war she wants to start. I think all politicians should have to work in the military if they are going to put us in more.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Trump even said “put her with a rifle standing there” implying she should be on the battlefield, NOT in front of a firing squad. I agree, if she wants war then she should be forced to fight in war."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Go back in your cave Keaton
qzcqbIDIkuk,bunch of fools
qzcqbIDIkuk,They're Desperation is Showing and it’s  PRICELESS!
qzcqbIDIkuk,"And that guy thinks kamala cares about him. Hey, maybe she does🤔"
qzcqbIDIkuk,Thank you Viva
qzcqbIDIkuk,They are all a bunch of lunatics.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Things were good when this petty tyrant was in office last last time.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"I think Trump makes these comments knowing full well that the media will run with it and make a total ass of themselves, lol"
qzcqbIDIkuk,Excellent video. Thank you for exposing the lies and speaking the truth!
qzcqbIDIkuk,"At 9 minutes Viva, you just described what toxic narcissists do to their ""supply"".
Yep, UT is ""sensor""ing a lot people."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Its to be expected that the msm would twist anything he says. Maybe a lowkey approch should be taken for the rest of the election. We're so close
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Had he simply said ""Let's send her to the front lines with our brave mean and women of the military"" there would have been zilch they could twist."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Its incredible he cant sue anyone. Its actual malice.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Bruce Wine, had too much 😂"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Looks like keaton is a demon too.
Personal opinion."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"One vote is cast from all of us. Please check the box for Trump - Vance on November 5th, 2024!! ❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸  Thank you, Viva!!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"I love ya Viva but not once did I see ""Firing Squad"" in either of their Tweets. Just playing Devils advocate here."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"You can tell they are lying when you see their lips move, pay attention!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Fake,  desperate media"
qzcqbIDIkuk,Whether Trump wins or not we are screwed as a nation. Almost have our population is either  stupid or evil.....maybe both. We are doomed.....RUN TO THE LORD!!!
qzcqbIDIkuk,Another stinking pile of lying liberal leftist horseshit…
qzcqbIDIkuk,"I voted early today in Pinal county AZ. Trump, Lake and not 1 single demonrat. Pure blood, deplorable, ultra dark MAGA, garbage, independent woman."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Even if he did....
qzcqbIDIkuk,Another stupid Hollywood elites. Keep your  opinions to yourself.
qzcqbIDIkuk,he said war hawk
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Kris Mayes is a Sack of Schiff, coming from an Arizona resident."
qzcqbIDIkuk,It really helps to see Trump's comment in context.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"There should never be a single municipality in the us where there can EVER be a ""zero tolerance policy' for protests. The point of 1a is that the govt MUST tolerate protest, at all times."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Thanks viva❤
qzcqbIDIkuk,"It was pretty clear what he was saying.  If you want to send our children to war, you should be there with them.  Then we will see if Liz thinks it was worth it. It's also clear that no one in the Democrat party can or should be paid attention to. Because they obviously don't live in reality and can't comprehend simple fact or are just lying. 
Looking at you, Micheal."
qzcqbIDIkuk,She’s a chicken hawk.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trying to gaslight us? We heard what we heard!
qzcqbIDIkuk,Viva you're a Canadian treasure thank you....go  Leafs go
qzcqbIDIkuk,Hope Joe remarks on Trumps Liz Cheney thing.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Liz is a proven liar so there’s that. Never trust a liar she was proven to lie to the congressional committee looking into the Russia gate affair, causing fellow Americans to languish in prison for 4 years."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"He didnt threaten her, he made a statement.
I second trumps statement!!!!"
qzcqbIDIkuk,Didn't Joe Bye-Done say to put a bullseye on Trump. And everyone including Democrats heard him say it. Some even tried.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"They're gonna treat this like every other lie.  Keep lying and hope people don't look it up themselves, if Google lets them find it."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Was Keaton  at  Diddy party 😂🤣
qzcqbIDIkuk,"But seriously folks. When somebody talks about ""crosshairs"" or ""a rifle,"" in connection with a political person or issue, it is a metaphor."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"if that was a death threat, there thousands against trump."
qzcqbIDIkuk,They stop at nothing…
qzcqbIDIkuk,"We are laughing at you Michael Keaton, big fool !"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Why can't they just tell us about how their ideas are better? If Tim and Karmela have better plans, tell us why they are better for us?"
qzcqbIDIkuk,dems are funny
qzcqbIDIkuk,they know exactly what trump meant. theyre diggin woodchips from the bottom of the barrel.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Just because Liz deserves a squad... 
doesn't mean President Trump threatened it with one."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trump needs to put that clip in an ad TODAY!
qzcqbIDIkuk,LIZZY is such a DRAMA QUEEN!!!!!
qzcqbIDIkuk,"6:29 Police have no tolerance for protests? Yest when Trump said the National Guard could deal with any terrorist plots or riots on election week, the left screamed claiming he wanted to ""send the military after US citizens"", he wouldn't even be president until January."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Vote for Trump. Many Democrats are fascist racists sexist liars. Cheney is an evil person. Donald Trump is around intelligent women. If the women are stupid, asinine and willing to murder children yet to be born, then, of course, he would not want to be around the idiotic haters and baby-killers.  Harris is not a strong woman, but a weak-minded and evil woman.  Do not be an asshole and throw your vote to the Satanist."
qzcqbIDIkuk,i hear you and support
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Trump's 2016 shooting comment was political hyperbole but Democrats and lame brained, lame stream media pundits are too stupid to realize that.  Same here."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Like the ""Dictator for a day"" comment, it should be criminal election interference how they lie. 
For being such a horrible person, it is funny that every terrible thing they try to spread is a lie.
They can't find 1 thing he has actually done or said that would fit the narrative they are pushing."
qzcqbIDIkuk,it is like their brain just translates things opposite reality do they not see the flood of migrants from everywhere...who cares what these celebrities think.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"A comedian has FANS, a candidate has SUPPORTERS.  Its hilarious how they combed thru a 3 hour talk to chop, dice and edit it to 11 seconds. 3 more seconds and the truth is revealed. I hope the Arizona AG does investigate so he can eat crow and wear egg on his face."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"The only reason they can do this is because there are people out there that want to believe their lies, other wise they would have no audience to preach to. TDS. Funny Lizzo petty, vindictive, unstable are the words I would use to describe you. I think the voters let you know how credible you are."
qzcqbIDIkuk,I saw joy reid was leading her show with this.   So it was clear it was complete bs.   Why was I on MSNBC.   Because you have to see what the enemy is doing
qzcqbIDIkuk,"When I see Celebrities endorsing kamala.
Tell me you went to diddy parties, without telling me you went to diddy parties.."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Unsubscribing.. because of your clickbait ""FIRING SQUAD""  headline... It was totally unnecessary and inflammatory at this late stage in the election. Very disappointed."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"The Arizona AG is a disgrace to all livingkind.

I simply cannot fathom how such a person could look at themselves in a mirror, ever. Even once."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Dem AGs have to try and show America how much they hate free speech right before the election.

qzcqbIDIkuk,"Unfortunately, not all of us were financially literate early. I was 35 when I finally educated myself and started taking steps. I went from $176,000 in debt with zero savings or retirement to now, 2 years later, fully debt-free and over $1,000,000 net worth. I know that doesn't SOUND like a lot, but I'm incredibly proud of it. Now l'm fast-tracking my wealth building (investing $400,000 annually) and don't owe a dime to anyone. It's a good feeling.,,"

qzcqbIDIkuk,Watching from Alberta Canada
qzcqbIDIkuk,OMG! Wow!
qzcqbIDIkuk,Interesting times indeed 🤔
qzcqbIDIkuk,"The only way you can take what Trump said as a threat is if you intentionally wanted to hear a threat.  I heard his comment and I perfectly understood it to be that she is certainly willing to send YOUR husbands, wives, sons, and daughters to war without trying to find a solution to an international issue, but not HER or HER family.  Also, I will put my intellect and drive up against the man who defamed both; I am confident who would come out ahead."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Re: Michael Keaton. 
Man! I really hate it when grown men behave like junior high school mean girls."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Michael Keaton turns out to be an asshole. Man as a movie fan it’s getting really hard to keep losing my favorite actors to the scum of the earth commie  Democrats. First Robert De Niro now this clueless actor.
qzcqbIDIkuk,What Trump actually said isn't a new thought. It's obvious that he was suggesting (facetiously) that she should go to a conflict zone and get a taste of some front-line combat. People in the military have had that notion towards politicians and elites forever.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"i wonder if the Arizona AG has a room full of weighted Coercement  out of camera shot , ""He looks real uneasy"""
qzcqbIDIkuk,Arizona law. Is that an oxymoron?
qzcqbIDIkuk,"It sounded more like he was saying they wouldn't be so warhawkish if they were forced to actually fight on the front lines of the wars they push for.
This is a common anti-war sentiment."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Love your show. Love the intellectual exchange
qzcqbIDIkuk,Liz and her pearl-clutching besties on the left - LOL. Just Ell. Oh. Ell.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Trump trolled TF out of Kamala and the media.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Sooo Many aging actors trying to sound relevant again. I used to like Movies, but the Oscars Ruined that for me. Ricky Gervais, Mel Gibson, George Carlin & many more ALL had it figured out ..! It's just a Matter of time and they'll all be on the Bread Line sucking the Hind TIT of REALISM ! They all make me PUKE 🤢"
qzcqbIDIkuk,"They are going to do anything and everything to win.  Cheat, AI/altered clips, illegal votes, trying to disqualify Trump if he wins, sentencing Trump to jail on those bogus convictions. It’s going to get nasty no matter what"
qzcqbIDIkuk,ID RATHER BE DISRESPECTED BY TRUMP THANK YOU VOTE FOR HARRIS AND THEIR SOCIALIST DEI GAY ILLEGAL AGENDA
qzcqbIDIkuk,"It’s all too nuts but damn, I really wish Trump would stop giving them these little tidbits which are then twisted and used against him. Just please, choose your words a bit more carefully."
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Not so strangely, I'm not adverse to the out of context version."
qzcqbIDIkuk,Media lies again. 😂😂😂
qzcqbIDIkuk,David what do know about strong intelligence women....... loved that ending ..  say hi to your wife..you know the  actual brain surgon..
qzcqbIDIkuk,So called celebrities and wokies are really physically odd looking. They don't look or act normal. Too many injections? Just saying 🤔
qzcqbIDIkuk,Good for you Viva!  I admire your courage.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"So, in modern US firing squads, they issue a certain number of blank rounds, and certain number of real rounds among the 5 shooters, so nobody knows who killed the convict."

qzcqbIDIkuk,Pretty good idea however...
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Gonna put it out there one more time. I have the unredacted client list and flight manifest for a certain plane. I got it from a trial deposition of one of Eps victims. These are federal records accepted into court as evidence. I have offered to give anyone who wants a copy a copy. I am not asking for money. I just want people to stop acting like the info isn't really out there and readily available and then gripe because the feds won't release it. I'm sick to death of the NON ACTION of every influencer or clergyman or law enforcement person I reach out to. I've come to the conclusion no one REALLY cares about the kids or they'd be beating down my door for this info. I don't even need my name or anything associated with it, I don't want that, I want someone to give damn and show it by doing a little follow through instead of a lot of whining. I've been trying for 6 years now. I'm tired and I'm dying, and I want someone to freaking pay attention to what is happening to the children."
qzcqbIDIkuk,They have nothing left. So much BS.
qzcqbIDIkuk,Saying that the media lied is like saying that water is wet.
qzcqbIDIkuk,"Makes me want to get my money back for beetljuice... ugh... LITERALLY everything keaton says about Trump and Musk are ACTUALLY true of kameltoe and the dum-o-RATS. Why can't these loser celebs keep their lies and  ignorance to themselves, and just entertain us? 😡😡😡"

qzcqbIDIkuk,"Uhhh... I think you may need to make a correction to that tweet. He called her a War *Hawk,* which is a wildly different ""wh"" sounding word than the one you attributed to him. 😂"

PNGJhj7I6FA,Leago
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Maybe Harris was going for the ""I have a dream"" angle in this debate, but the first thing that came to my mind was a debate between John Kerry and George W. Bush in 2004 before the election that year. I wasn't old enough to vote back then, but one of my classes assigned homework for watching a debate and writing a bit about it. I'm certain that most details have long since faded from my memory about the debate I watched, but the thing that never faded was hearing Kerry repeatedly say, ""I have a plan."" Just like Harris, he would follow it with different goals every time he said it, but even little teenager me noticed that he never explained how he intended to accomplish any of those goals. It made him sound like he didn't actually have any plans."
PNGJhj7I6FA,Digger #44 here…I didn’t sound totally retarded lol 1:42:17
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Good show, Joe."
PNGJhj7I6FA,Moderators fair?? That’s insane. They bashed Trump and did not let him speak and make his points.
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Pet eating thing has gone mega viral all round the world.  The debate is about whether or not they ate pets.  It's accepted by both sides without question that Haitian illegal immigrants are all of this town.  So in a way, mentioning this is genius from Trump. 

Fact check: ""there are 20,000 illegal immigrants in that town but they probably didn't eat pets"" is not winning Kamala any extra votes. It may win Trump some"
PNGJhj7I6FA,Camp David regularly hosted terrorists during the Clinton administration.
PNGJhj7I6FA,"joe is 110% wrong with the debate moderators being ""fair"""
PNGJhj7I6FA,Trump just lost the election
PNGJhj7I6FA,The moderators *seemed* fair but you can tell they were in the tank for Harris throughout it and not just the abortion topic. They answered a few questions for her lol
PNGJhj7I6FA,Why does everyone miss the fact ABC only had the do you accept you loss question as a way for him to lose the Georgia case by admitting he knew he lost and still went through with the alternative electors. The moderators were fair did you watch the debate? They constantly protected her and changed the subject to save her and attacked Trump!
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Honestly i was expecting a pretty even match because the policy is in his favor but the setting was in hers. I had hoped to see him mop the floor with the Indian fishwife and was dissapointed he didnt. But on the rewatch I honestly think he won almost every exchange and despite the questions being stacked against him, he just used them as a chance to address the bullshit. Overall strong debate. And I think it was a win for both, she proved she could hold her ground and gave her supporters and TDSers something to cling to. And he showed relative composure, he showed an actual platform and he used being put on the spot as a chance to explain himself. As a competition I think he won but as far as advancing their goals both canidates came away winners. I want two more. If he gives her another debate under her conditions he can use that to press her into a debate under his and if she refuses it will look bad on her."
PNGJhj7I6FA,They both pass. No one win they tied. Trump had to  a blowout the park to win. She just needed to show up.
PNGJhj7I6FA,Trump needed to win this since he tied the tide goes to Carmel
PNGJhj7I6FA,Kamala reminded me of Amber Heard last night.
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Trump could have done things better and Kamala performed better than expected, but looking at facts and policy, nothing has changed. The current administration and their direction is undeniably driving things down a deep chasm, that cannot continue. Trump offers an alternative that also has a history of working.

Regardless, please get out and vote. Support your local efforts, keep an eye out for shenanigans."
PNGJhj7I6FA,call in the first half of the 4th hour should probably be edited to redact that number
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Janellerella Pets might have been huge on X, but it is a peripheral topic, especially in Springfield, OH. which is about as far from the Southern Border that you can get, it was as pointless as saying Haitians might steal your chickens for Santería, and FYI my father was born in a camp/ village thrown up to house refugees from the devastated areas of Belgium during and after WW1, and cats regularly went ""missing"" where ever people are marginalised there will be stories about people eating pets, no doubt people still say the same about Koreans eating dogs, It doesn't mean it needs to be part of an election dialogue - IMO it was the only time Trump looked weak."
PNGJhj7I6FA,I feel like trump probably lost the election tonight.
PNGJhj7I6FA,It's the ECONOMY STUPID
PNGJhj7I6FA,You’re right about the closing.  Should have been one or 2 lines about her; the rest about the good he would do. A wasted opportunity. 😟
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Also, i thought no notes were permitted?"
PNGJhj7I6FA,I do think he took the bait too often. Being on the defensive caused him to miss so many opportunities to call her out. Her comment about “territorial sovereignty” was a stunner.  What about our territorial sovereignty?
PNGJhj7I6FA,3:18:41  He missed his chance to say MAHA and discuss that.
PNGJhj7I6FA,It seems linking to the cat eating mini documentary video is being restricted.
PNGJhj7I6FA,"They only "" fact check "" trump"
PNGJhj7I6FA,Her face expressions were annoying
PNGJhj7I6FA,She was wearing an earpiece. You can see she was being fed lines multiple times. She has awkward pauses throughout her answers. The slueths on X already found the type of piece she was wearing
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Definitely biased moderators, and the questions and answers were scripted for Kamala to make her look better.."
PNGJhj7I6FA,Thanks Joe❤
PNGJhj7I6FA,Joe calling the debate fair lol what are you watching?
PNGJhj7I6FA,"On the Ohio cat eating thing, I think it was a decent move to bring it up because it takes the problem of the open border invasion and makes it personal and tangible. It's hard to understand the ramifications of something as gargantuan as invasion, so you break it down to a personal and relatable level to drive the point home. 

Democrats are very good at this, they avoid talking about abstract ideas in favor of anecdotes and stories to draw their base into narratives for the sake of engagement.

Toxoplasmosis is also quite real, rats infected with it will become attracted to cats, leading to cats eating them and becoming hosts. ""Cat people"" are at high risk of infection."
PNGJhj7I6FA,"lol first question: (to kamala) ""... you and president trump were elected four years ago...""
did joe biden write the questions?"
PNGJhj7I6FA,"I will say he really dropped the ball on the reply to the bill. He should have spoken up about what was within the bill, then the pet's being eaten story. The problem I have with the pet story is that I don't know much about it, and chances are the news isn't going to cover it if true and hide it. It's just not a great look."
PNGJhj7I6FA,"By the way, Kamala wears a wig too..."
PNGJhj7I6FA,I think having no audience was a disadvantage for Trump. He def feeds off that live audience energy
PNGJhj7I6FA,It's enjoyable to watch her get under your skin. Your tears are delicious.
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Sorry, I passed on this one dear leader. This is a pain to watch. I pray for your country that Trump wins.
This just a copy paste of my comment over at Megyn Kelly’s show. This is not healthy (for me) to be watching again. 
Republicans never learn. When people say that Democrats don’t know what they’re doing, I’m like, “Then how come they keep on winning come election time?” 
Republicans remind me of teachers, who think they are too smart, who would babble on and on and on. But the students never comprehended a single word he said. 
Sometimes you have to come down your high horse and “talk” to the people. In layman’s term if you may. Heck! If you gotta do street talk, as long as you can communicate with them. 
Republicans should not be complacent that people will vote the right way, just because it’s moral and right. I’ve seen this in my own country. Do not forget that your country have plenty of immigrants from 3rd world countries. Wherein underdogs are being upheld. Where they grew up with the narrative of poor and underdogs are good and rich people are bad. Where votes can be bought. Where they will vote for someone who can give them money, position, or power."
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Sorry I'm late... very much what I expected, I know some think Trump under performed, but he was clearly letting them hit him & time will show it worked. It's a subtle concept… But in the process of attacking your already thoroughly demonized foe, you always risk re-humanizing them & That's what ABC just did, 7 weeks..."
PNGJhj7I6FA,She couldn't say she's not the one sign bills due to she was the tie breaking in the votes that got the bills enabled to be signed. It's her policies because she was the tie breaker.
PNGJhj7I6FA,Shocked you think these moderators were fair
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Harris talk in circles, she's a master at that avoiding questions but talking nonsense  then we must be do work and assurances but no way of doing so."
PNGJhj7I6FA,"Nobody actually wins a debate like this, there's just perception. People sometimes remember key moments, such as Dukakis' seemingly cold and analytical response on the question about if his wife was grãped and moidered. In hindsight people look back and tell pollsters such things helped them make up their minds."
PNGJhj7I6FA,They are not executing babies. Where do y’all come up with these lies?
PNGJhj7I6FA,"A lib friend of mine and I were talking about it, and we both agree that hes much better on offense. I think everyone looking at this objectively sees this about the same regardless of side."
PNGJhj7I6FA,Trump got cooked bro

EqcKs15txTg,The root of the drug problem is Americans themselves. They create the demand. No demand = no supply. The same goes for the sex trafficking and child trafficking industries. Americans create the demand. So ... Americans need to get their shit together and learn to deal with life without drugs and new prisons need to be built to lock up the hundreds of thousands of degenerates buying children for sex or labor. These horrible criminal enterprises do business to meet the huge demand of the American market. Kamala Harris has been in cahoots with the cartels for decades. She needs to be prosecuted. She has played a significant role in destroying California and the US (abscent Border Czar).

EqcKs15txTg,"CA is actually red. It’s blue only if they cheat. LA county voted R DA by 20 point. Who would vote for a D governor and then a R DA ????  CA was called 20 min after poll closed.  You take cheating away, it’s RED"
EqcKs15txTg,This is all quite frightening .
EqcKs15txTg,One party state = Illinois
EqcKs15txTg,It sounds to me like they are intentionally running people out of California for a land grab at bargain basement prices. Soros needs to be removed from all government decisions. Insanity
EqcKs15txTg,Fascinating and intelligent conversation on the various causes of California's terrible fall into a narco-feudal state.
EqcKs15txTg,"Well, while it is people who allow themselves to get buy for money and position, will be keep having this issues 😢"
EqcKs15txTg,"Important question, what needs to be done to de-program Marx indoctrination? How can this be cleansed/removed from the education system and the follow on ( government, establishment media, foreign actors) etc? I propose Neo MacArthyism but how would that look like? How would be be structured and implemented?"

EqcKs15txTg,"Thank you, Tucker- for making this channel, not being afraid to talk about the truth, and asking hard questions. You're a real one. 💯
I'm looking forward to seeing you back on Fox News!"
EqcKs15txTg,"California legislators like to crow about ""it's the 5th/6th largest economy in the world"". Sad, because during my lifetime it was consistently 3rd, and that's how far it's now sunk."
EqcKs15txTg,Thank you both
EqcKs15txTg,Very interesting
EqcKs15txTg,"Californians moving out of their own messes, are destroying Wyoming, Idaho, Austin Texas. Freaking Marxist R3trads. These States need to have CA-De-programming Centers where they learn about US constitution, Bill of rights, Federalist papers, Magna Carta, memorize the pledge of allegiance to the FLAG, kiss the 🇺🇸, all of these b4 before they’re given State residence. Enough already‼️"
EqcKs15txTg,I mean 2 things psychopaths love: money and see other people suffer
EqcKs15txTg,"Tucker - please do a video or even a short on these districts that have not called the house yet. Those races should have been called already. Everyone is so focused on the historic win, they forgot about the house.. Let's get some media pressure on those districts to call it. The longer those drag out, it leaves room for fraud."
EqcKs15txTg,Thank you tucker for standing on the right side of history. Just an average joe from across the pond who hopes the future is bright for his kids
EqcKs15txTg,1:29 “Illegal alien cops?!” 😮
EqcKs15txTg,Sounds like California has devolved into a third world country!!!!
EqcKs15txTg,"George Soros is known as having, as a teenager in Hungary, turned in his Jewish neighbors to the Germans for cash.  George Soros is Jewish himself.  Money, of course, motivates Soros but what isn't being talked about is the UN/WEF/World Bank Agenda.  Soros belongs to the upper echelon as Kissinger was, Brzezinski was, Rothschilds are, Rockefeller's are, and so forth.  The US was engineered into its predominant position in the world post WWII (along with the creation of the UN, the Aspen Institute and more).  The US's scheduled time in the sun has run out and now it is being intentionally collapsed along with all of the west.  Come on.  Both Soros and the Koch Brothers were on record as having opined that the transformation of the US was more effectively achieved from the bottom up (cities) and not top down (federal government).  The Getty family also belong to the upper reaches of the global cabal."
EqcKs15txTg,"Meg Witman is now the US ambasador to kenya, my God they are wrecking my country in every way they can. No public service works, poverty has gone up, corruption is up, we live in an authoritarian state where the president is above the constitution, all this facilitated by the USA and IMF policies, plus corrupt politician emboldened by the backing from said org. Lord have mercy on Kenya."
EqcKs15txTg,"It's clear that the global Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels who make multi-billions of dollars each year are working closely with the global banking cartel.  The banking cartel has always profited off human and drug trafficking, going back hundreds of years."
EqcKs15txTg,"The Neo-feudalism will be global and the ""serfs"" will be fed (insects) and housed (""smart"" pods).  California (and other states) are just steps towards the ultimate goal."
EqcKs15txTg,"Shouldn't the US administration sue the current Prime Minister of Poland ( Donald Tusk in Poland pursues German interests) for falsely accusing President Donald Trump of being a Russian agent? After all, these accusations, which are now rife on the Internet, have gone worldwide and could have influenced the 2020 elections in America. A rhetorical question."
EqcKs15txTg,How many of you would like to see Tucker troll the leftist in the White House press corps as Trump’s Press Secretary?
EqcKs15txTg,"George Soros always funded ""criminal justice reform"" because his angle (his globalist takeover angle) is to collapse cities through chaos and conflict.  Of course Kamala Harris is just one more Soros agent.  Thank god that she got kicked to the curb on Tuesday.  Maybe they'll find her a place at the UN or some nefarious NGO.  Tucker Carlson's interviews are so well chosen and interview so fantastic.  (EDIT:  Just to put a fine point on it, all this is part of Agenda30.  George Soros couldn't care less about race - his aim is to freaking collapse the west (specfically the US).  The goal is to pave the way for global corporate/oligarchic governance with large sections of collapsed societies begging for global governance.)"
EqcKs15txTg,"@Tucker Carlson, if you ever get attacked by a demon again, check with the FBI, CIA etc and figure out if it's an energy weapon. They're alk the rage these days. Some people call them Death Stars."
EqcKs15txTg,**I would love to see you interview Joel Salatin** 🫠
EqcKs15txTg,California turned into a Hell h*le 😢
EqcKs15txTg,This story is true. I lived in California for 25 years. I was a police impound dispatcher. My kids were half Hispanic. The MS 13 gang literally tried to steal my kids from me. They would hang out by the school and brainwash them to hate your parents and join their group. I  had to leave the state and not tell the kids until shortly before leaving.
EqcKs15txTg,"Psychopaths know theft of private property = reparations to the underclass. The hostile elite are not affected because they have private security.  Those doing research about crime tell us property crimes are ignored. Chris Moritz said they were not working on his case because of all the homeless deaths. The cycle of immorality can be entered at any point and each act leads into the next, serving the ends of the anti-humans."
EqcKs15txTg,Hey is there gonna be a tcn app. I would love to have an app version so I can listen to art of surge easier
EqcKs15txTg,Kamala Harris has ties to the cartel.
EqcKs15txTg,May I suggest the Benelli M4. An Italian classic.
EqcKs15txTg,"Tucker is a journalist lacking cultural depth, who fails to grasp the US's global significance."
EqcKs15txTg,"RJA. “WHITE GANG MEMBERS”
Whatever those are…
🤨 

Yes so these laws are really stupid and shortsighted.

The real answers to criminal justice reform are:
1) Make the prosecutors play by the rules !!!
Make them face consequences when they don’t go by the rules- like Kamala EVERY DAY!!!

2) Let the elected judges have some discretion (reevaluate mandatory sentencing).  And don’t let them own prisons.

3) Stop stacking the deck. Open the doors and expertise of the “government lab” utilizing blind submissions from the prosecution and the defense through the Court.  After all innocent until proven guilty… so the defendant is still part of “the people“ until/if he is found guilty."
EqcKs15txTg,"This is what the Left wants to do to the entire country. Once the entire country is as broken, corrupted and crime-ridden as California they will enact emergency powers, grab our guns, declare martial law, take away our freedoms and then establish a totalitarian regime that we will not be able to depose after having our guns forcibly taken and these Marxist Globalist Elites will rule us instead of representing us and the Great Experiment that is America will be over. Killed by the Leftist regime that so many ignorant, misinformed and often times stupid people follow blindly, believing the propaganda and lies. These people will be the last to see and understand what is happening to our great nation and who and what political party is behind it. It’s frightening that Democrat voters just don’t see that this is happening incrementally every time the Democrats are in power whether it’s at the county, municipal, state or Federal level so they continue to support the political party that plans to eventually enslave us all and bend us to their will."
EqcKs15txTg,"Wow. I suspected this. I live in California, this is what I see happening 😔😢"
EqcKs15txTg,Yo trump Won where is Tucker. Probably coked out somewhere having sex with a snow bunny baddies 😂😂
EqcKs15txTg,It’s amazing he has all of this information about how gangs and the war on drugs and Kamala writing laws that gives criminals a pass. Nothing about how the government/CIA experimenting on these exact same laws influences this behavior. LSD experiments in the 50s explain why the mindset of control and power is the world we live in.
EqcKs15txTg,They should keep 950$ as a misdemeanor & once you do it again make it a class 4 felony mandatory 6 months in jail
EqcKs15txTg,California will turn red.

EqcKs15txTg,"Soros is a British agent. the British elite do not care for their people, and even less for Americans."

EqcKs15txTg,The amount of commercials I’m getting the last 45 mins of this is crazy
EqcKs15txTg,*Can anyone reference where we can find Moritz’s book? I searched for it but couldn’t find anything? Is it not out yet? Thanks.*
EqcKs15txTg,"2:06:01 prosecutor from alameda county; “I blame the uneducated voter..”
2:11:45 “the banality of evil”
2:12:20 they’re all tied to gettys
2:19:55 prosecutors from alameda; jurors saying “I won’t convict a black person”.
2:20:01 Detroit never came back and neither did Rome.."
EqcKs15txTg,Wow
EqcKs15txTg,Tucker if you want a new age of dialogue and peaceful relations with Russia and the people of the Russian Federation I would suggest a meeting with Scott Ritter a former arms inspector I'm sure the walls of Russia phobia and fear isn't useful or productive in a world at war
EqcKs15txTg,…and seriously how many commercials can you have in one video????  HOLY CRAP it’s so annoying!!!
EqcKs15txTg,Soros - those who serve Satan is its own purpose and motivation.  Those who serve the Lord will never understand this.
EqcKs15txTg,"We're all CREATED  equal...we start out that way...but what happens after that is on us...if we choose to break the law, steal, kill, destroy, whatever laws we violate, we should be held into account and punished and the law should be applied equally regardless of skin color, sexual preference, etc..ino NO DEI in the criminal justice system. Lawlessness can destroy a nation."
EqcKs15txTg,"The coincidence of California miserable dirtiness,  abuse of drugs,  rampant criminality AND having the anti America politicians says it all."
EqcKs15txTg,I feel so sorry for the conservative people in California who have to live under this horrible system of government. Praying for you all!
EqcKs15txTg,"So..stupid laws were made....by stupid people apparently.  OR was this on purpose, meant to destroy CA."
EqcKs15txTg,"Insulation + Freedom + Technologies has segregated Americas community. This is why our country is what it is today. It allows for unknown and untrusted individuals like Harris to get into a place of power with anti-God anti-Christ and anti-America Ideologies. Our whole education system K-12 needs to be completely fortified and healed. 7th Graders with a High School diploma , if even that."
EqcKs15txTg,🤔👍👏
EqcKs15txTg,This video is being censored. Looked up Tucker Elon interview and only cnn came up lol
EqcKs15txTg,Thank you Tucker for supporting President Trump. You are amazing team!
EqcKs15txTg,"Kinda odd to talk about the ‘90s bloods and crips, and the current drug gangs south of the border without mentioning the CIA…"
EqcKs15txTg,"Kamala is absolutely the avatar of moral bankruptcy that represents the state of California! That’s an absolute fact, & she was absolutely going to do that to this country. 
So sitting in TN saying this, the day after we took back our country, THANK YOU GOD it didn’t go the other way 😭♥️"
EqcKs15txTg,As a life long resident of Los Angeles who has had family members nearly killed by these dynamics... this is exactly what has been going on over the last 3 decades in Los Angeles. Just moved my family out of California - so glad I got my family out of there.

EqcKs15txTg,"41:35   just a reminder...  This notion of prolonging suffering exists in almost every culture.   The Romans prolonged the suffering of Jesus...  Israelis are prolonging the suffering of Palestinians babies by burning them alive with white phosphorus....   So before we start picking apart native american tribes that lived thousands of years ago, take a look at what White European Jews are doing in the Holy Lands and Gaza....     Humans are absolute savages no matter where you go."
EqcKs15txTg,"It is only White people who, when they notice their own demographic replacement and genocide in play, say, ""that's not racist, that's just fact."""

EqcKs15txTg,"He is right about the burglary, it’s got you and you never feel safe again."
EqcKs15txTg,"1:29:49 … a mercenary army for the ruling class… right again, Tucker."
EqcKs15txTg,"1:27:46 This is a compelling interview. Bright man with researched facts to share and educate. My heart hurt hearing his account of the series of home invasions/robberies of his family home. But after all he’s experienced and learned first hand, my mind is blown that he has yet to become a practiced gun owner. Sir, what you’ve been through and see all around you is precisely why we have 2A. Go purchase a gun and get to the range!"
EqcKs15txTg,Well worth watching even after the election. Great guest Tucker!
EqcKs15txTg,"I don’t understand why ppl haven’t voted since they could….did you not care enough, just lazy, or ok with whatever status quo, I don’t get it.  I’d be embarrassed not proud to be an especially over 30yr old first time voter.  I’m glad you did, thank you, but please stay in the game in future elections since our vote is a right! You not voting before is probably why we got to this point."
EqcKs15txTg,"""I'm not gonna mention his name"" ....... proceeds to mention his whole career that is completely identifiable. He stating his title, how long he worked there, along with his new job."
EqcKs15txTg,"Kamala is with Cartels, that's why she wanted the borders open because she was getting money from the Cartels organization."
EqcKs15txTg,Every American needs to listen to this interview. This is incredible! 😳
EqcKs15txTg,In Sacramento California and voted for Trump the 3rd time.
EqcKs15txTg,"USA as a White Ethnostate would resolve these incompatibilities, and would be better for the world.  but waaaaaaysissss"
EqcKs15txTg,3 strikes passed in 1994....not 2011 dumbass
EqcKs15txTg,What’s the book?
EqcKs15txTg,"Tucker, I don’t recall ever hearing you say you were from San Diego.  I’m a San Diego native.  I am 60 years old.  I lived in San Diego county my whole life.  I moved to Arizona in 2020 because I couldn’t afford to live there any longer.  It wasn’t an easy decision.  I didn’t want to leave.  I truly miss it.  The weather in Arizona is not for me and has exasperated my health issues.  I really wish that California can be repaired.  I pray to God it can be repaired and cleaned up.  It’s so sad.  🇺🇸🙏🏻"
EqcKs15txTg,Has Moritz's book been published yet?  I can't find it anywhere...
EqcKs15txTg,Saul Alinsky’s playbook said you have to disrupt the ruling class. Follow him and you end up with Hillary and Obama
EqcKs15txTg,I'm not an American but even I can see what they have done in california was an experiment and the blueprint for what they were going to do to the rest of your country thankfully enough people saw sense and voted for Trump
EqcKs15txTg,Shame on those Radical Left Democrats!!!!
EqcKs15txTg,"Thank you so much Tucker Carlson, you helped save America 🇺🇸"
EqcKs15txTg,You think people are fleeing? Just wait. You couldn’t pay me enough to live under another Trump administration full of lies and fabrications. Shame on the whole despicable lot of you !!!!!
EqcKs15txTg,"This people who came from other countries would do everything to stay here. 
They lived  corruption in their countries throughout their entire life. So what we have here is heaven for them. They never experienced the real democracy. Therefore they would do whatever  to stay."
EqcKs15txTg,"Animism is simply the belief that everything has an energy flow or what some would call a ""spirit"". Yes it a part of some ancient belief systems but that doesnt make it witchcraft it's actual Physics and it's backed by 'String Theory' and Quantum Entanglement. Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean that it's innately evil!! I was with him until the spiritual psychosis took over. 😒"
EqcKs15txTg,"Just like Bongino, Tucker WAS a good citizen and warrior for righteousness until he became so full of himself that he started turning into an arrogant asshole....."
EqcKs15txTg,Tucker you are such a hypocrite. When you are on JOE ROGAN  you talk all for cannabis and then you turn around on your show and say it should be illegal ?? You truly are a hypocrite I will  unsubscribe good luck hypocrite Tucker
EqcKs15txTg,El Salvador is run by a Savior called Bukele.  There is no more cri.i la or very very little.
EqcKs15txTg,"1:42:00 say real estate. So Soros made sure property prices go down, his company and his friends' buy out all the property in SF because people are leaving due to higher crime rate, pay for the government to be tougher on crimes again, people come back, now they have to rent properties instead of owning them. ""You'll own nothing and be happy"" remember?"
EqcKs15txTg,Correction - Yes We Do Have Re Education camps .... University & Most Schools

EqcKs15txTg,"Diddy and Oprah are connected, along with Tom Hanks..."
EqcKs15txTg,So basically the plan was CA all America
EqcKs15txTg,"side note: Hey Oprah, lets talk about the picture with you and Tom Hanks (Tom with a black eye hold a sign saying ""I can't talk about it"") with the clock on the wall behind you both covered in hotdogs....   Let's talk about that moment and what is really going on....."
EqcKs15txTg,I don’t understand how people in CA can live this way. Year after year getting worse? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
EqcKs15txTg,😂not just California. Every state does it !
EqcKs15txTg,I love your interviews Tucker!
EqcKs15txTg,I'm so glad she wasn't able to sleep her way to the top. 🤮
EqcKs15txTg,You lose any credibility for being buddies with a human trafficking ped0 like Andrew Tate
EqcKs15txTg,"Tucker C .  Last 10 months My comments have answered… Trump 2 Term Presidential Chosen 🎚️

EqcKs15txTg,Tucker 💪💪💪WE WON !!!MACARENA 🙌🙌🙌
EqcKs15txTg,Doesn't Soros own progressive insurance?
EqcKs15txTg,"I am near tears tonight, to see Adam Schiff re-elected rather than Steve Garvey. Schiff is a well known stinker. It breaks my heart that California voters are so oblivious and easily manipulated. After election results tonight, I see I probably will have to leave my home state after all. There is so little hope, and I haven't much time left. 😢"
EqcKs15txTg,"SELLING US OUT ; IS WHAT SHES DOING !! WONT WORK,, THEY ONLY SHOW THEIR. CORRUPTION !!"
EqcKs15txTg,Open borders she gave the USA away.
EqcKs15txTg,"I did not sign my CA ballot envelope, but printed my name on the envelope, five days later LA County sent me an email stating that my ballot was counted. I expected an email saying my signature was bad and my ballot was not counted.... nope, CA said close enough! Signature matching on envelopes is a joke! As soon is the envelope is removed from the ballot the crime is done, and you can't prove fraud. So a political party that relies on cheating can say there is no evidence of fraud. However, Republican leaders should have been crowing about election integrity since 2020, where is the vocal opposition? Republican leaders should have explained to the American people that unrequested mail out ballots are made for fraud.  Republican leaders should say on every media appearance they are not election deniers, but they need to ask…prove to the nation that no illegal ballots are counted.... But it did not happen, so now we again still have cheating by bogus signature matching."
EqcKs15txTg,"Those who have some authority in our country, yet are Allowing the Destruction by criminals, like the shadow government & soros, are also criminals! Why hasn't Governor Abbott of Texas built a wall and done a better job to protect his and all American citizens?? There have been alot of talkers but few or no American heros standing up to protect our democracy,  except for Trump and his team! Let's pray they will clean the swamp & MAGA!"
EqcKs15txTg,.
EqcKs15txTg,Wow what a guest..this is unbelievable
EqcKs15txTg,it's the pelosi crime family. for decades they tax money launder and rig elections and install their dems buddy into top gov positions.
EqcKs15txTg,IF YOU REALLY HAVE BALLS GO SAY THAT INTO A SAMOAN MAN FACE TO FACE YOU ARE A COWARD
EqcKs15txTg,Trucker you know you are a coward.COWARD MAN LIKE YOU GOES ON TV THREATIN  WOMEANS LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE A MOM OR SISTER.THATS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SAY NONSENSE ABOUT OTHER COUNTRY LIKE SAMOAN .YOU CANT EVER STAND INFRONT OR A SAMOAN MAN AND SAY WHAT YOU SAID WE ARE NOT AN LOW IQ PEOPLE
EqcKs15txTg,Tucker for Trumps Cabinet!
EqcKs15txTg,"Well, why do any of us stay in California hoping for reform?  I don't think it is going to happen in my lifetime."
EqcKs15txTg,The situation in California is exactly what happened in Venezuela.....just a carbon copy...
EqcKs15txTg,"It should be enforced on all podcasters to interrupt their guests to take a sip of water when their mouths are obviously dry. It makes it unlistenable, listening to chops smacking and chalky tongue clicking. Extremely distracting and quite gross."
EqcKs15txTg,"I agree with Jimmy Dore that they are not going to let him win.
I love this gimmick of how Donald Trump is ""Fascist"" but they also wish him and his family well and hope he's okay every time there is an assassination attempt on him.
If you believe that Trump is Hitler why would you not rig the election, if you believe that Trump is Hitler why would you not try to take him out.
Yes... there is a strong possibility that the security state might do that just like they interfered in 1964 Coup in Brazil when US overthrew a Democratically elected government in Brazil.
The Impulse to interfere never changes.
The impulse to play GOD never changes.
If you think Donald Trump is Hitler, why would you not try lawfare against him? why would you not try to assassinate him? why would you not try to rig the election against Donald Trump to favour Kamala Harris? 
Why would you not censor the Hunter Biden laptop story?
It would not make any sense, if you don't.
Would you just sit aside and allow Hitler to win?
The impulse to interfere never changes and the impulse to play GOD never changes."
EqcKs15txTg,As far as I know Rome is still here
EqcKs15txTg,"I grew up between the bay area and Seattle. I can tell you that a rising majority of these liberal voters arent originally from the west coast. They pack their stuff and come out west to live some stupid hollywood liberal life style they feel they cant get in Virginia, Ohio, the east coast, whatever. They specifically come here to vote this way, unfortunately the beautiful west coast is now full of people who didnt move for work or opportunity, but identity politics. Most of us are not like this, we are not all like this. Im.not leaving though.  Im going to stay and fight to bring sanity back to the west coast of the USA."
EqcKs15txTg,Its funny they call gang members murderous criminals. They call ppl who steal through force kill thousands of ppl all over the world and kid nap people government.
EqcKs15txTg,We can't figure out what her name is! Lol
EqcKs15txTg,I've been watching this for an hour and a half and still idk who this guy is.

EqcKs15txTg,I dont feel srry for a cry baby rich kid. Honestly i would of handled it on the spot like a man. Jesus talk about cry baby left. This guh is worse.

sSP-2R5ikqM,Hey man as a guy who leans to the left I got to say credit where credit is due good prediction pretty accurate honestly even by the margins. You got Michigan wrong but it’s a tilt d when it’s a tilt r so almost got it completely right. I think what we’ve learned is polls are bs and republicans will always overperform as long as trumps on the ballot and democrats will overperform in midterms when he’s not if history holds. I’m interested to see if a 2028 candidate like Vance will overperform as well.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"HE DID BETTER THAN WHAT YOU PREDICTED AND WON MICHIGAN BY A TIGHT MARGIN!!
TOO BIG TO RIG BABY!!!!"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Our man won!
sSP-2R5ikqM,This was a good prediction but it underestimated Trump in numerous states.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Red Eagle - it looks like you predicted it perfectly. Nice Job.
sSP-2R5ikqM,off by only one state
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Solid prediction, but Michigan went to Trump too, so 312 points."
sSP-2R5ikqM,Dude you got it spot on (except michigan)! but 6 out of 7 is a great too!
sSP-2R5ikqM,Dude you were spot on !!! Thank you for keeping us motivated for voting for Trump. We saved our country and possibly the world. God bless you and your familly.  God bless America !!!
sSP-2R5ikqM,This aged like fine wine
sSP-2R5ikqM,"they are trying to steal the house....those totals should have been out by now, they're trying to steal it so they can keep hi from doing anything,."
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Congratulations, man. I kept a screenshot from when Harris got into the race, and you were spot on. I’m a subscriber for life🫡"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Pretty good! You only missed Michigan.
sSP-2R5ikqM,This aged like a fine wine
sSP-2R5ikqM,Aged nicely
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Dang you were CLOSE, almost a perfect map!"
sSP-2R5ikqM,You finally have more credibility than LTE. Good job
sSP-2R5ikqM,Talk about exceeding expectations!
sSP-2R5ikqM,Nice one!
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Wow, you only missed one"
sSP-2R5ikqM,"""New Jersey could be under ten"" proceeds to be 4 points."
sSP-2R5ikqM,He won Michigan!!!!!!
sSP-2R5ikqM,NAILED IT!
sSP-2R5ikqM,Congratulations and well done.  Enjoyed listening to your analysis during this longe campaign season.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Not bad! Only off by 1 state… Michigan.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Do you think the house is gonna win? @redeaglepolitics
sSP-2R5ikqM,U called it man looks like Michigan might go for Trump as well what a come back amazing
sSP-2R5ikqM,Impressive accuracy
sSP-2R5ikqM,Thanks for all the rock solid information!
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Aged very well.
Other than Maine, it was a bullseye."
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Pretty much spot on, and maybe you might’ve given her too much credit as Trump I’d probably gonna win Michigan.

Oh, LTE is rolling over crying 😂

Red eagle FTW"
sSP-2R5ikqM,How the hell does red eagle politics UNDERESTIMATE Donald Trump
sSP-2R5ikqM,You were by far the closest of any major election site on YouTube
sSP-2R5ikqM,Okay that was pretty solid. I think you underestimated Mid-Atlantic support and Illinois (plus Jersey) is insanely close which definitely helped Trump cement that popular vote.
sSP-2R5ikqM,This video was probably the best prediction I've seen so far.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Bruh Trump did even better
sSP-2R5ikqM,Nailed it!  ** BOOM **
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Excellent prediction, Mister."
sSP-2R5ikqM,"I hate to be that guy, but I made a prediction weeks ago that Trump would win all 7 swing states."
sSP-2R5ikqM,W
sSP-2R5ikqM,You actually underestimated Trump in Michigan lmao
sSP-2R5ikqM,Trump already won guys
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Red Eagle thank you for your coverage, you helped me since spring have a hope of winning this thing!"
sSP-2R5ikqM,good job!
sSP-2R5ikqM,"We did it, democracy wins 🇺🇲"
sSP-2R5ikqM,You were right. I was an idiot.
sSP-2R5ikqM,I thought you were crazy saying Florida was Safe. Now I feel crazy.
sSP-2R5ikqM,NBC CALLED GEORGIA
sSP-2R5ikqM,Liberal hivemind  sent me here
sSP-2R5ikqM,Please check Forsyth County in GA. North of Atlanta. It used to be the reddest county there.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"sorry bub, cheeto is not gonna win this election. He never was. We booted him in 2020 for a reason.  Figure it out or don't but cheeto will never see the inside of the White House again. Many of us are not happy about being called a ""sucker"" and ""loser."" You can take that to the bank"
sSP-2R5ikqM,My prediction....Trump 329-209!!  It's MAGA time!
sSP-2R5ikqM,I am a Pennsylvanian and I made sure all my family voted. All but 1 of em voted red. Cant wait to see us glow red in a few weeks!
sSP-2R5ikqM,I hope your predictions are better than your 22 projections!
sSP-2R5ikqM,Good work
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Trump needs either Wisco or Penn to win it all, and its a VERY big tossup IMO it could go either way we will see what happens"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Never underestimate the dumocrats ability and willingness to cheat.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Close the gap
sSP-2R5ikqM,I just did my part and voted for Trump and Republicans down ballot in Solid Republican West Virginia!
sSP-2R5ikqM,"No matter who wins or how big Trump wins tonight,
I think it looks like the election will be r1gged - even if / when Trump is to win, like regardless!
More than the last time
... -I have a bad feeling! ... ⚠️ 🙁
It's obvious the ""swing states"" already are likely R and have been for a while; the real swing states are ALL the blue ones except DC, VT, MA and MD, so I doubt ""they"" would show the public how much the American voters really voted in favor of Trump due to a ""too big"" landslide, which they are too embarassed to show (they=the Mach1ne)"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Red Eagle Produces far superior election coverage than the sclerotic lefty media ever did.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Just voted Trump in FL, remember though our trust is not in man but in Jesus! Psalm 118:8."
sSP-2R5ikqM,This guy took an L in 2020. And a bigger L in 2022. Why listen to him ? He sucks
sSP-2R5ikqM,"I pray that you're right Red Eagle, so we can work on saving America!"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Florida is not in the 10% realm by a long shot. You also did not factor in the women vote.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"F*** polling, theres no support for KAHMAHLAH."
sSP-2R5ikqM,I influenced 7 kids including my children and their friends to vote. All males in their 20s. I live in California
sSP-2R5ikqM,Thanks. Trump 2024
sSP-2R5ikqM,""" Government is the entertainment division of the Military Industrial Complex."" Frank Zappa"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Hope for live coverage today
sSP-2R5ikqM,Far cry from your 312 you've been predicting for Trump for weeks... Nice to see that you are getting a little bit more real about it... It will be stole and Harris will win... They are already claiming issues with ballots in PA and a judge has extended voting hours 2 more hours.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Polls are worthless. Just the media begging for attention.
sSP-2R5ikqM,I'm not very confident in pa hopefully I'm wrong . Pa voted for Fetterman in 2020 I can't forget about it!
sSP-2R5ikqM,"In almost every metric, the Biden/Harris admin has been a detriment to this country. Its crazy how Democrat voters are willing to sacrifice the betterment of this country for power."
sSP-2R5ikqM,Is REP gonna be live im assuming for election night?
sSP-2R5ikqM,Mt wife said that she wanted to vote for harris because of the abortion issue. That was all she knew about her.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Hey aren't the guy caught trying to manipulate SoCal Strategies poll? How can we trust anything you say?
sSP-2R5ikqM,I dont vote for loxist's politicians.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Sticker shock over the economy is going to sway most new voters who are having a tough time finding jobs and making ends meet.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Go Trump. We HAVE to get him over the finish line. The future of our country depends on it!
sSP-2R5ikqM,The main thing we need a republican majority in the house and senate. It would be great to have President Trump back in the Whitehouse without a lot of rinos to get the nation back in its feet
sSP-2R5ikqM,It's really sickening that so many Americans vote for Kamala Harris. Stupid people are the real problem.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Thank you for realistic prediction! Let’s hope it’s right or better, some of these other channels predictions are absolutely delusional!! It’s a relief to hear common sense."
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Trump will win 40 states.
Trump / Vance 2024 🇺🇲"
sSP-2R5ikqM,What method of cheating are the Dems going to use tonight?
sSP-2R5ikqM,Just voted today for trump❤
sSP-2R5ikqM,EVERYONE GO VOTE!!! YOU DON’T WANT TO HAVE ANY REGRETS IF TRUMP LOSES YOUR STATE BY ONE VOTE!!!! IT’S POSSIBLE WITH HOW CLOSE THIS ELECTION IS!!!
sSP-2R5ikqM,I'm a democrat but I still respect your predictions because they seem a lot more nuanced than most predictions on youtube.
sSP-2R5ikqM,There is absolutely no chance the political deep state establishment will allow a Trump victory.
sSP-2R5ikqM,I Hope & Pray this is how it will go. A Trump WIN. TO BIG TO RIG.
sSP-2R5ikqM,I live in the fox cities and work in green bay and by far there are more trump signs than  harris signs
sSP-2R5ikqM,"@RedEaglePolitics Could you please cover the latest Atlas poll? I have seen very interesting insights there that the other pollsters are missing, it suggest a red wave over all swing states."
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Can't wait to get home this evening and watch the live stream. Hope you are right but also, I want to win MI so badly"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Will you be on a live channel?
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Don’t know if this means much but if it helps Election Prediction official, a more independent predictor, had almost the same numbers as Red eagle except for Wisconsin going narrowly blue instead of red, which I was surprised by."
sSP-2R5ikqM,Just popped in because I had forgotten what delusion looked like. Here’s some engagement for the algorithm so others can be reminded as well.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Vote people!!
sSP-2R5ikqM,"As a Korean-American whos lived here in Baltimore for 50yrs, I can promise you that the Asian community nationwide are strong conservatives and Christians. Although our population is minimal, we support Trump like many minorities."
sSP-2R5ikqM,Garbage day is finally here.  Save the country!
sSP-2R5ikqM,REP actual reasonable prediction before GTA 6
sSP-2R5ikqM,Michigan is a tough state because the 3 women who run this state are corrupt.
sSP-2R5ikqM,So let see how well your track record will continue... you really  wrong in 2020 and 2022...  good luck.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Like many other predictions of REP, I have a feeling this one wont age well also, but I will be back here after the elections"
sSP-2R5ikqM,I will have a party is America is Save.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Go out and vote today, tomorrow start working for JD Vance 2028!"
sSP-2R5ikqM,You sound like an election fraud denier 😅
sSP-2R5ikqM,Did you factor in the blatant steal where they call the bluff of the entire country and then it’s all over forever
sSP-2R5ikqM,W TRUMP W TRUMP 🇮🇹❤️❤️❤️👍👍💪from ITALY
sSP-2R5ikqM,Trump will win today…..tomorrow we will find out the dems won.    Welcome to a repeat of 2020 folks.
sSP-2R5ikqM,As someone from Northern Ireland who is Ulster-Scot (Scotch-Irish); I would like the people in USA to vote for Trump so that we have no more wars and peace again. Also vote so much that the stuff that happened during 2020 doesn’t change the result and we don’t see the swing States shutting down at night and trucks of ballots appear for Harris at 3am. Good luck!
sSP-2R5ikqM,I've said all along.. the Arab and Muslim vote will push Trump over the top
sSP-2R5ikqM,"I'm telling you man. I work at a university. Yes, most of them are liberals.

But HOLY SHIT is it slipping! I am listening to my students conversations while they work on group assignments and they are NOT into this woke idiocy."
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Vote! Make this prediction a reality, even an underestimation of Trump's victory!"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Too big for the Socialists to groom the steal???
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Boy, unfortunately you will be wrong as always😢🥱"
sSP-2R5ikqM,These videos and content have been extremely insightful and helpful in weeding out the manipulation in polling that seems so common. Many thanks!
sSP-2R5ikqM,Virginia is going to flip
sSP-2R5ikqM,How is it this close when you can't hardly find a Harris voter anyplace everyone is for Trump!!!!
sSP-2R5ikqM,We had alot of confidence in him last time. Im not so much this time. Bunch of votes are gonna show up in the middle of the night tonight.
sSP-2R5ikqM,It’s time to bring the Teflon Don back
sSP-2R5ikqM,The big thing with the polls that report registered dem/rep voters is that it doesn't take into account the dem voters who have had enough and who voted Trump this year
sSP-2R5ikqM,Let's go Trump!
sSP-2R5ikqM,Who care they is going to what they want to doing anyway let them mess up America 😂
sSP-2R5ikqM,What was Michigan
sSP-2R5ikqM,"It’s hard to imagine anyone that would want to vote for 4 more years of this pain, misery and death around the globe and at home"
sSP-2R5ikqM,VOTED FOR TRUMP TODAY!!! LETS GOOOOOOOO
sSP-2R5ikqM,"We have lots of rain and flooding today in Missouri, hoping it doesn't affect the turnout too much."

sSP-2R5ikqM,The likes count on video hidden?
sSP-2R5ikqM,"So many of the new Republican residents in Maricopa County have relocated from California. I voted for Trump last week in Maricopa (early voting drop off) Got a call, a text and found a flyer on my windshield last night notifying me that something is wrong with the signature on my ballot. Wish I had heard the door! Someone wrote please call or come down to City Hall to confirm my signature. I am definitely going down in person to ensure it is truly my ballot and that it is counted properly for Trump! ❤🙏🏼🇺🇸"
sSP-2R5ikqM,That firewall is pretty high in PA is it not REP? Almost 500k votes.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Just voted with my Wife and Daughter.  Michigan 3 votes for Trump.  Lets Go!
sSP-2R5ikqM,You are backpedaling big time on Trump.  Have you been bullshitting us all along???
sSP-2R5ikqM,"PA should be in Trump's column.  However it is also the most likely to be delivered to Kamala via FRAUD.  In order to take it, I believe Trump needs to be ahead by 4% at the close of election day.  If that is true, then he has a chance to win the state a WEEK from now when this screwed up state FINALLY finishes counting votes."
sSP-2R5ikqM,It's too easy to cheat again. They will steal it.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"Me talking to my Grandma this morning after she said she is just too sore to go out and vote today “we shall vote on the beaches, we shall vote on the landing grounds, we shall vote in the fields and in the streets, we shall vote in the hills, WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER!!!!!!!!”"
sSP-2R5ikqM,"This is the last call for the Trump train. Get on, or we're screwed!"
sSP-2R5ikqM,Voted for trump in California!!! MAGA!!!
sSP-2R5ikqM,Hopefully Minnesota flips this election.
sSP-2R5ikqM,I hope this holds better than your final prediction in 2020.
sSP-2R5ikqM,Does this factor in all the shenanigans like the busted water pipe in ATL…. And the stop counting votes in PA????
sSP-2R5ikqM,Just voted Trump from Mass!
sSP-2R5ikqM,"AMERICA, GET OUT AND VOTE FOR DJT & the GOP. The entire world depends on it. Save America — the greatest country on God’s green Earth! God bless y’all, greetings from Italy. 🇺🇸❤️🇮🇹"
sSP-2R5ikqM,"I appreciate all your content. Your opinions are thoughtful and logical.  You never seem to address cheating.  Do you really Biden got a legitimate 81 million votes?  If cheating is not taken into consideration, how does that square with your predictions?"
sSP-2R5ikqM,"I really think you should have gotten of election predictions just check depressed ginger, on point politics and the greatest Gold Crown Politics maybe you will learn something."
sSP-2R5ikqM,I would appreciate a poll watching guide. What should we look for at 7? At 8? What would it mean if there are or are not early calls in certain states? Thanks.
sSP-2R5ikqM,biggest shenanigans will happen in Pennsylvania and Michigan
sSP-2R5ikqM,We have one day to save our c country. Go out and vote vote vote
sSP-2R5ikqM,Trump has a zero percent chance to win and I have believed this for like two years. If I am wrong and Trump wins come back and laugh at me but you won't because Trump will lose.
sSP-2R5ikqM,I wont be able to watch results tonite. I know there will be shenanigan's

sSP-2R5ikqM,I live in Connecticut and work in Massachusetts. I've seen a LOT of Trump signs in both states. I wouldn't be surprised if you see a good number of red counties in both states.
sSP-2R5ikqM,"A question  has been bugging me for some time.  I'd be interested to hear your thoughts...
Election cheating in Philadelphia, Chicago and Clark County NV (and others) is spoken of as though it's just an _open secret._  Like systemic cheating is just an accepted part of the machine.
If it actually happens, if it's actually systemic... how has no one stepped in to EXPOSE it and STOP it???"

sSP-2R5ikqM,"It is not true that there aren't a lot of undecideds. Yes, the partisans and enthused will not switch camps. The undecided is debating between the candidates and whether it's worth it to them to get off the couch. THAT is the undecided voter and there are a LOT."
sSP-2R5ikqM,"I cannot even imagine with the state of the world, the economy, that Islamic terrorist trying to take over... There any sane person Democrat or otherwise would vote for Kamala Harris.

1_JaMEGR-7s,"I’ve been watching your videos for some months, and you consistently had Donald Trump sweeping the swing states. I remember being a little doubtful, but you proved you know your stuff. Congratulations and thank you for your hard work."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Uhh he won
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I think this was good analysis, I saved this video to comment after a Donald Trump Victory. 300 + electoral plus likely popular vote....went horribly for candidate Harris."

1_JaMEGR-7s,Harris wins. Sadly
1_JaMEGR-7s,You still think he's going to win? I think he will lose with about 5% or less
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Hey MAGA, come back here Nov 6th and share your tears with me as you scream “iT wAs StOLen” 

😂😂😂"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"No, it's NOT likely to be over on Tuesday.  That's not enough time to ""complete"" the count."
1_JaMEGR-7s,If Harris was smart she would have taken her campaign funds to sponsor cage fights and professional wrestling on Election Day. This would have kept the majority of Trump supporters home and away from the ballot box
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I'm really curious why you believe the Keys to the Whitehouse is wrong this time -- it's been right on every election with the only *debatable* exception of Bush/Gore, and has been backtested back to 1860"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Liberty or death. Trump 2024!
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Don't be too overconfident folks, the Left and their globalist overlords might cheat and swap the results - and we'll be cooked, and America's done."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I worked on my 23 y/o son who never voted before for 2 years with truthful, however biased Trump propaganda. Finally with the many embarrassing screw-ups by the Democrats and the totality of deceitful media more and more obvious he’s convinced and he’s voting Republican. This is very hard to do with non-political individuals who purposely ignore painful, uncomfortable things like everything to do with politics. I don’t have the strength to convince any more non-political normies or God forbid any regular Democrat voters."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Does anybody else believe that the way that the information about these polls is collected and distributed is to build a narrative more than to give us actual information?

How is it that they have been so wrong every single time over the last couple elections.

Particularly, in 2016, we were being told that Hillary was going to win in a landslide.

I can’t help but think that the money paid towards these pollsters is money being spent to find the data that the spender wants to find, and the pollster wants to have a job…

How much of what we have been seeing in the polls, was to build the idea in our heads that Kamala Harris, one of if not the most unpopular vice president in history, suddenly was leading by any margin?

Was it so that we looked at it and thought that she was a serious and viable option? 

And now is Trump being shown to be doing better because they want  blue voters to feel like their vote is absolutely crucial?

And/or, did the pollsters come closer to the actual vote right towards the end after doing all of this so that they can try and say that they have credibility during the next election cycle?

It’s just hard to believe that the American people were so stupid that out of nowhere, for a person that they didn’t even elect and didn’t like and was chosen just for the virtue of being a DEI candidate prior to being selected, twice failing upwards, that they were winning by a good margin in popularity…."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"If the result is the same as the one you predicted in 2020, we are good 😂. Bias never works"
1_JaMEGR-7s,lets NOT KID OURSELVES THEY HAD COUNTERFEIT BALLOTS LAST TIME.  BIDEN NEVER GOT 80 MILLION VOTES LAST TIME AND WE KNOW IF HARRIS GETS MILLIONS OF VOTES WE ARE IN FRAUDSVILLE SINCE SHE CANT OPEN HER MOUTH WITHOUT STUMBLING OVER NONSENSE.

1_JaMEGR-7s,DONALD TRUMP back to the White House! 
1_JaMEGR-7s,The republicans need to brace themselves. I see within the next 10 years. The Christian vote leaving them. The fact the party no longer voices pro life and takes the cheap way out saying the states can decide. It’s a slippery slope to the next cycle just saying we’re good with how it is. I can see the rise of a 3rd party coming.
1_JaMEGR-7s,1 reason why trump isnt ganna win   the rig is to big
1_JaMEGR-7s,Soooo..if Trump wins big...will ghese pollsters say they failed!!!
1_JaMEGR-7s,PLus 6 for Trump from us in CA.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Your country is so divided and racist, it's the brunt of jokes across the world. Trump is only going to make that worse. You think you're getting something with him--he doesn't even respect registered Republicans and his MAGA followers. He thinks you're all stupid and only wants you to pay for his and his rich friend's lifestyle. Go ahead, support a racist woman-hater. If he wins, you'll regret it as he only cares about himself. He's a charlatan, liar, rapist, money-laundering, crap-hawking felon."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Postal votes and dominion voting machines means trump has no chance.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Who else thinks that this guy and LTE would make the most adorable couple in the world? Maybe Trump and Biden could even make them a part of the family after they get married themselves!

1_JaMEGR-7s,I just voted for Trump today in Michigan!
1_JaMEGR-7s,"VOTE TRUMP TO SAVE THE CATS, DUCKS AND NOW SQUIRRELS AND RACCOONS."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"But for their cheating. Evidence of cheating is already out. Computer fondling, illegals voting, etc."
1_JaMEGR-7s,They're going to pull the same 💩 again. Especially here in PA.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump 2024
1_JaMEGR-7s,"All polling still shows Harris +1 over all. It has narrowed from +3, but it still looks like Trump will lose again. I hope I'm wrong, but none of the data backs up your assertions. I keep hearing about Trump leading in the polls for the last week or so, but I've only seen a couple of outlier polls saying that, and they only have him up 1-1.5 ."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Projection doesn’t matter, if you truly care for the future of America, go vote for Trump, doesn’t matter if you reside in a deep blue state, go exercise your right as an American & so NO to the far left"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Voted Trump in kansas
1_JaMEGR-7s,I do want to take the time to thank you and your companion depressed Ginger for all you’ve put into this election. Trust is something that is not easily given like respect. Both must be earned and of all the channels I’ve watched yours are the ones I like the best.again thank you
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Four reasons he might not: dead, illegal, imaginary “voters” and 3AM vote “counters.”"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Let's defeat the demon-hyena Harris?
1_JaMEGR-7s,Voted Trump in PA!
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump here but I'm still nervous.  Could they cheat enough?

1_JaMEGR-7s,"If kamala harris becomes the President, the euthanized squirrel and raccoon will be praying for your safety  from animal heaven."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"If you live in swing states knock doors. If not send texts and calls to Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Voted Red all down the ticket. BUT, we cannot be over confident based on polling data. Remember in 2016, the Hillary Nuts were saying it was going to be a slam dunk win with Killary kicking DJTs arse based upon the polling data right up to and into the early hours of election night. Vote, get your friends, their family, their neighbors, their friends and get them to the polling booth to vote Red as well. We need every possible Red vote or this whole country will look like Russia in the early 20th century under Marxism."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Why are we talking about polling? Who is voting?
1_JaMEGR-7s,They're desperately spreading lies in iowa. Vote Trump!
1_JaMEGR-7s,I can think of a HUNDRED.😊😊😊😊😊
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I’m in Massachusetts, and I am voting Trump.  If in a blue state, especially vote for Trump.  It helps the popular vote, but it’s the right thing.  People have died so we can have this privilege.  It’s the least thing we can do.

California was once a red state.  The Democrats chipped away with illegal immigration.  Never give up on flipping it back some day.  The Democrats never quit, so why should we?"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"They are already finding case after case of fraud in key states, of course the democrats never seem to find the problems.  They only admit to it once it gets busted. .  Trump has already lost due to the fix."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"they found 164,000 duplicated votes in Detroit Michigan... i predict that there will be more votes than voters in quite a few states."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Trump  Trump Trump Trump Trump for 2034 for President !!!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"selzer poll is a bummer, eh?"
1_JaMEGR-7s,TRUMP& VANCE 2024
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Come on Michigan you know what to do we can’t do another 4 years of Democrats in charge?

Vote Trump"
1_JaMEGR-7s,I expect to hear the tormented screams of the Hard Left on election night.
1_JaMEGR-7s,I just going to remind you this channel claimed last midterms would be a landslide and we all know the story. Go to frikking vote. If 80% of the country vote for Trump dems are done
1_JaMEGR-7s,Democrats are cheating again
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Still get out and vote for trump people there is youtube channels being paid by Harris and co to make out trump has already won and it makes people think they dont need to vote, Harris has already been cought out with hundreds of thousands of duplicate votes, if get out and vote"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Polls are worthless. Don't forget to vote.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"IGNORE EVERYTHING!!!!! Don't get complacent!!!! Don't get blackpilled!!!! Get your asses out there and VOTE!!!! If we stay home and don't vote, then they'll steal the election!!!! We need to make this TOO BIG TO RIG!!!!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"There is literally only 1 thong that's not favoring Trump, and that is the corrupt people in power, determined to cheat and break any laws needed to stop Trump."
1_JaMEGR-7s,To the white house President Trump
1_JaMEGR-7s,Pa is going for Trump
1_JaMEGR-7s,PLEASE vote!
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Abortion has NOTHING to do with Kamala.  The supreme court voted to send it back to the state level.  So, if people want to change abortion rights, vote for your local leaders, but don't vote for Kamala just because of abortion!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump does not seem stressed at all. He has access to internal polling showing him up and winning.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Bro is not going to be happy about the polls, Trump is losing in every swing state and poly maket is crashing for Trump LOOOOOL"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Will you delete your channel when Harris wins? Or can you continue after yet another failed prediction
1_JaMEGR-7s,And I think the mainstream media has earned the mistrust of the people especially when it comes to the 100% fake news network known as MSNBC where every second of runtime they have ever released since inception have verifiably been false.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"The fundamentals were in Trump’s favor in 2020 (good economy for the incumbent, etc.). So wouldn’t count on that for 2024. I think the abortion issue is going to be a challenge for republicans, as it was in 2022."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Great analysis! Thanks much!
God bless all here."
1_JaMEGR-7s,why was there a harris add on your page
1_JaMEGR-7s,Too much cheating in Big cities like PA AND Others !! Only God can  decide!!🙏🏻🙏🏻
1_JaMEGR-7s,Everything you just pointed out in this video has 1 big enemy and may swing us towards a dystopian future... and that's just how fucking stupid human beings truly are when it comes down to it.
1_JaMEGR-7s,He isn't
1_JaMEGR-7s,You will be vindicated.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Please dear lord don’t let them cheat.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Why has the betting odds dropped by 10. It's a huge morale loss for me.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Trump will win NV, AZ, GA, NC, PA, and WI. He will lose MI, the total electoral votes for him will be 297 and 241 for Kamala. Trump wins his second term."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Voted for Trump here in SC
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Add Justice for Peanut 🐿️ Murderest Government Over Reach.  Federal officers raided the guy’s house with freak’n rifles, took his pet that he rescued 7 years ago and then they fuck’n kill it⁉️ Way to go NY Democrats 🤬"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I don't know how anyone could not love Trump and I don't know it's because he's originally from Queens New York like I am but I love everything from his sarcastic sense of humor, and work ethic to fulfilling all of the promises he's ever made the way no other president ever has."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Cope bro the new Des Moines poll
Shows Harris up 3"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Iowa poll came out. It’s over
1_JaMEGR-7s,Wokeism has poisoned the Democrat Party.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Does anyone know the likelihood that we find out who wins by midnight on election night?
1_JaMEGR-7s,I'll be voting for TRUMP on Election Day!!!
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Just voted early today, place was packed!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,A Des Moines Iowa register came out with Trump trailing Harris by three in the multi candidate race? That worries me.
1_JaMEGR-7s,He might win on Tuesday but they wont stop counting for several days.  Plenty of time for the commies to manufacture votes.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Cult leader down 3 in Iowa A+ Pollster
1_JaMEGR-7s,Minnesotan here voted Trump!
1_JaMEGR-7s,It's going to come down the wire either way. Each candidate will get over 200 electoral votes regardless of who wins.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"*Hey, Red Eagle:  you need to start worrying about the popularity of your cult leader IN IOWA.  Selzer poll has Kamala up by 3.*"
1_JaMEGR-7s,bigger than 2016

1_JaMEGR-7s,"My prediction for 2024 election, I think Trump will narrowly win the election 297-241.  I have Trump winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada (less than 1 point), Arizona (1-2 points), Georgia and North Carolina (2-3 points).  I see him losing Michigan (by less than 1 point).  I also have Democrats winning the House 221-214 while the GOP takes the Senate 51-49 (I think the GOP wins all their Senate seats and flip West Virginia and Montana and almost won Ohio)."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Final poll new york times pensylvania trump +1
1_JaMEGR-7s,Will Red Eagle be Live On Election Day??
1_JaMEGR-7s,I guess this is Trump channel **hides with Blue Wave*** boo trump! 
1_JaMEGR-7s,Didn't you sponsor a poll that was just released saying Kamala +2 in Pennsylvania?
1_JaMEGR-7s,"The cheating tho bro. You always ignore that….for the most part. And we’ve done nothing to fix that. 

AZ PA and GA have already said they won’t have results for up to 2 weeks. You really think these TDS creatures are really going to do it fair and certify the results and award Trump the win? No. 

Pray"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I believe this election is so eerily similar to Clinton's campaign in 2016. Her downfall boiled down to 8 things.

1) Email Controversy
2) Perceived Elitism
3) Focus on attacking Trump as opposed to offering a clear vision
4) Lack of engagement in swing states
5) Voter turnout (didn't galvanize white working- class Americans and younger voters)
6) Overconfidence in polling
7) Third-part candidates (Jill stein in Michigan)
8) Media Coverage (THEY WERE OBSESSED WITH TRUMP!)

With these issues in mind, I see the exact same pattern with Harris aside from issue one. While Harris has improved on engaging in swing states (PA, MI, and WI), it feels like it hasn't been enough especially in the very limited time has had. The polling issue is strange this time around considering Trump is ahead in nearly every swing state and the popular vote for the first time ever (based off of RCP). The polls this time around could be doing one of three things:


1) underestimating him
2) overestimating
3) They are very close (aside from the ones saying Harris are like +6 in Michigan)

Historically they have underestimated him so I believe (but i do not guarantee) they will underestimate him again. With all this in mind, I'm curious if anybody else has noticed this trend and what they think. (Comparing this election to 2016 is not a exact one to one comparison due to changing demographics, rather this is a simply observation with my justification)"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Everyone knows trump wins a fair election. The only question that remains is how far they are preppared to go to stop him.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Don’t let them don’t get complacent and don’t believe the polls get out and vote so Trump win get out and vote no excuses take a bus drive get a ride walk ride a bike use roller skates and if your on a island take a bottle get out and vote make sure Herris losses
1_JaMEGR-7s,I will be surprised if Trump wins.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Michigan & Pennsylvania get those Trump Ballots in. Trump2024
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Explain to me how in the world Kamala will win, for example, California. The voters saw she basically destroyed the state. So they basically say: You made a mess of our state, please destroy it completely. Ludicrous!!!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Everybody here needs to call friends and relatives and make sure they go vote for TRUMP
1_JaMEGR-7s,Amen ❤
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Win on Tuesday, but lose on Wednesday"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Voted for Trump for the first time (was too young in 2016 and 2020) as a 21 year old in Virginia. Waited an hour in line but he took a bullet for us, its only fair we take some time out of our day to vote for him. Let’s hope for a red virginia and a trump victory this tuesday!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Only 1100 comments, that is not enough to convince me, He will lose and it will be a blue wave. 
Early voting data (woman)."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Yes, the numbers look better from Trump than in the past two elections, but I'm still worried that the Democrats will try to pull something to drag Harris across the finish line and get away with it. I will say in a fair election, I believe Trump wins."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Two more videos for you to do before election.

One more election prediction 

And then the 13keys being debunked. I think Allan lichtman is being a bad faith actor for this cycle, still he predicted a lot of elections.

I think Trump has a 99.99 chance, those keys are the only .01 that say otherwise and I pray they are wrong."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Oh yes, that's the only reason. lol why he loses. It's not that Communist Party agents illegally changing and breaking federal election laws, illegals voting, mail-in fake ballots. Sure, that's the reason."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Stim. checks, free rent & student loan forgiveness are off the table this time. I think this gave Biden a boost in votes in 2020."
1_JaMEGR-7s,I voted in Florida on the first day of early voting. Florida is a red state now but my county will most likely stay blue unless it flips red on Election Day.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Diddy wants you to know he's for Harris.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Damn, what just happened in that SO Cal PA poll?  Hope you have a video on that today and tell us why it’s wrong!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,The demons of the late night Philly ballot dumps are still lurking.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Way to go blue state conservatives.
You will put Trump up in the popular vote (win) and possibly your state will go red.
God bless all of you (from Florida)"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Did be mention esrly voting numbers as one of the reasons.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"He who casts the vote has no power.
He who counts the vote has the power.

That's the reason why Trump loses. Not 10 reasons or 20 or 1000.

Just 1"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"After the actual vote, we should make a website where you can ""vote"" your ballot as you checked the original..at least for the key races.  It would be very interesting to see that count against the official count.  Just here hoping to keep thing honest."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Can you make a video like “is trump’s firewall 262/268 EVs?”
1_JaMEGR-7s,"If you take out the cheating and illegal votes, he wins in a landslide."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Me my family voted for Trump in Brooklyn NYC
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump is doing way better than anyone gives him credit for. These numbers among minorities are unheard of for the republican party. I hope that this was all just an identity crisis for America and we will see the return of normalcy with a Donald Trump presidency.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I hope you're right, voted for Trump here in Georgia. I just hope he flips one of the Blue Wall States"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Interesting implication, if you connect your statements at ~8:00. ;)"
1_JaMEGR-7s,Is the Vice President (Harris) going to be certifying this election in Congress? Could be some hinkey 💩going on in January!
1_JaMEGR-7s,"On election night, they will close down N. Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and the corrupt blue wall..."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump screwed. You just don't know or care yet.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Terrifically thiughtful and persuasive!! THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR FINE WORK. I wish i could afford some of your merch. The McDonald's and garbage truck wii become iconic.
1_JaMEGR-7s,North Carolina lets goo 👊🇺🇸 I certainly hope the downed ballot effect with Trump affects our governor's race. Can't stand the idea of Josh Stein winning
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Does Trump kill and butcher innocent squirrels? No, that’s what the democrat government of NY does."
1_JaMEGR-7s,This analysis is irrelevant. Election fraud takes away all these reasons. Thousands of illegal mail in ballots will flood in and Trump voter ballots will be trashed on midnight on Election Day in swing states. Harris wins. Suck it up America.
1_JaMEGR-7s,He doesn't win if you don't vote.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump SHOULD win but I’m sad to say I have ZERO confidence in the integrity of our elections and ZERO confidence in the integrity of the media. 🙄
1_JaMEGR-7s,They will keep counting until Kamala is declared winner. All hell breaks loose. I hate being this cynical but there is no limit how far the regime will go.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"My mom, husband and I all early voted for Trump/Vance/Cruz in Texas!!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,VOTE NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE AND NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES.  PREPARE FOR A LONGER WAIT THE USUAL ❤
1_JaMEGR-7s,15:45 That and the massive cheating and fraud by the Democrats.
1_JaMEGR-7s,All my friends and family and I voted for Donald Trump and mailed in their ballots for Donald Trump and I voted for Donald Trump yesterday on for Michigan we need a change Donald Trump 2024
1_JaMEGR-7s,Thank you!!!👊🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🤝TRUMP/ VANCE LANDSLIDE VICTORY THIS NOVEMBER 5TH ELECTION WIN!!!👍👏😉
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Never underestimate the dems propensity for cheating! Count on it...they will pull something. There will be challenges to the election results, for who knows how long, if Trump wins. They will try to not certify him. Cheating will be rampant.  To have a chance, Trump needs a blowout win. Let's hope and pray for that."
1_JaMEGR-7s,He has 10 times the people voting for him.🙂😇
1_JaMEGR-7s,VOTE VOTE VOTE
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I'm so glad that Trump is still ahead, it seems he's been on fire. He seems unstoppable so far.  Both my husband and I are voting for Trump, he's our guy for 2024."
1_JaMEGR-7s,I have looked forward to your show everyday of this election cycle.  Voted Trump and a straight republican ticket here in CA.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"The ""Nazi"" & ""fascist"" trope is farcical. Are Tulsi, Nicole, RFKJr, Musk, Ron Paul, Vivek, Hulk Hogan, Dana White, etc. Nazis? C'mon Democrats & MSM, no one who isn't mentally ill believes that."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"The Native American vote in AZ is 6%, in NM 11% & the dominant tribes are coming out YUGE for Trump, with GOOD reasons: what he did for them when President, & what he's offering now. Please  take it into account. Also the new support from Ron Paul joining Musk's DOGE. Ron Paul has a strong Independent loyal constituency that will now have a voice."
1_JaMEGR-7s,Are you gonna have a live stream on Tuesday night?
1_JaMEGR-7s,Everyone come back Weds. Let's see how close this is.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Gen Z Fiancé and I voted Trump for the third time in blue Lexington, KY! The early voter line was 3 hours long."
1_JaMEGR-7s,He’s only up by 3 in Ohio bros he’s fucking done
1_JaMEGR-7s,Michiganders for Trump
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Voted for Trump in Illinois 

My state will vote for Kamala but good luck to everyone else. Go out and vote!"
1_JaMEGR-7s,😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂 What a silly goose you are. Trump has a better chance of ending up in a jump suit that matches his orange spray tan.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Completely false information again. Don’t be fooled by this nonsense. You can’t rely on these polls. According to my sources Kamala Harris will win easily over Trump.
1_JaMEGR-7s,I voted for Trump. In fact i voted republican up and down the ballot from dog catcher to president.

1_JaMEGR-7s,The hidden gem for President Trump in Pennsylvania is the Amish vote. They tend not to participate in polling and stay out of politics unless their way of life is at risk. The regulations under the current administration are greatly affecting the small businesses that the Amish control. They may vote in much higher numbers this time around as they have a community purpose for doing so. Their support for President Trump is evident by posters on their property and on their buggys. It will be interesting to see how they do or don't affect the outcome of the election.
1_JaMEGR-7s,10 reasons!? You only need one reason… he’s not a commie
1_JaMEGR-7s,Let's make it too big to rig 💪🇺🇸💪
1_JaMEGR-7s,idiots get to the point
1_JaMEGR-7s,Nevada for Trump.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"If Trump picked up Neveda and New Hampshire ( could happen), he wouldn't even need Wisconsin"
1_JaMEGR-7s,We have to fight with our votes for president Trump to save our country. The sick dems are cheating every where
1_JaMEGR-7s,The 400k vote firewall for Democrats in Pennsylvania and elevated women turnout are the only things that I cant put my mind to ease over..
1_JaMEGR-7s,I am sure trump will win if there is no cheating!!!
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump has the divine will of God behind him. He cannot lose.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"I hope you are right, but as of November 2, Kamala has taken a narrow lead in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Polls are snapshots and they aren't always accurate, so we won't know for sure for another 3 days, but I am on pins and needles."
1_JaMEGR-7s,I have picked out a red polo shirt for my trip to the polls on Tuesday.
1_JaMEGR-7s,C'mon NM!  You can do it!
1_JaMEGR-7s,You have to see it the positive way:Donald Trump will be known as the only president to be elected three times.Huge.
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Democrat's are going to steal it. Already got the word. People here are to complacent, Dominion machines they can do anything they're run in Serbia"
1_JaMEGR-7s,The democrats have good fraud/cheating game in the rust belt.
1_JaMEGR-7s,I and my wife voted for trump early here in NJ.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Who in the world thinks Kamala has the ability to be leader of the free world and run the entire country?
1_JaMEGR-7s,Trump is going to lose. The polls are wrong.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Rigged. There's no chance.
1_JaMEGR-7s,Good video.
1_JaMEGR-7s,My granddaughters went trick or treating and someone gave them a new copy of our constitution. They got one last year too! Trump24❤❤❤
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Without cheating and stealing votes, the Democrates can't win"
1_JaMEGR-7s,"using logical reasoning on why people should vote trump is meaningless.  half this country vote by feeling not logic.  it's the absolute reason why trump ""lost"" in 2020."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"DON'T GET COMPLACENT! Vote for Trump like he's behind. Get your family, friends, and neighbors out to vote (but only if they're voting for Trump) like they'll get enslaved into combat in WWIII if they don't, because they likely will. And then don't just vote! Watch the polls like they're your children and you're trapped on Jeffrey's Island, because both will get stolen from you if you aren't eternally vigilant. And if, or more likely when they try to pull another 2020, we need to be recording their every move, then storm Twitter like we stormed the ballot boxes and show all the world their sedition."
1_JaMEGR-7s,"Excellent analysis, thanks!"
t3xqwAaatl8,"""I'll compromise on X"". They never do. They don't know what a compromise is, a compromise is both sides letting go a bit in order to find middle ground. What they're doing is tying the rope to a Dodge Ram and telling you that you need to compromise again and again

A compromise isn't ""National gun registry"". A compromise is ""National gun registry but we can buy whatever weapons we want. Machineguns, SBRs, mortars, tanks etc."", both sides need to win something in order to call it a compromise. I wouldn't support this either because my stance on 2A is that it's absolute but that's an example of a compromise. They just keep hitting the debates with ultimatums and emotional manipulation"
t3xqwAaatl8,"Answer,  Not really."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump isn’t;t perfect on guns, or anything else. He is just vastly better on everything than any democrat. And that goes double for Kamala."
t3xqwAaatl8,He’s all talk. His side had the means to ram home the HPA and reciprocity bill but nothing happened.
t3xqwAaatl8,"yeah, what he said!"
t3xqwAaatl8,Bruen decision let me carry in California. Thanks Trump 🇺🇸
t3xqwAaatl8,Keep up the good work Colion Noir.
t3xqwAaatl8,Please stop the slamming noise!
t3xqwAaatl8,"Lets NOT bring up trumpys assassination attempt, that had FAKE Blood & a staged Photo Op...Its all a Dog & Pony Show."
t3xqwAaatl8,"So, you are okay with a liberal Republican, take stance on both sides concerning the 2A, to be the president of the US. Is he better than Kamala? Sure. But thats like saying its better to be shot by a 5.56 than a .30-06. Either way, you get shot. We screwed up in 2016, in the Primary, when we COULD have got a real Conservative."
t3xqwAaatl8,A bumpstock on its own  won't  save your bacon.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Funny story, It doesn't matter if he does or not"
t3xqwAaatl8,I STILL DONT COMPLEATLY TRUST DONALD
t3xqwAaatl8,can police that are in question have their guns removed???? REDFLAG
t3xqwAaatl8,"Battlefield weapon ? Like from 3,4, hardline ? Which one"
t3xqwAaatl8,"I’m perplexed as to why Trump doesn’t tell the no guns crowd that, a gun is a tool, the intent and mind of the fool with the gun is causing the harm to others, my guns have never harmed anyone and I’ve been strapped daily for over forty years"
t3xqwAaatl8,"Sounds like she was trying to say ""Tac Action""...Oh, tactical action, okay, gotcha!! 😂😂😂"
t3xqwAaatl8,"No matter what he said, he's better than Kalama."
t3xqwAaatl8,Not sure about Amy and the 2A.
t3xqwAaatl8,"If you are anti 2A in any way you are my enemy. He's proven unreliable and so has the rest besides Ron Paul maybe. Neither will get my vote because of them both supporting extreme risk protection orders, AKA Red flag laws."
t3xqwAaatl8,"""Get the guns first, then worry about due process"" 
What happened in the first two years of his term where there was a Republican majority in boht the house and the senate. NO new 2A legislation, NO anti 2A legislation or ATF rules repealed. They all ran on being pro 2A, then did nothing to overturn decades of 2A compromises and concessions."
t3xqwAaatl8,"This is damned helpful, especially considering that election day is close...  Gives me a tiny but useful Cliffs Notes guide into how Trump might view passing 2A-related bills and such."
t3xqwAaatl8,Why don't you invite him to your channel?  That would be great to see.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Take the guns first, due process later....... DJT"
t3xqwAaatl8,His kids are gun people
t3xqwAaatl8,All must follow the Constitution of the United States of America and the Bill of Rights... End of the🐂💩......
t3xqwAaatl8,Anyone know what country turned around to “support and encourage people to own guns resulting in crime dropping 29%”??
t3xqwAaatl8,Thtat's wrong about national reciprocity. Trump at the same press comference told the republican congress that if they sent national reciprocity to his desk it was dead on arivual and it was said with gusto.
t3xqwAaatl8,More excuses for Trump. The guy signed executive orders that had to be overturned in the supreme courts and supports red flag laws.  These people are like battered wives constantly making excuses for their abusers actions
t3xqwAaatl8,🤞😏🤞
t3xqwAaatl8,No.  Easy answer.  He may very well be the one to disarm the population…and they will willingly bow down to him.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Already voted Trump, and yeah he's not perfect by any stretch. One of his greatest failings to me was on one of my top issues. I do Not however think he wants to hassle people about their '15's (not sure what makes a comment not post, this platform is a miserable place) If that were important to him, well he's already dodged one and hasn't said a word about control. The opposition? I think they absolutely do want to do that and talk about it openly. Choice is clear to me, one is decent but flawed, the other is an outright evil. Plus? The people he's put into the justice system have proven more than decent imo on the issue, they rule in favor of sense far more than a century worth of control advocates have so I like that. Put it this way, I trust Bumpy Trumpy over gop idol Reagan on the issue."
t3xqwAaatl8,The NRA advised Trump that bumpstocks were “no big deal”.   The real question is: “how pro 2nd Amendment is the NRA?”  Much of the gun community has left the NRA behind over the past 10 years because of their compromising positions and found other avenues to support the 2nd Amendment.
t3xqwAaatl8,Mia Khalifa in the house
t3xqwAaatl8,"What exactly is Trump knee deep in?  I don't know if he'se knee deep in ANYTHING!  During he first campaign be promised that he would, on day one of his Administration, by executive order, put an end to ""Birthright citizenright"".  Which as far as I'm aware, I and I have looked into this to some extent, is only a misreading of the 14th Amendment by one Federal from back in the mid 1960's.  This misreading has resulted in 10's of millions of illegal aliens, their children and their families wrongly becoming American citizens since then.  Obviously Trump is NOT Kamala and that says a lot in itself but just much can he be relied on to do what he says he's going to do?  Not far in my opinion."
t3xqwAaatl8,"ALL gun control laws violate existing federal laws (H.R. 11654). it is a felony to propose, write, vote in favor of, or enforce ANY gun control law in the united states. H.R. 11654 also states that if the National Guard has an Item (Clothes, vehicles, arms {ANY arms, including Nukes} or other items), Civillians in the US are supposed to be able to purchase them WITH OUT the government knowing you have them."
t3xqwAaatl8,"If he gets another term, it would be amazing if you and a few others like Herrera and Gerald to be like a ""council"" or something of the like regarding 2A."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Answer to the tile... Simply...No, he does not support the 2nd Amendment.  He may be sort of ""pro-gun."" But a supporter and defender of the 2nd Amendment he is not."
t3xqwAaatl8,Seriously? 30 dollars for a tee shirt?
t3xqwAaatl8,"To answer the question in the title of the video, the asnwer is simply ""no"". He's a fake conservative so I just can't get behind him anymore. He's better than Kamel Toe, but not good enough for me."
t3xqwAaatl8,"I agree with the first 1:08 minutes.  I do like his policies, but I'm still not convinced he's 100% pro 2a...  He may have been really pressured to ban the thing that the LV shooter ""supposedly"" used, who knows, but he didn't do a ton of things we all thought he would do for our community when he was in office.  Then again, he really couldnt do ANYTHING because some no name federal judge would pop out of NOWHERE and block EVERY, SINGLE, THING he wanted to do.  So who knows...."
t3xqwAaatl8,"2a is my main issue with him, but have you seen the alternative?"
t3xqwAaatl8,"We can all agree that, by his own words, Trump wants to be a dictator. He admires dictators around the world because they are able to get rid of any dissenting views. Show me one dictator EVER that thought his countries citizens should be armed. There's no chance Trump has ever fired a firearm. The two guns he ""owns"" were given to him and are more collectors items than anything else. That said, I submit to all the responsible gun owners in America that Trump is the biggest threat this country has ever seen to the 2nd Amendment. Once his cult turns on him, and they will, he will drop an order to his goon squads to gather up every gun they can and kill all gun sales to civilians."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump was a NY Liberal for a long time. Still, he gave us a Supreme Court we can point at as mostly supportive. HE is better than the alternative."
t3xqwAaatl8,"He will ban ""assault weapons"""
t3xqwAaatl8,"Sad that so many politicians either don't know the constitution or pretend not to, despite taking an oath to protect it."
t3xqwAaatl8,"So he wanted to take your gun without due process, and you excuse that by saying he didn't mean what he said? Imagine if Obama said anything like that."
t3xqwAaatl8,Colion.. he's a democrat by his mentality..  why ask why on bumpstocks.. #45 is a democrat.. been one for decades.. he couldn't beat Hillary for democratic nomination.. he simply wants power.. he doesn't make decisions.. others make decisions for him.. ever notice how he flip-flops.. those judges that he put in place.. he never would have gotten financial support if he didn't follow advice of those that know where the money is.. check it yourself guy.. You're an attorney.. use resources  !!!!!
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump  was given bad advice from individuals in the NRA about bump stocks and he was dealing with an emotional issue after the horrific mass shooting in Las Vegas. The big mistake was that he was playing right into the hands of the anti 2A crowd who are happy to take a win against the 2A.
t3xqwAaatl8,It doesn't matter to me. I support the 2nd Amendment and that's all that matters.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Thanks for this video. Now we all know that you’re a liar at best.Banning bump stocks because of emotion???? Take the guns then due process? No thanks, shill. I actually enjoyed your videos even when you were shilling for the NRA but this is a bridge too far… liar."
t3xqwAaatl8,Bump stocks are useless anyway so who cares if they are or were banned?
t3xqwAaatl8,"YouTube.com/@colionnoir Although I generally support gun ownership, I find the exclusion of marijuana users from this right to be unconstitutional. A federal judge in Oklahoma has made a similar determination, recognizing the right of marijuana users to bear arms. What’s your opinion on that can you please comment back? I would really appreciate that."
t3xqwAaatl8,Donald trump carries a gun   love collin show trump was gonna make it so  we can carry guns in every state?But they were too busy saying he set up election against hillary  and that he didn't  pay taxes
t3xqwAaatl8,I hope Joe Rogan explains to Trump about the strange rules and Colion helps Joe with that.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Nope won’t get fooled again. 
You can keep your Trump swill."
t3xqwAaatl8,No. He does not. He also doesnt support due process.
t3xqwAaatl8,I was saying this from day 1. Trump headed off the dems at the pass. i didnt luke it but tbe truth is the truth.
t3xqwAaatl8,Chase Oliver of the Libertarian Party is more pro-2A without having excuses made for him…. No chance of winning but MEH 🫤
t3xqwAaatl8,I think his sons advised him on 2nd Amendment and where he went off the on wrong trail.
t3xqwAaatl8,Kinda crazy someone can be freaking persistent and not be efficient in firearms
t3xqwAaatl8,Ive got to wonder about tim waltz being a queen.
t3xqwAaatl8,Old Bernie Sanders was definitely standing there to get his face on tv. Donald Jr is a gun owner and hunter.
t3xqwAaatl8,Trumps sons are real badasses and 2A advocates…
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump is NOT a friend of the 2A. There, saved you 10 minutes of your life."
t3xqwAaatl8,He's said somethings that I don't like about the 2nd but I feel like if we let him know our point of view he would actually listen
t3xqwAaatl8,"The ""assassination attempt"" was obviously totally fake.  Both of them."
t3xqwAaatl8,"😡 Kamala has a gun but she doesn’t support gun laws.

😅Trump said “ Take guns away “ “ Banned the bump stock “ but 🥺 he’s not a gun guy, he didn’t think it was a bud deal, to him it was just a piece of plastic, it’s hard to understand what trump really means some times guys."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump supports the 2nd, because NRA money tells him to, otherwise, he doesn't give a crap about your rights."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump is the best chance we got, don’t become a problem, I’ve watched and respected most of your post, we need to win or we lose big."
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump said he was going to pass constitutional carry for all 50 states
t3xqwAaatl8,What are your thoughts on Project 2025?
t3xqwAaatl8,Sounds like a demo for me.
t3xqwAaatl8,Now the bumpstock is back.
t3xqwAaatl8,Fienfuk
t3xqwAaatl8,He banned bump stocks didn't he?
t3xqwAaatl8,Still love Trump!
t3xqwAaatl8,"There are only two good things that will come out of another Trump Presidency. One is Hooray, Kamala LOSES!. The other is another healthy round of mostly pro-gun judge appointments on SCOTUS and in traditionally anti-gun courts. He is not our friend, but he is not our enemy, and Kamala definitely is the enemy of the Armed Citizen and has said so."
t3xqwAaatl8,Dince the left is really attacking the Bill of Rights and individual freedom . We should staye we bsck snd defend the Bill of Rights . Rights of the people are absolute but no one has a right to misuse s right.
t3xqwAaatl8,Compared to Harris he is a rabid pro 2A supporter
t3xqwAaatl8,"I voted for trump and will continue to do so but from what I understand, donald trump is responsible for more gun control than Obama.   Trump banned the bumpstock."
t3xqwAaatl8,I remember arguing with someone over what it means when a gun is gas operated. He thought it literally ran on gasoline 😂😂
t3xqwAaatl8,"Come over to the fun side
“Become an Ammo Sexual”
Is the greatest line i’ve heard all year🤣👍🏾😂👍🏾🤣"
t3xqwAaatl8,We only have 2 choices & Kamala is not it
t3xqwAaatl8,Well at least trump ain't threatening ppl to come and take your pew pews unlike Harris is wanting to do when and if she wins..
t3xqwAaatl8,I'll be pro ban guns if i have armed bodyguards 24/7 like these constitutionally ignorant folks.
t3xqwAaatl8,Vote Trump
t3xqwAaatl8,e
t3xqwAaatl8,e
t3xqwAaatl8,e
t3xqwAaatl8,I love when these idiot politicians btry to sound likevthey know something about guns
t3xqwAaatl8,Wanting our gun rights taken and actually successfully taking them are two totally different things. Of course they want to take all our guns thats a given. However in the United States of America the states will never get close to martial law
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump gave over 1b in his life to pro gun groups , did fundraisers etc ."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Mr. Colion, I think and believe, that You and Mr. Brandon Herrera of Texas, should offer and be President DJ Trump's ""gun guys""! Man! What a team and job that would be!!!"
t3xqwAaatl8,"His sons are ""big time"" hunters!!"
t3xqwAaatl8,Trumps not a gun guy but I believe his son actively hunts and collects firearms a collab would be fun to see
t3xqwAaatl8,"If you don't support, protect the constitution should never hold any office at all must be deported to North Korea"
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump absolutely supports the 2nd Amendment and gets endorsed by the NRA.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Before more conversion to more guns, I wasn't an anti-gun or pro-gun but I was hugely anti-Democrat. If a Democrat says they are for something I am against it. Back then didn't own a gun have a gun and didn't care but, I always hated Democrats. It wasn't the Democrats as a person but as a political movement and group. This at that time made me pro-gun."
t3xqwAaatl8,"One commentor suggested that all judges should support the Second Amendment. Actually all judges are required to follow real law. The Second Amendment is not open to individual interpretation. In fact, that act is bad behavior by judges and grounds for removal. To continue to support this idea is classic legal double talk. A large part of the justice problem."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Regarding Trump's ""take the guns"" statement. I interpreted as take the guns first, then due process, then if found innocence you simply give it back to them. I get that your rights are temporary violated but it still seemed like a reasonable proposition to me."
t3xqwAaatl8,I need a promo code for this merch lol
t3xqwAaatl8,"6:59 Honestly, I have to give him some major respect for speaking the unpopular truth"
t3xqwAaatl8,"Colion none of them care about the rights of the peasants. They are all aristocrats who are concerned about their own power and wealth. Left and right are two sides of the same coin. I think you know that. Perhaps this is the NRA speaking through you that supports another politician. 

Trump says what he says to get support, when he is elected he will do no such thing. He will carry on as all politicians do. The cope that most normies have is insane. Stop voting for a new master. Lead yourself."
t3xqwAaatl8,I'm not a fan of bump stock.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Independent voters for Harris-Walz 2024
Vote for freedom!🇺🇸"
t3xqwAaatl8,"Sounds like these are excuses for Trump. And he didn't specify ""advocate for people to own the AR15"". He advocated for people to own guns. If gun control gets so bad that all we are ""allowed"" to have are 6 shot revolvers but everything else is banned. Well that's still a gun."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump supports TRUMP !… not America or the American people !  I’m a disabled combat vet ( U.S.M.C.) he calls guys like me suckers and losers who’s been hurt/ injured serving our country When he chose not to do so !  Left or right, NO ONE can/will take my guns !!"
t3xqwAaatl8,"NRA got in his ear and said bro this isn't a good look. And then he walked it back, NOT OFFICIALLY. Did he? What about red flag laws?"
t3xqwAaatl8,So why don't you get a team together and have a deep conversation with President Trump? Instead of guessing you would know exactly where he stands.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Stop.. It doesn't matter how is president, the oligarchy is controlling it. Duh."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Considering his close friendship with the clintons (allegedly ending when he ran on the repub ticket), and his support of the assault weapon ban (even supported the idea of it being reinstated), I have no confidence he supports the 2nd Amendment.  At most, he's a ""I support the 2nd Amendment, but..."" kind of person, which is turncoat speak."
t3xqwAaatl8,Send me a hat and some shirts!
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump may not be a gun expert but he does understand the Bill of Rights like few others. His politics line up with mine, I am a life-long shooter, a committed right winger, I am happy with Donald Trumps stance on 2A. Trump is a quick study, he and Barron could learn about guns quickly--Eric and Don jr are well immersed in the gun culture. I will be voting Trump in Nov."
t3xqwAaatl8,Don't forget he is reactionary and that's the problem. He reacted by directing the ATF to ban bump stocks. Trump also delayed closing borders during Covid to prevent travel from infected countries because of criticism from the left. He seems to be the best viable choice this term but we need much better alternatives at all level of government going forward. It's time to take down the career politicians and the deep state from both the right and the left.
t3xqwAaatl8,You would have to have a polo shirt made for President Trump
t3xqwAaatl8,"I love  trump,  however  je need a guy  like u, an attorney, a 2a guy  , who  needs  a constitutional  Republic  2a ear in his mind.   Go for it , u and candice  Owens,   hell get ted nugent's  mind  in his background  would  be great 👍"
t3xqwAaatl8,It would be freakin epic to see Colion take Trump out to the range.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump's kids, especially Don Jr, are into guns. He has a custom AR-15, or at least has posed with one multiple times.

That's why I don't think gun ownership is at risk if Trump wins a second term. I think his kids would talk him out of it. 

I also think Don Jr is probably why he ""walked back"" that take the guns opinion. I don't think Trump cares what the NRA thinks, but he probably cares what Don Jr thinks."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump doesn't, but Kamala is on a mission."
t3xqwAaatl8,I'm getting one of those hat's.
t3xqwAaatl8,He doesn’t care about 2A and he doesn’t care about guns. He cares about your vote. That’s all he ever cares about and that’s all he will ever care about.
t3xqwAaatl8,If he really cared about 2A he would be an expert.  Colion is correct.  Trump has many other priorities.  Hopefully he will get better advive in the future.
t3xqwAaatl8,Open border Biden is a reminder to check my ammo supplies. I have family on the southern border of Arizona. Fortunately the dad has a military background and is well armed.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Let me be clear.... For the Democrats....my first weapon assigned to me in the US Army was an M16A1-semi automatic and automatic, I carried an M16A1 with an M203 grenade launcher attachment, I have used the following...M249 SAW-squad automatic weapon, an M60, 7.62mm machine gun, an M2, .50 cal machine gun... these are WEAPONS OF WAR! An AR15 IS NOT A WEAPON OF WAR."
t3xqwAaatl8,Thank you!
t3xqwAaatl8,"Mr noir, very entertaining and informative. I agree with your stance on trump. I personally think wayne lapierre walked him off the cliff 
On bumpstocks. I don't think the nra is anywhere near back to supporting 2a. I should probably look into 1 of your hats, i identify as hardcore
Ammo sexual, reloaders are like that. If i run out of ammo I'm down  to swords clubs and a estwing ball-peen. Getting too old for that🤷‍♂️🧓"
t3xqwAaatl8,Your right. For some reason they refused to actually try to fix the issues.  Guns aren't the problem. And for some reason they are really trying so hard to strip us of our gun rights
t3xqwAaatl8,This video was incredibly terrible apologetics.
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump does not care about gun owners. If he gets elected he has zero incentive to defend the 2A.
t3xqwAaatl8,But it's not the gun its the lack of respect for life
t3xqwAaatl8,What does a dictator do? He disarms the civilian population.
t3xqwAaatl8,I’m liberal in just about every way. I’m not fan of Trump and I’m no fan of Republicans. I’m a huge 2nd amendment fan. I will be voting Trump because of the 2nd Amendment. I still lean left socially and economically in some ways but I can’t see myself voting for these anti-gun politicians anymore.
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump is a fraud.
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump is actually had concealed carry in New York for very long time .  Since he's felony convictions the NYPD has considered taking his concealed carry license from him.
t3xqwAaatl8,"I want one of your caps bad bro, but I just can't spend $28 for a cap.. 😔🧢"
t3xqwAaatl8,People really think Trump cares about guns? He only cares about himself.
t3xqwAaatl8,Thank you for sharing this information
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump is a big city democrate at heart, he is absolutely not a 2A advocate, that was clear in his first term when he made a statement against 2A rights then later had to walk it back because it pissed off his base so bad"
t3xqwAaatl8,"What did he say about 2A when he
was president. ?  R"
t3xqwAaatl8,"If guns are outlawed, only the Government will have them.   Outlaws are not the really the issue."
t3xqwAaatl8,"You forgot Trump's promise to back, *and execute into law the unconstitutional bill proposed by the Rhino, DAN CRENSHAW, namely ERPOS (a.k.a. Red Flag Law).*  I honestly don't think that Trump fully understood the extreme dangers in ERPOS (as there is in [Biden/Clinton's] VAWA).
I hope that Mr. Trump has a greater understanding, and the need for the  Second Amendment. I trust no politician, but a Harris/Cox regime will literally be the death of Freedom, The Creator's greatest gift to us."
t3xqwAaatl8,I thought battlefield weapons were sumn from a 2011 game
t3xqwAaatl8,It’s true. He speaks broadly and basically on this topic.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Remember, Trump actually does own a gun."
t3xqwAaatl8,"MOST politicians are ignorant to MANY issues important to their constituents that’s why they rely so heavily on us telling them what matters to us, that’s WHY they and companies put so much stock in social media when at the end of the day it’s such a small percentage of the population, these people are cut off from real life, it’s up to us to remind them what matters. When we don’t they make gut calls or they’re manipulated by the wrong people, it happens to everyone."
t3xqwAaatl8,"💯 you can be pro gun without being into guns, my dad was very pro gun his entire life and didn’t own one at any point in his life before he passed away, my mom still doesn’t own one and is the same now that he’s gone."
t3xqwAaatl8,Yes...this is what makes me skeptical about trump 2nd amendment  pro gun....and the braud talks of takeing the guns .....it makes me and I'm sure of  other law abiding citizens very skeptical...
t3xqwAaatl8,Well done
t3xqwAaatl8,I'm not nearly as confident as Mr. Noir is about trump protecting our 2nd amandment rights however I see no peaceful alternative at this point...
t3xqwAaatl8,"Some good points, but I still don't trust him. Trust no one."
t3xqwAaatl8,Yep... agree. He gets input from advisors.
t3xqwAaatl8,It's interesting that one would even have to ask if Trump is in favor of the second amendment. With Harris there is no question that she and the entire democrat party is against it.
t3xqwAaatl8,"My Trump is a member of the nra. 80,000,000 gun owner's vote Mr Trump save America from socialism"
t3xqwAaatl8,Vote for me im going to lift all gun restrictions
t3xqwAaatl8,Any man in power hates de seconf amendmen
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump is a  red flags man
t3xqwAaatl8,"If you even have to ask, that makes him way better than anyone on the left."
t3xqwAaatl8,"It’s a sad day to see you making excuses for Trump like the shill people accused you of being when you were still officially affiliated with the NRA. 

Funny how you conveniently ignore the part where Trump encouraged Dianne Feinstein to add her “assault weapons” ban to the school safety bill all while telling Steve Scalise to “forget about” national reciprocity. Also told Republicans to embrace the gun control and stop fearing the NRA.

Trump has been an anti-2A Democrat his whole life. The only time Trump has said pro-2A things are when he’s campaigning. Pushing gun control like “red flag” laws and bump stock bans was not a “mistake,” or him receiving “bad advice.” It was intentional betrayal. Trump reneged on virtually every campaign promise: supporting 2A, draining the swamp, releasing all the JFK files, prosecuting Hillary, etc. Trump has attempted to undermine the GOP and push them further left at every opportunity and has went after the most pro-2A Republicans like Thomas Massie. It’s a pattern of behavior that shows he is NOT even remotely on our side. He is here to sabotage us from within."
t3xqwAaatl8,Thanks for sharing your perspective
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump banned the bump stock because he is a RINO. He listened to Lapierre and the NRA. He doesnt understand the Constitution of the US and he WILL attack the second ammendment again. He selected the judge appointment because he was told to select those judges by Graham, McConnell and others on our side. Trump is only on Trumps side he doesnt give a flying fuck about you! He needs as many votes as he can get because I really cant see Trump winning when the other side will just steal the vote again."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Sure Donald Trump supports 2A, while he's campaigning...as long as his owners don't object."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Supreme court Justices, corrupt Gov`ts, Presidents have no say when it comes to our Constitution and the 2ND Amendment. Modern man even thinks he controls Mother Nature, it shows what fools many have become."
t3xqwAaatl8,If he is a second amendment supporter he is very likely having second thoughts after nearly getting assassinated
t3xqwAaatl8,"Politicians talking about guns is so cringe, it's very obvious they have not the slightest clue what they are reading off the paper. So fake, so disenginuous,  they shouldn't make rules for anybody, nobody should take them or their careers seriously. These people are a joke"
t3xqwAaatl8,I THINK TRUMP SHOULD PUT YOU IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!!
t3xqwAaatl8,He’s a gun grabber.  100%
t3xqwAaatl8,Actions speak louder than words. He still toke 2A rights away. Meaning he will do it again.
t3xqwAaatl8,I like your take on this one.
t3xqwAaatl8,I think Collon Noir should be Trump's new ATF director!
t3xqwAaatl8,People complain about Trump because of his bump stock ban... but he did put 3 SCOTUS judges on the bench who are staunch advocates of the 2A by virtue of following the constitution.  The next president will likely see Thomas and Alito retire.  So our pro2A 6-3 supreme court could become a 5-4 anti gun supreme court in the blink of an eye.  You will then see gun restrictions popping up all over the country.
t3xqwAaatl8,"There’s nothing you can tell me when Trump said himself that he’s taking the guns away and due process later. There’s nothing else to talk about I don’t understand how he has this much influence that his supporters are completely blinded by his own actions. He’s also said multiple things about banning suppressors, sbr’s, etc. why can’t we call bullshit where it’s bullshit"
t3xqwAaatl8,I'm supportive of the second amendment. I'm the most supportive person ever. I'm very very supportive...He is also supportive of red flag laws.
t3xqwAaatl8,The you know who made/let the Vegas event happen because they used it to stop national reciprocity from being signed. You know I’m speaking the truth because one of the first things they did was urge Trump not to sign it. And they got their wish.
t3xqwAaatl8,TRUMP 2024!!!!
t3xqwAaatl8,"So the moral of the story is :
“Vote for the ccsd rpst who uses rcst spiel to attract fllwrs, because protecting a right grntd by the cnstttn (and thus ntchbl as frequently argued) is more mprtnt than cvl rghts that aren’t protected by the cnstttn?”
(Sigh) why do I still come here…"
t3xqwAaatl8,EXCUSE me sir ....Colon can you just run for president i would totally vote for you ...the videos you post lead me to believe that you are in fact smarter than 99.9 percent of politicians  so just do it ty :)
t3xqwAaatl8,Trump is pro-gun but doesn't have a huge interest like his sons.
t3xqwAaatl8,Articulate...well spoken.
t3xqwAaatl8,"“Take guns then due process”, the worst part about that statement is that literally anyone can say you’re a danger to yourself or others, even if you’ve never done anything wrong in your life, and you’ll automatically get ostracized by people that don’t know you"
t3xqwAaatl8,"He didn't condemn the AR15,  because he realizes it not the gun.......
It's the Criminal holding it.  Guns don't fire by themselves, normally."
t3xqwAaatl8,"I don’t think it’s actually logical to give him a pass on backing the bump stock ban or anything else. He also said he “just doesn’t like silencers” when asked about banning them. Actions speak louder than words and his only 2A actions have been anti-2A.

In my mind we have two anti-2A candidates on the ballot."
t3xqwAaatl8,Get him on an interview
t3xqwAaatl8,"""Take the guns first, due process later."" Trump ain't for the 2nd amendment.

Trump is a joke in every conceivable way."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump put an anti gunner judge in the 9th circuit.

Trump pushed the ATF to ban bump stocks.

Trump did NOTHING to protect or advance the second amendment when he had a Republican majority in his first two years.

Trump and the GOP removed any mention of firearms or the second amendment in the 2024 GOP platform. 

Trump is a gun grabber."
t3xqwAaatl8,Trumps not a gun guy. He likes golf clubs. He’s great on the constitution however. And the second amendment is right after the first. So yeah. Were all safe
t3xqwAaatl8,You used the term “harmless compromise”… there is NO SUCH THING!!!! Especially when it comes to our 2A rights!!!
t3xqwAaatl8,"No,hje does not, but what choice do we have."
t3xqwAaatl8,The fact that he thought it was OK to suspend Due Process is much more worrying than not being a gun guy IMHO.
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump is not pro-2A. He just knows that his base is pro gun. He panders like every politician, but at least he’s on the right side of the issue."
t3xqwAaatl8,"There should be law about makeing gun laws and the person must have enough knowledge and experience in guns just like in every field they ask ur resume, experience and knowledge so the person they hire give the best output.."
t3xqwAaatl8,He's the only president still around that has been shot but still supports the 2A
t3xqwAaatl8,"How can he? It's out of his purview being a convicted felon. That takes him out of the equation. I'm for something, I can't legally own! Doesn't that just sound silly?"
t3xqwAaatl8,"You cannot turn your semi auto into full auto with a bump stock. 😂
They’re identifying your semi auto as auto cuz of your bump stock.
It’s same as a man identified himself as a woman cuz he put on a bra and a dress. 😂"
t3xqwAaatl8,How can a felon support something if he cant even legally hold one?
t3xqwAaatl8,"The Second Amendment is an insurance policy designed to protect citizens from tyranny, rooted in the Founding Fathers’ experiences in the late 1700s. It preserves the right of an armed citizenry—acting as a militia, whether organized or not—to defend against threats to liberty, ensuring that power remains with the people. While societal changes and legal precedents may evolve, the core purpose of the Second Amendment remains constant: to safeguard the enduring freedom of America from potential tyranny, resisting any attempts to diminish this essential right. We only need to look back for an example of this as recently as the Battle of Athens (Tennessee, 1946)."
t3xqwAaatl8,"Trump makin an add takin machine gun and just hipfiring it like rambo at a bunch of boxes with dumb biden administration laws passed while hes drippy with sweat, a eagle flys by and a AR 15 earpiercing and he gucci to be the #1 maga agaib"
t3xqwAaatl8,NO
t3xqwAaatl8,The amount of copium in this video is crazy. You talk about this like you were one of his personal advisors during these missteps and shitshows he started
t3xqwAaatl8,"its pretty obvious the bump stock ban was put through by trump for optics to appease the fence sitters, because his TEAM knew it wouldn't pass in the courts. trump may not be super educated on it, but he has team members that have their fingers on the pulse. strategic move to grab some fence sitters that would blow left with a slight breeze."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"What else would you expect for an untrustworthy mainstream media. Nothing but lies from the actual people who have provided hatred, racism, bigotry, misinformation, misrepresentation, false narratives, and propaganda."
tZJ9twIw_ns,CNN still scuks ars use to be a great company
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) flippantly tweeted that gun owners that would dare consider opposing a tyrannical government attempting to seize their lawfully-owned firearms would face a “short war” because “the government has nukes too.” 
This isn't the first time a democrat politician threatened Americans, even President Biden said AR's are useless against F16's. Is this just Sticks and Stones, or very real threats."
tZJ9twIw_ns,How about the dem(ons) trying to assassinate Trump in real time ??????????
tZJ9twIw_ns,Download trump and say that they did pulled them accountable
tZJ9twIw_ns,I heard that Biden is moving warships into the Middle East and doing maneuvers. I think they’re going to try and get us into a war before the election is over so that they stay in power they’re willing to kill our children to stay in power I just cannot comprehend evilness of the Democrat party at this point.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"It's obvious when he says ""Lets put her with a rifle..."" that he is talking about putting her in the place of U.S. soldiers faceing the barrels of enemies to see how much of a warhawk she would be under those circumstances. That's not even close to saying she should be shot."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Why are Dems and their media sycophants suddenly so in love with ANYONE surnamed Cheney?  Must be TDS!  😂
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Typical hypocraptic tactics of the corrupt, complicit FAKE NEWS MEDIA...  The ""4 D's: DECEIVE, DIVIDE, DENY & DELAY!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,This and other flagrant occurrences is exactly why the leftist media is void of credibility to a large percentage of red blooded Americans. Trust in anything CNN says is absolutely zero.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Hope I don’t get censored and blocked for my freedom of speech.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Liz Cheney...don't get me started.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"DECEPTIVE   EDITING   TACTICS   EMPLOYED   TO   ALTER  /  TWIST  ONES   COMPLETE   FACTUAL   STATEMENTS   MADE  .

tZJ9twIw_ns,The left has called for the death of Trump many times but the moment Trump says anything that has those keywords they say he is calling for it and it is not okay.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"I saw this, and it’s disgusting. The media needs to be shut down for such delusion and slander against Trump! What we need to be worrying about is what we’re going to do once kamala steals the election with fraudulent votes."
tZJ9twIw_ns,THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT SHOULD LEAD TO A DEFAMATION LAWSUIT (MAD EMOJI)
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Come on, the media doesn't spread misinformation.  Only Republicans spread misinformation."
tZJ9twIw_ns,It is sad that supposedly intelligent people will fall for this BS
tZJ9twIw_ns,The left will try anything to stop progress.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Why do we pay attention to these idiots? what do you feed a "" warhawk"" ?"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Yet they want people to do bad things to Trump .
tZJ9twIw_ns,Everything they say is a lie. They are reprobates
tZJ9twIw_ns,The American people aren’t that stupid!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,CNN is a joke!! 🤪🤪🤡🤡
tZJ9twIw_ns,TRUMP ALL THE WAY!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,"In the past week, the left had the opportunity to shine a light on Puerto Rico’s landfill issue, and helping the island’s people. They threw that opportunity in the garbage, in favor of perpetuating a lie to say Orange Man Bad. 
In the past week, the left had the perfect opportunity to find common ground, and argue for peace and fewer of our suns and daughters being sent to fight and die on foreign soil. They threw that opportunity in the garbage, in favor of perpetuating a lie to say Orange Man Bad. That is F***ED UP."
tZJ9twIw_ns,So does that mean CNN supports a Dem saying potential trump shooters should get firearms training and practice? Or that means let her go to the blue bastions and walk the same streets that we do or the fact she votes for war and let her go to the battle lines of war.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Just voted TRUMP/ VANCE literally twenty five minutes ago , TRUMP/VANCE AND REPUBLICAN ALL THE WAY!!!!! MAGA PERIOD, FCK THE COMMUNIST LEFT!!!!!!!!!!!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Sadly, there are morons out there who will believe this, no matter what  the truth really is"
tZJ9twIw_ns,That’s all they do is lie everything they say when they open their mouth is a lie or they’re projecting it on to Donald Trump. The American people know exactly what those idiots are doing except for the stupid ones to vote for them.
tZJ9twIw_ns,He basically saying if your such hurry to fight a war Then you go out and fight it first yourself and find out what a war is.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"My , these communist assholes are complete lunatics"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Desperate sick people...democrats...oh my..
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Sure, it evokes that image. If you're either dumber than a bag of hammers, or a liar. Or like them, both."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Trump said the same stuff Ozzy Osborne sang about in the Black Sabbath song 'War Pigs'
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor, yeah
As cool as Trump is, no doubt he banged his head to some Sabbath back in his day."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Come on. We all know the ridiculousness that Trump is capable of. He shoots from the mouth, his flying monkeys do the deed."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Make MSM news reporting again.  Nah, just get them off the air.  I get my news from the boots on the ground folks, like Braden.  They have never lied to me about what is really happening."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Like anything is new from the Communist News Network!
tZJ9twIw_ns,"So he is talking against what is being done by the Dems, so they turn around and say he wants to do it? Do I have that part right? Propaganda at it's finest and too many sheeple don't even listen to the clip, read Ground News (I do+) or any other media. It is Click Bait and out of the gate! I'd sue for slander. This is ridiculous and dangerous, but the pundits know it. VOTE!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"The Globalist/Communist controlled News Network's  like CNN, MSNBC, ABC,  CBS, stink and should be shut down for the MISINFORMATION they report. CNN should be sued for slander by altering what was said by President Trump actually said to fit the lie they want to report to make him look bad. This is why I listen to independent news, and stopped watching these LAME-STREAM news channels because they  are the ones reporting MISINFORMATION."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"I think that CNN, is a competitor to The Cartoon Network, and The Cartoon Network does a better job."
tZJ9twIw_ns,The U.N. is pulling out all the stops.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"He said ""lets give her a gun "" you don't give somebody to execution with a gun to defend themselves 
She is to be sent to the front lines"
tZJ9twIw_ns,And Crickets about the Democrats incentivizeing 2 attempts to kill Trump. Nothing said about his plane now mysteriously developing problems. Really CNN. Hmm. You really are Communist Network News.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Fun fact, if a democrat's lips are moving, they are LYING!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"They can't win if they don't lie!!! It's LIES, not propaganda!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Who makes the most money if we are at war?
tZJ9twIw_ns,The main media are idiots
tZJ9twIw_ns,He said put her there with a rifle and having others shooting at her! Get it right. God bless
tZJ9twIw_ns,They chop and cut and leave out the words.  Scumbags
tZJ9twIw_ns,"He was saying that She was a War Hawk , and would She be Brave enough to put Her self in the path live fire facing down the barrel's, as She does to our troops  !"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"The left is desperate now. Everything they have done so far to keep Trump from being President has failed.  Even attempted murder, so they have nothing to lose... EXCEPT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Every dem ad I've seen this year has been manipulated so badly as to be nothing but lies.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Unbecoming of a leader huh, wasn’t it Obama that said we are bitter and clinging to our religion and guns. Wasn’t it Hillary that called us all deplorable and didn’t Biden just call us garbage. I didn’t hear Trump or any other Republican call people names simply for voting for a Democrat"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Did you miss him saying put a rifle in her hands? Sounds more like he is talking about her going in herself.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Thank you Mr. Langley for being a respectable representative of the right.  Many are BEING PRIMED to fight on BOTH SIDES.  Cooler heads will prevail.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"And these are the people who actually called for “a ministry of truth” kind of ironic, wouldn’t you say?"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Media lies again
tZJ9twIw_ns,The SWAMP would commit a crime on one of their own to blame Trump .
tZJ9twIw_ns,"If Trump wanted Liz to be shot, he would just tell her to go on a hunting trip with her dad."
tZJ9twIw_ns,We are dealing with extremely evil people.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Hmmm, executing your political opponents? Trump? I think it is more like the Dems trying to execute their opponent, after all Trump has already had 2 attempts at his life!!!!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,The Democratics and lieing Media people wake up please !!!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,"funny since its leftists openly calling for violence on Trump that got him shot for real. Hope they have their passports ready as only know 2 dem voters to 23 trump votes. We already voted so done already, so its up to you. GARBAGE! ASSEMBLE!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Not shocked at all that the MSM would alter something that Trump said to fit their narrative.
tZJ9twIw_ns,More of a reason to vote RED
tZJ9twIw_ns,These people are so intellectually dishonest. How can they even look in a mirror.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Sue the sht out of them all
tZJ9twIw_ns,David Muir pushed this false narrative on the National ABC News tonight.
tZJ9twIw_ns,I have said this! I think before ANY POLITICIAN votes to send American troops to fight on foreign soil they should be required to insure members of THEIR families goes FIRST!
tZJ9twIw_ns,I was lucky enough to have served under Reagan.
tZJ9twIw_ns,The left has zero idea how close they are to being totally irrelevant
tZJ9twIw_ns,1:25  hold that thought
tZJ9twIw_ns,So basically mainstream media is alluding that Liz Cheney should go hunting with her father?
tZJ9twIw_ns,🐸✝️
tZJ9twIw_ns,Context is everything.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Even though it wouldn’t be the worst thing…
tZJ9twIw_ns,Media yall about to go to jail!!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,And exactly how many of those clowns have spent any time on a battlefield such as Donald Trump describes.  Or walked through the war zone of any Democratic city without a gaggle of armed bodyguards. I'm willing to bet none of them have been anywhere near the pointy end of the stick.  Keep up the good work Braden.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"If Trump really wants to do that, he'd pick up millions more votes!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"""Spirit of"" Aloha from the 9th circus 🎪"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"I remember a few weeks ago they showed all the liberal democrats talking about taking Trump out, there were almost a dozen, why doesn't someone run that video again to show the dems all's fair in love and war."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Sounds like a defamation lawsuit to me 💰
tZJ9twIw_ns,😮
tZJ9twIw_ns,Peace sells but who's buying?🤘😎
tZJ9twIw_ns,And these same people were trying to put Donald away for 170 years
tZJ9twIw_ns,Draft The representatives into every conflict they vote yes to.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Want to bet that Liz inherited her daddy's stock holdings in the military industrial complex.?
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Honestly if you haven't learned by now that these people are paid liars, I don't see any hope for you."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"It’s so stupid, she would stop sending kids to war if she knew what it was like"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"FU-YT (Removed my comment)
""9 People in a Firing Squad!"" this phrase is focused on ignorant/stupid people. Anyone that knows anything about firing squads knows that there are 5 rifles, 5 shooters,4 bullets and one blank. (At least in the U.S, its different in other nations... looking at you Thailand) But, to even suggest that this was what he said is just flat out Libal. They are printing something that is knowingly false and not mistakable in the slightest.  ""Get off your Fat ASS Hillary, Their Spewing ""Propaganda"" and ""Fake News"". Why aren't you out there fighting the good fight that ""You Believe In So Much"". 
Oh Yeah, The Democratic party is about as worthless as a bag of dead and rotting Cats.... actually, at least the bag of dead and rotting cats could attract some Catfish... Which is exactly what you get when you read or listen to a CNN story... Catfished!!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"They started the fact check thing, but their so stupid they believe we won't fact check them. Main stream media is the scum of the earth, lower than snail slime. Screw them, boycott them, find them on the street, and let them know what they are.
As we well know, if the liberal left didn't have lies, they'd have nothing to say."
tZJ9twIw_ns,You absolutely can't believe ANYTHING the MSM says! It's amazing how they lie and manipulate what is said.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Trumps the only 1
tZJ9twIw_ns,"""Seems to me, i heard the 'Apostrophe'!"" ROTF"
tZJ9twIw_ns,My Mom called me today to tell me that Trump said we should shoot Liz. I told her I'd look it up and find out what he said because that would be crazy for him to say and I didn't believe it. Thank you Langley Outdoors Academy.
tZJ9twIw_ns,No one believes anything out of there mouth
tZJ9twIw_ns,The left is so delusional
tZJ9twIw_ns,These people have to be held criminally accountable.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"CNN is well known for making things up we all know that.
This manipulation of what was said shows how desperate CNN and the left really are.
Check out the body language of Kasie Hunt she is petrified."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Hopefully in 4 years when JD Vance runs for president he has Don Jr as his running mate
tZJ9twIw_ns,And they call us garbage?
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Why is it that every time the left says Trump, every word after that sounds like Charley Brown’s teacher talking.😂"
tZJ9twIw_ns,They are nothing but propaganda. They don’t like Trump so they think it’s okay to be deceptive. They are not journalists in the media anymore.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Propaganda is the only way left for CNN
tZJ9twIw_ns,They just keep on trying.   SMH
tZJ9twIw_ns,"All those involved with this clip should be put in prison for Election Interference, Slander, Instigating Civil Unrest, Deliberate Division and Harm to the Citizens,... and finally,... yet further attempts to create/instigate Violence against President Trump's Life and all of his supporters. ALL OF THEM!!!
This is Criminal!!! Lacks Morals, Integrity and Conscience!!! 
Democrat Media/State Media/Main Stream Media *MUST BE STOPPED!!!* They're literally and deliberately attacking the very fiber of Our Country!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Black sabbath already called it out...War Pigs
tZJ9twIw_ns,Time to fire fake news.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"CNN needs their plug pulled, their propaganda is trash."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"The media has lied to us!!!
Gasp says one responder.
Egads cries another.
A third just outright fainted.
Also, in other news, h2o is moist."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"He's suing CBS, CNN will be next."
tZJ9twIw_ns,What I heard President Trump say is:  PUT the XX RINO WARHAWK in a dangerous situation that the XX has put American People who are sent into a WAR ZONE!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,Interesting! I guess it is just fine for Joe Biden's rhetoric about having someone put a target on Trump causing 2 ass-clowns to take shots at Trump.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"As the White House STENOGRAPHERS have REVIELED;  the ""social propagandists"" of the White House are WILLING to ALTER the FACTS that are released to the American Citizens / WE THE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,These people are vile war mongers. Great program. Subscribed!! 🙋🇺🇸❤️💙🤍
tZJ9twIw_ns,media flat out lying    as usual
tZJ9twIw_ns,"DICK cheney is the real monster, his evil daughter is just running panicked cover."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Let's put it this way her father Dick Cheney he is as far as I'm concerned a war criminal and his daughter is not any better they're both evil and don't care about the people in this country whatsoever start doing little research read into it family because things are going to really surprise you
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Lets have hell freeze over when papa trump gets in office, the administration is about to have a hell of a time"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"THE LIGHTS ARE COMING ON, MONSTERS!!!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Did you ever go in to a roach infested structure and turn on the lights?... Well we are all about to see.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Loser Democrats
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Firing squads are traditionally made up of 7 members, not 9. And of course, the condemned doesn't get a rifle to shoot back with."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Thx LOA  🙏🇺🇸Trump/Vance🇺🇸🙏
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Hey Breydan, They are projecting personal fears knowing that they are guilty of crimes, they knew carried a death penalty before they got caught.
And yes after all they have done to #45/47.  Now the tide is swinging from the hand of GOD.🇺🇸😝"
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Theyr not stupid, they know what theyr doing.. They are responsible"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Liz Cheney is part of a generational family of military industrial complex war mongering monsters
tZJ9twIw_ns,"This is crazy
They always take a word or two and spin it.
I’m not a video editor but someone who can should make a playlist of short…from blood bath, the tossing fish food when in Japan, this Chaney, their so called riot that end in hours at the capital building"
tZJ9twIw_ns,You know Trump was just trying to describe the soldiers plight fear of death at all times. He feels bad for those soldiers who hate seeing them killed.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"The left dont have a problem with Biden saying put Trump in crosshairs, then he got shot , they are desperate morons"
tZJ9twIw_ns,CNN now that's real journalism OMG Trump SHOULD sue seriously
tZJ9twIw_ns,There was a  time in history when those who pushed for war had skin in the game. It was their children who were going to fight and possibly die. That time has past. The hawks today are not risking anything. They are merely spending the lives of other peoples children for their own gain. It's truly disgusting.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"At this point, just ignore them completely.  They shouldn't even be shown on conservative channels anymore.  They can be propaganda for their own echo chambers.  Just don't look, just don't look!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,It's all the media has is paid lies
tZJ9twIw_ns,Fuel
tZJ9twIw_ns,Jonah Goldberg who was speaking in the first clip has come out and said his comments were wrong and made in haste. Also jake Tapper at CNN has said that Trumps comments have been taken out of context.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"It's not an execution by firing squad if ""she  has a gun"" facing 9 guns facing her. Listen close to Trump words.  CNN does say that...."
tZJ9twIw_ns,CNN should be cancelled due to all their lies.  Corrupt News Network.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"dems kama r so despirate to win because they r n peril f trump wins - so many 
cnn msnbc abc cbs - lies a lot - cannot b trusted ..."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Looking for an excuse not to certify the election if Trump wins.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"I think it's called ""deflecting.""  THEY made a similar statement about Trump and a nutcase took them literally and SHOT AT TRUMP, so of course they have to advise him if doing what THEY did🙄"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Sue them Prez Trump !!!!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,CNN=> Chinese News Network!!! What more can I say?!?
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Why are none of these lefties complaining about all of the calls for shooting or otherwise inflicting violence on D. Trump, including these very people?"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Never full context by media
tZJ9twIw_ns,Only when I think the media can't get any lower they prove me wrong once again.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Anybody that believes that is simply an idiot.
tZJ9twIw_ns,THAT IS OUT AND OUT SLANDER!!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,Sue cnn
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Dude, im already voting for him. stop trying to sell it with catchy titles"
tZJ9twIw_ns,Democratic Party  Propaganda
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Seems like a distraction over the DOD authorizing military to use deadly force on US citizens Trump has been shot at, Trump has been prosecuted by this administration.  Seeking  justice isn't  revenge,  just justice."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Just send Liz on a hunting trip with Dick Cheney.
tZJ9twIw_ns,I do not think so but she is a trator 😅and a cry baby whaaaaaaa 😅clown 🤡
tZJ9twIw_ns,Unfortunately MSM will make sure this lie goes viral. They are desperate now.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"This is retaliation for Bidens comment about Trump supporters being garbage and they altered his statement but got caught, Vote Trump and Republican straight across the board. 
Democrats will never overthrow the constitution, and let me tell you they are trying."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Since when do you have to put 9 barrels up as a firing squad 😅😂😊😅
tZJ9twIw_ns,Every single one of these people should be sued until they are left to pan-handling!
tZJ9twIw_ns,FCC should review CNN license to broad cast after Trump gets sworn in.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"They picked the wrong fight as per usual. Trump didn't call for her to be shot. However, after what she did with J6, I would imagine those whose lives were ruined by Liz and her committee wouldn't lose aby sleep if it happened to her."
tZJ9twIw_ns,trump over the hump.
tZJ9twIw_ns,He needs to sue the shit out of them
tZJ9twIw_ns,Thank you
tZJ9twIw_ns,That's all they're good at is lying boy?Will we all be better off when they're gone and we're back in power
tZJ9twIw_ns,First He said she could have a rifle too fight against 9 other folks shooting at her.
tZJ9twIw_ns,these very same people were ticked that the teenaged boy missed. they need to shut their pie holes.
tZJ9twIw_ns,It’s amazing how stupid these people really are.
tZJ9twIw_ns,The left are doing what they do best LIE!!!!!!
tZJ9twIw_ns,Lier 🤥thanks lord everyone now  can see the truth Americans wake up this media is worst then Biden garbage 🗑️
tZJ9twIw_ns,"well, that's cnn, commie news network."
tZJ9twIw_ns,BOTH OF THE POLICE ACTIONS IN KOREA AND VIETNAM WERE RUN BY THE WAR HAWKS OF CONGRESS THEY WERE NOT DECLARED A WAR . IF IT WAS DECLARED WAR THE GENERAL'S WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF WHAT GOING ON NOT SOME PIN HEAD IN WASHINGTON D.C WHO HAS NO IDEA OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Just another commie democrat party lying in a propaganda video!   CNN is the Communist News Network!!!!
Don’t believe anything they say!!!!"
tZJ9twIw_ns,CNN does not comprehend the  English language well. They always come with flawed interpretation when it comes to President Trump.
tZJ9twIw_ns,U tube is going to block me for 24 hours. Violating my first amendment right.  TRAITORS..
tZJ9twIw_ns,"😂So they are showing  the  untrue comments and then they expect to be considered a important news network 🙄 really  Brandon's Really that  desperate are you, to not report the truth 🤔"
tZJ9twIw_ns,I think Clinton News Network spread some disinformation crap about Mark Robinson in NC
tZJ9twIw_ns,I would sue them for enough to put them out of business.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"The people that twist this information should be fired immediately. Thats what’s wrong with the media, the truth never gets told, unless its preached to the choir."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Trump is right about Cheney. She's a warhawk just like her dad. How many millions did Dick Cheney earn from Haliburton during the Gulf Wars. As vice president he had access to and owned stock in that company. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree with that family. It wouldn't surprise me if she owned stock in it as well, or another company that would stand to benefit from constantly being at war. Line their own frickin pockets and don't care about the lives of the people who do the fighting."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"CNN
Communist News Network
Need i say more?
Other than the one that's worse than CNN.
MSNBC"
tZJ9twIw_ns,People hear. But. They don’t listen. And. These communist news networks twist the truth and lie by taking the story out of context. They twist everything to fit their narrative.
tZJ9twIw_ns,Liberalism is a Mental illness.
tZJ9twIw_ns,He didn’t say it but most of us think it should happen and won’t say it.
tZJ9twIw_ns,No surprise from these communists
tZJ9twIw_ns,Democrats make money when we're at war and after 55000 Americans die they go and say let's  be against the war and call American soldiers baby killers like they did to our returning soldiers from Vietnam.
tZJ9twIw_ns,They always lie to us.  They will never be honest.
tZJ9twIw_ns,"I was at this event, the second he said this I texted my mom (she was live streaming from her home), and I said “the mainstream media is going to take that quote and warp it tomorrow” 
And here we are. 😹😹😹😹"
tZJ9twIw_ns,All news agencies should be shutdown because they NEVER report the news... only what their agendas are!
tZJ9twIw_ns,Sue for slander
tZJ9twIw_ns,"CNN - con national news, this is what to expect."
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Can you imagine what it feels like to put on these Charades, Knowing they are lying as they do it."
tZJ9twIw_ns,This is some of the worst propaganda that I have seen since the prostitutes peed on his bed in Russia. If this is really what they heard him say in full context then the news is pretty much done. We can’t trust them to protect us with accurate information.
tZJ9twIw_ns,They will never stop they have been at him since 2015 will any of their back stabbing ever come back to haunt them??????????
tZJ9twIw_ns,More Law Suits for Trump to Win...Get em Trump...
tZJ9twIw_ns,All of those propaganda outlets put out crap like that. I guess they don’t think people have enough sense to see what DJT said about Liz Cheney ourselves! We know what he said and he didn’t say what CNN said he did. Liars 🤥 and FAKE NEWS! 🐂 💩 outlets!
tZJ9twIw_ns,"they have been caught so many times for dubbing clips and editing splices together, they never learn due to the fact some individuals still believe they report the truth as if they filmed it with out an edit.    Wow dumb can you continue to be, apparently quit a bit."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Why can’t you read the title when you press more
tZJ9twIw_ns,"Total BS by the corrupt, lying media! Vote for Trump/Vance...we did, and we're happy we did."
tZJ9twIw_ns,Defamation
CxA3mLuwzp8,"For the umpteenth time, cognitive decline is NOT a normal part of aging. But the longer you live with cognitive decline the worse it gets. Dementia is degenerative. Biden can still make perfect sense and function as the President of the United. Look at the economy, the
jobs that have been created. And much more. Donald Trump can’t even speak in public without making all of us ask what the hell he’s even talking about. Sharks and batteries?  And he’ll be the President?  Haitians eating dogs and cats?  Come ON!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"That 40 minutes of Trump dancing that EVERYONE is poling on was the result of someone being taken ill and so he was just filling time and entertaining is rallygoers. So, that dog didn't hunt at all. Fun to watch folks try to Biden the hell out of that thing. People who know, know, already. Fun to watch the attempt to make fun of Trump's dancing when they wouldn't ever address Joe Biden's tinman lost in the woods behavior. Entertaining and amusing!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"What’s wrong with someone who is right? What’s wrong with the elites who are comically ignorant of what the “common people” think about their frantic efforts to be relevant😂😂posted after the landslide victory of the deplorable party over the, well, you know who,the rest of them."
CxA3mLuwzp8,God is what’s wrong with Trump.
CxA3mLuwzp8,He's insane!!
CxA3mLuwzp8,Ezra youve driven me to cancel my NY Times subscription. Again.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Dictators and mobsters love opera.

Leonard Cohen and Sinead oConnor want their songs and soul back again!!!

NY Times made Trump. It's It's ny Times fault for covering Trump. Ny times supported and encouraged the Entertainment. It's a stand-up going blue. Ny Times editorial board bullying Biden to drop out is where this hell began. Biden is doing the job!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,We all think once Trump has served his 4 years he will go away but that is not true his corrupt family will step in
CxA3mLuwzp8,His son Baron will carry on the family tradition once Trump has full on dementia
CxA3mLuwzp8,His son Baron will carry on the family tradition once Trump has full on dementia
CxA3mLuwzp8,His mom and Father damaged him
CxA3mLuwzp8,A 78-year old child-dictator!111
CxA3mLuwzp8,"NY TIMES helped to but him in the presidency.  WHY FOR GODS SAKE?  No one RANG THE ALARM BELLS that he was Deranged, demented, AND NEVER CALLED HIM OUT."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"This insane person bought the presidency of the 2024.   Trump, Musk, and all accomplices belong cuffed as Traitors and hauled off to prison."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Everything but people did not want to see. Trump is using dictator's tactics  telling people the that country having problems and that he going to fix them. Well, the country does not have problems and if it would have, Trump will not fixe them, he just wanted to get elected."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"There is nothing ""electric"" about Trump.  He's the little kid shouting ""F---!"" in the middle of a church service.  He is an overgrown child who never received discipline, who never had anyone say ""No"" to him, and who never learned how to wait.  He was a dysfunctional child.  That's why his parents sent him to a military high school.  But nothing changed inside him.  Now, he's a dysfunctional adult, and for some reason the American electorate put him in charge of the federal government."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Dr Bandi Lee and several other highly qualified mental health professionals hedl a conference a month or so before the election to educate the american public on the dangers of trump's derangements. Nobody listened . Certainly not the fuck8ng NTY who failed to report  anything about the broken brain of the republicans candidate.  They WERE WELL AWARE OF HIS MENTAL FRAGILITY,  BUT KEPT SHTUM. it sells papers, views etc now , doesnt it? He's a cash cow to the msm, and they're gonna milk him for all hes worth.( which isnt much)"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Honestly, if there are so many problems with Trump, why do the mainstream media need to lie or make things up about him? You habitually lied about him, so what makes you think this piece is anymore than the truth?"
CxA3mLuwzp8,What a tragedy that an entire nation has to suffer from one man's delusions and mental illness.
CxA3mLuwzp8,He bought the presidency.
CxA3mLuwzp8,not trumps age just republucan word salad used by many in his demented clan who are much younger than dirty  donald
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Trump and JD Vance have the coldest spookiest and most maniacal eyes I have seen.     The Eyes Do Not Lie - - They Ooze Aggression and Smug Calculation - - Like Rumsfeld .     It is upsetting to see people of ""faith"" tout Vance / Trump as destined - chosen =   Never in Modern History Has The Need to Protect Our Own Hearts and Minds Been of Such Paramount Importance.   Thank you for speaking reason and calling the Black Souls of These Men Out for What It Is - -  Millions are Holding The Doors Open For These Tyrants with Fancy Suits and Huge Egos Like MUSK.   Apalling and Dissociative To See This Kind Of Mockery Of Representation Pass for an ELECTION in the USA in 2024."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump started off calling out truths and then he just started making up his own. He's got lost in his own lies and I feel that's where his real instability lies.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"People didn’t vote for Trump. they voted against a crazy woke, leftist, party in the Democrats. A party that doesn’t see anything wrong with men competing in women’s sports, a party that wants to pick winners and losers based on skin color — whose candidate was picked solely on gender and skin color and who was woefully ill equipped for office.  Sure Trump tried to steal a lost election,. That was horrible.  And Dems are trying to shut down free speech under the guise of misinformation. they’d rather cancel you than grant you your right to an opinion.  Come back from outer space if you want to win the next election."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Out of touch insulated bubble people that keep talking between themselves🤣🤣🤣🤣 a slam dunk on the MM. though they get to having something to talk about, your rating might finally move lol"
CxA3mLuwzp8,12:15 this is the only true thing ive ever heard trump say
CxA3mLuwzp8,You left out so much information in this pod cast! You people never let up on this man! When serving his four years in office he was abused by the democrats and the main stream media! The stupidity of callling him Hitler was way over the top!!! I would say having Biden in office with his mind going was dangerous !your analysis is missing to many facts!!!!!!!!
CxA3mLuwzp8,"IT'S A FACT RACIST RAPISTS, FRAUDSTER FELONS, HATES SPEWING ADULTERERS, GRIFTING RACKETEERS, CAN POSSESS BAD & GOOD QUALITIES.  🤔"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"""He cannot control himself."" And now that he has been given unimaginable power, he still won't.  Winning has added fuel to the fire.  God help us.  And editing to add that this analysis received only 11k likes out of 363k views ... I am once again dumbfounded.  I just do not understand this world."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Thanks, Ezra."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Call it confirmation bias, but this - THIS - is why I refuse to listen to people saying that all the wailing and moaning and gnashing of teeth is unjustified - over-reaction - it couldn't possibly be all THAT bad - America isn't REALLY in danger. Wrong. Categorically and indisputably WRONG."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"America has spoken.  Trump47.
Your dem candidate was terrible."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"This aged like milk. It all might be true - but none of it mattered, did it?"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Apparently we really have an idiot contingent, and an asshole contingent, large enough to comprise a Republican supermajority. At this point, there is no one who can claim that a) they themselves are mentally competent and b) so is Trump. Well, they can claim it all day long, and couldn't produce any supporting evidence for both propositions (or, often, either one.) Slashing the education budget worked so good, no wonder they want to get rid of the Department of Education.Since I'm no longer twelve years old, I've changed my position on that issue. Many of you seem to have been left behind in Never-Never Land. Which, we may be about to be reminded, isn't a real place 🧭 I would also second all those who pointed out that this is way too little, way too late, Gray Bag Lady. Not that there isn't plenty of blame to go around. 🤬"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Congratulations.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I think the inhibition you're talking about, the ""software"" that assesses possible responses, one of its functions is to assess truthfullness.

It is not that inhibited people never lie, but they tell considered lies for some motivation or reason.

Trump lies are often strange and pointless"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump  deserved  the win   he workied his ass off
CxA3mLuwzp8,I'm in such a fucking bubble. I was listening to Kiasmos right before this video. I cackled when it got a mention.
CxA3mLuwzp8,Didn’t make himself either rich (that was inherited from his father)  or famous (that was done by the team which developed ‘The Apprentice’) but he has had the arrogance and entitlement to convince millions that he had done both.
CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump is eccentric. Biden is on the way to senility. There's is still and energy in Trump that Biden is losing before our eyes.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Ezra, I can appreciate that you are trying to be reserved and measured about Trump in a sea of shrill screaming, but it reflects the problem and absolute disgust that I have with the media in general: it's covered with such a dispassionate, detached air. You almost sound admiring of some of the worst characteristics a person can have. In trying to be clinical, you downplay the danger that others have suffered, and will suffer again or more intensely now. Sometimes the answer doesn't lie in the middle. Maybe the media needs to share in some of that shrill screaming. The danger is very real, and very much felt. I like your writing generally, but  sorry, you borked this one."
CxA3mLuwzp8,The nation absolutely wants Trump
CxA3mLuwzp8,Ezra trying to justify his shitty perspective on DT ….normalizing the abnormal and dangerous !! Your fired!!
CxA3mLuwzp8,Is Ezra Klein a fascist??? 🤔
CxA3mLuwzp8,"""how often have you been insulted or wronged by someone and wanted to just unload on them in public - to go all out in annihilating your tormentor any way you could?"".... Um. Never? Maybe that is the difference right there. Maybe half of us just don't have any internal desire to cause someone harm, even if harmed ourselves. Maybe that is why someone who would do that is so incomprehensible...and reprehensible.... to so many of us."
CxA3mLuwzp8,11:15. There IS nothing right with donald trump.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"This is by far one of the best episodes Ive heard from you (not suggesting others were bad). While I am not a Trump supporter, I am a lover of logic and reason, so providing an analysis absent of name calling and political bias, whether one agrees with that analysis or not, was great.  Nice job."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"He's a narcissistic sociopath, that IS what is wrong with Trump and he has been his whole life"
CxA3mLuwzp8,I have watched interview after interview of J.D. Vance and there is nothing in that man that says bootlicker. It makes me more comfortable that he's there.
CxA3mLuwzp8,Excellent Ezra !
CxA3mLuwzp8,Magnetic  & compelling ? 😂
CxA3mLuwzp8,"This is one of the best analyisis I have heard recently well balanced and thoughful. I have been facinated by this man. In a way its like pulling the wings off a fly finding out how he will react next. Thank you from an old girl who taught people with learning disabilities livinging europe.  I cannot like him he, gives me the creeps. God help poor America if he becomes president for he  is a most dangerous man. We on this side of the pond are very worried."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Of course Ezra listens to kiasmos
CxA3mLuwzp8,“The American Empire is coming to an end. This moment in history marks the end of a long sad tale of greed and murder by the White Races. It is inevitable that by the final show we vomited up a figure like Trump.” —Chris Hedges.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"The only reason the lower, working, and middle classes in Americans vote for Trump is because he looks like them. They think Trump is one of them because he looks ugly, ignorant, arrogant, cruel, a junk-food lover, and an unrefined street-slang speaker. “He looks like one of us!” the average uneducated Americans think. That’s how they manage to trick all of them."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"The Republican Party, the billionaires bribing politicians and Project 2025 have brought the US back to the Dark Ages. MAGA is a Dark Ages populace: a bunch of ignorant, mad, cult-minded, racist people."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Trump is making people believe the 2024 election will be rigged against him. This was his trick in 2020 and this is his trick again. Wake the fuck* up, America!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!... Lock Trump up!...
CxA3mLuwzp8,Thanks.  Both insightful as to the linkage betwee6 Trumps appeal and his pathology and an astute summery of why we face a disaster if Trump is returned to power
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I have always thought you were honest and insightful. To say that Trump did no harm when tens of thousands of people died, one hundred forty four officers injured and some even died? This really saddens me. You are trying to sane wash him."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump is ultimately about the preservation and protection of white privilege.  That's his attraction.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"The question is why after 9 years the media still doesntbknow how to cover him honestly, accurately  and responsibly. Perhaps he brings in too much money for the NY Times."
CxA3mLuwzp8,I would not trust Trump to be a janitor in my condo.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Everything is wrong with Trump 
He is con man,  rapist, he is the list qualified, Anti Christ, we can't have a demon as president."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Addled?
CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump is the man today that he has been all of his life. This kind of person can never be trusted to lead this country.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"But JD Vance is a liar, evern if he knows how to inhibit himself."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Stop making excuses for a vulgar, moronic, felon. This is why he does as well as he does. Stop normalizing deviance."
CxA3mLuwzp8,A clinical opinion is what is needed.
CxA3mLuwzp8,He has lost his mind
CxA3mLuwzp8,Why in trump world all the bad things happened to women ???
CxA3mLuwzp8,"You must take into account who makes up Trump's audience,  mostly undereducated people who act more like enablers to Trump's uninhibited and low actions and statements."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"When trump asked the crowd In the Middle of the Nevada Desert if they noticed all the shark attacks lately, NYT and all other media outlets turned your backs, picking apart everything President Biden said.  If President Biden had said it, you would have Gleefully printed it on the front page in letters a Foot High.  Shame on all of you for creating the Pox called trump"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Your inability to simply call him a malignant narcissist IS the problem. If he is elected furture generations will ask how could you elect such a maniac? And you'll say what? The Goldwater rule? Really? The naivety is deeply troubling.
CxA3mLuwzp8,I can't imagine how much strength people like Pence and Raffensberg had in those moments when they were threatened like they were. I bow my head down to the floor for people like them. Incredible. If Trump wins he will kick out EVERYONE who disagree with him and still call himself the biggest defender of democracy in the history of mankind.
CxA3mLuwzp8,Very astute and nuanced assessment of Trump.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"This was an amazing listen, thankyou. New fan here !"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I agree. 
It's not him... 
The problem is the people voting for him! They are the problem... 
Make no mistake. 
He's not the problem."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Actually, we do have the language to describe him ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ - it’s right there for everyone to see and the words are in the DSM  🤷‍♀️
I do vehemently disagree that he hasn’t changed since 2016 - look at the old interview with Barbara Walters, the man is articulate. 2016, the sentence structure & vocabulary used is much more simplistic. In 2024, he is often inarticulate. There is a clear downward progression in his ability to verbally communicate"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"If Trump's glorious disinhibition was capable of doing anything positive for the bulk of the populous I might be okay with it.  It can't though because Trump isn't even slightly motivated to do that.  2016 represents about the best we can do with him because he was at least motivated to deliver something to his constituents because he wanted to be reelected.  If he gets reelected it will all be about him.  The ""forgotten man"" will be forgotten again."
CxA3mLuwzp8,You’re describing a frontal lobe deficiency.  I’ve known several people with frontal temporal degeneration. They share many of trump’s traits.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"After 18 minutes I couldn't listen any longer.   The article is much too exculpatory; and it minimizes the extreme damage that tRump has done, and can still do, to our system of government.  We must concentrate on ways to ensure that a psychologically damaged person can not assume or exercise the power that tRump has so misused."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Disinhibition could suggest some frontal lobe impairment ,which would certainly affect an individuals impulse control and risk assessment ability, which would be disqualifying for a commander in chief.Furthermore, and also not age related, It is likely Trump has a lifelong learning disability secondary to his untreatable personality disorder. At 78, you can't fix his monumental ignorance."
CxA3mLuwzp8,I actually think Putin might take care of Trump.  (astrology)
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Trump is a HATER!! He hates Our America, Our Military & Our Heroes…like John McCain, Our Intelligence, Our Democracy, Our Freedoms and You, the American People!! Save Our America & Vote Blue!!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Trump epitomizes, encompasses, and exhibits ALL of the worst American tendencies.  And so do his followers."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I disagree, Ezra, that Trump “cannot inhibit/control himself.”  He can.  He chooses not to.  He has lived for 78 years by NOT inhibiting himself, by steamrolling over those who do.  It works for him.  He is not going to dispense with a winning game plan."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"""Ezra Klein on What’s Wrong with Trump"" WHAT! do you think I've got all day?"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Oh, give me a break!  Trump is a Sociopath, period."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Its not whats wrong with trump. Its what's wrong with legacy media, republican pols,  bilionaires, and a bunch of americans who believe bs decade after decade after decade."
CxA3mLuwzp8,You give Shitzhizpantz WAY TOO MUCH credit. The reason he gets away with what he gets away with is because he is WHO THE REPUGliKKKLAN electorate is
CxA3mLuwzp8,Excellent assessment! I recommend the Conspirituality podcast. There is also an element of cult leader in him.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"He is not unique, he is destroying our country. The minions who back him have a plan, and it’s not a good plan for the masses. Trump is dangerous. He isn’t electric. He is so obnoxious. There is nothing truthful about him. Trump is a LOSER."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Dude democrats aren’t the only ones saying this: trump inherited a stable economy from Obama, he is a proven business failure, rapist, racist, ill health, fake, coward, and could go on , so STF Ezra Klein"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"This piece was thoughtful, balanced and brilliant. Thank you."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Where this shines is not as illumination of Trump--after all, we've heard years of insights and warnings from George Will,  Mary Trump, George Conway, and others--but as an illumination of his supporters.  They are not stupid but instead so aggrieved that they see bluster as strength, lies as the courage to fight ""woke,"" and recklessness as heroism.  You are not extolling him but explaining why people admire him."
CxA3mLuwzp8,There are too many things wrong with a person like Trump to be a President of the USA to look for any positive aspect of such a personality❗️❗️❗️
CxA3mLuwzp8,Brilliant
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Americans have set the precedent! ""Trumpism,"" is the precedent! Now what????? Trump himself, is old, & won't be a problem for much longer, but what about trumpism? What about people like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, J.D.Vance, Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr., (keep an eye on him!) & every other right leaning, power hungry, law adverse, sycophant out there, following in the footsteps of the last 10 years, who also has realised the amount of $$$ to be had, & power to be weilded, by holding the office of the President of the U.S.of A.? The ""rails"" held the trump administration, from the worst that could have happened. We wont be that fortunate a second time! We need that ""reckoning"" some spoke of during those offensive trump years! Changes need to made to a constitution that knew not, of 21st century liabilities. $$$!! The potential $$$ involved alone, in holding the office of the President, is beyond disturbing! Lets not forget the old adage, used often by the mob, that makes the observation , that ""everyone, has a price!""...America, we love you! We do!...but for the sake of humanity, we beg of you, please clean up your yard! It's bringing down the real estate value, of the neighbourhood! ...✌🇨🇦"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump was allowed to get this far and fully enabled because many people in the background are making shitloads of money off the chaos. Count on that being the priority over all else.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"In a weird way Trump has made me believe in the overall American system. With a lunatic at the helm, we still managed to get by."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"To put yhe words honesty and trump together is ridiculous.
He's dangerous."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"No Ezra Klein it is ""The Age"" you have all allowed. Because Trump et al can throw money - mostly other people's money at idiotic lawyers. Idiotic? Is that unfair. The percentage of cases lost so far is high."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Mental illness on Trumps level is raer.
He ahould share a cell with Hannabel"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I am just hearing this early on Sunday morning -- two days before the election -- and it is one of the most insightful audio essays I've EVER heard. Needless to say, I believe it is spot on -- brilliant. But here's the thing: what Klein has just described...is a sociopath! This is exactly the psychological profile and description of a sociopath -- someone whose narcissism is entirely unconstrained by normal, human inhibition."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Whats wrong with  traitor trump? Hes a loser.  And he farts all the time.
CxA3mLuwzp8,How many times have you grabbed someone by the 😾 and not been fired from your job?
CxA3mLuwzp8,I didn’t hear anything new or surprising here. This is what the world has been talking about for more than eight years.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Ezra, you need to learn and admit that you are not the subject matter expert on psychology.  That is why you don’t have the language to discuss who Trump is or what his core issues are.  Had you for a moment humbled yourself and interviewed true domain experts who could explain Trump’s diagnoses, we might not be where we’re at.   Mary Trump has been doing her darndest but she doesn’t get enough air time.  There are plenty of others beyond Mary you could’ve talked to as well."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"The media props up that psychotic old man, sane-washes and defends him because they are complicit in endeavoring to have an autocratic tyrant as the despotic dictator for this country.  Whether they are in direct cahoots with the billionaires who believe misogyny and racism help to ""keep people under control"" and serves to continue to maintain a marginalized  population of have-nots who will some day be forced to labor for free in industries and serve as slaves and breeding machines, the mainstream media of national network news reporting is deliberately part of this exploitation to knock all minorities and all women into total powerlessness.   The mere fact that they normalize this monster is all the proof we need."
CxA3mLuwzp8,His actions killed people.  Not so bad???
CxA3mLuwzp8,"""You can look at these clips"" *no clips shown*"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Thanks, Ezra.  This is _very_  good work.  Many of us have been thinking and saying parts of this, even most of this - but this is probably the clearest and most thorough distillation I have come across, of the dangerous buffoon.   If ever there was a piece of writing that voters in your country really should listen to and think about, this is it."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Fascinating podcast. Thank you !
May nature have its course before the end of the year, please. 
Love the failing microphones because of his refusal to pay for the venues and technicians."
CxA3mLuwzp8,you do not get to do too much damage in just 4 years  and who says he has not done a tremendous amount of damage not just to our country but in the larger world  . Granted that last 07 would need to be analyzed by others.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I don't find an uninhibited person exciting, admirable, charismatic, or any of those positive qualities."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"It's all well and good trying to psychoanalyze Trump and describing his personality traits, and I agree with a lot that's said here, but I think it all comes down to the sheer narcissism and entitlement that came about from his upbringing. ""Disinhibition"" is just a fancy way of saying that he's gone through life having his sycophants praise his every word, so of course he says whatever enters his mind."
CxA3mLuwzp8,It's not his age it's his insanity & inanity
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I agree with many things you were saying, but you're giving your own newspaper and other media too much of a pass. The Times and others have refused to point out his cognitive deficiencies when it was your job to point that out."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Best explanation of Drumpf I’ve heard
CxA3mLuwzp8,"JD Vance thinks Americans are stupid - that we don't know that Trump embedded the feigned admonition to ""march peacefully"" in the midst of his stochastic rhetorical tirade was nothing other than plausible cover for mounting an insurrection intended to disrupt Congressional certification of the Presidential election. JD Vance glosses over the insurrection as if it never happened. I'm surprised that Ezra didn't pounce on that deception with his usual alacrity. Maybe Ezra has a touch of the maga virus himself. My, what an unhealthy regression to a promising talent."
CxA3mLuwzp8,disinhibition is also a symptom of many mental illnesses. also what the hell is wrong with your country you have the memories of goldfish. if you don't remember  the problems he caused last time then this time he could destroy you and the rest of the western world.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"its not confusion its dishonesty. ask any psycholigest or psychiatrist and they have the words , almost all of them say the same thing. personality dissorder, narcissisim , and much worse . they can diagnose him because they have seen more of him than of most of there patients."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Trump spews propaganda from Putin to America. Today, Trump made a terroristic death threat against Liz Chaney and now the media is “mansplaining” it to America. Trump should be charged with the death threat he made against Liz Chaney!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,His talk is decades of afluenza!
CxA3mLuwzp8,This idiot get way too much credit from overthinkers on the left.
CxA3mLuwzp8,NOBODY has a pass to tread on our democracy!!!!!! Especially a 70 something 2-year--old!!!
CxA3mLuwzp8,"So true 
Trump was not frozen and didn’t know what he was doing at that particular rally when he started dancing or swaying from left to right 

He knew what he was doing…..it was the other people like that woman who was talking to him like he was in an old folk home……

She froze and didn’t really know what to do 😢😢"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Trump supporters don""t care.  They don't care what he says, or what he does in any negative sense - there is no accountability.   Ezra Klein is a brilliant observer who joins the crowd of those who try to explain, to make sense of the MAGA madness.  Never mind explaining Donald Trump.  The greater puzzle is how to apply reason to the phenomenon of Trumpism. As an American who has always believed in democracy, I am plunged into despair by the thought that so many of my fellow citizens want to follow Trump, after the events of the last eight years.  Where is thinking?  Where is commitment to justice, commitment to the constitution?  In his second inaugural address, Lincoln promoted unity appealing  to ""the better angels of our nature"".  How far have we sunk?  I read this excellent editorial and wonder what will happen to intellectual opposition if Trump is re-elected.  Where is rational thought?  Where is freedom of expression?  Where is the America I have loved?"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Foetal alcohol effect  Syndrome.
CxA3mLuwzp8,The one thing that can not be explained is how 70 million Americans are so gullible and willing to put themselves at risk following a con man. Is this like a 1978 Jonestown remake?
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Things were ""good"" or ""not that bad"" while he was president because Obama left us with low prices, low inflation and high employment. Trump Lanced both those things with Tariffs and a pandemic years into his tenure. If he stayed in office we'd be a country isolated from Europe and the rest of the world with high prices and taxes. We'd be vulnerable to attacks from hostile nations. Trump is an insider threat."
CxA3mLuwzp8,tRump is nuts! Vote democrat!
CxA3mLuwzp8,"When I was a kid, I watched the debate between Nixon and Kennedy. When it was over, I asked my Mom, why those men spoked differently from regular people. 🤔"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"This is not an unbiased podcast, definitely GOP, Maga."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Very good analysis,  You could have used it to describe Hugo Chavez in Venezuela,  he fits precisely the same Trump pattern, captivated everyone, and I guess you know what happened in Venezuela,  a demagogue with messianic beliefs it is a danger to any country or community,  Trump is a CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER"
CxA3mLuwzp8,He has a character disorder
CxA3mLuwzp8,So Trump acts like someone who is drunk but without actually drinking.
CxA3mLuwzp8,Exactly right on
CxA3mLuwzp8,"*TO BE HONEST THIS IS BULL5!T* this is self serving excuse-making, don't blame us journalists for failing democracy and humanity 

I'm an author on psychology and the collapse of civilisations - we have been writing letters to you people for 10 years explaining exactly what Trump is and the danger he poses and even NOW you cant say it - *HE IS A NARCISSIST AND A FASCIST*"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"*YOU HAVE **_ALWAYS_** HAD THE LANGUAGE                                               ITS FASCIST*

You just never had the GUTS to use the long-established language"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Good one
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Yes and no, Mr. Klein. I do believe that toward the end of the second campaign, Trump is showing signs of his age (certain experts agree when they compare his manner now with his ""young"" style). The stress is getting to him and his brain tends to snarl when put under pressure. I can see this clearly. It might be the persistent rumor that he's on medication and the dosage varies, or it might be something else. Read about Biden's stutter and how age has affected it, a medical fact most stutters exhibit, esp. under stress. I believe that Trump is susceptible to ""brain stutter,"" more likely as is suspected, that he has some kind of ADHD."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"wow, this was really insightful. Thank you, Ezra!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,Magnetic and compelling? I thought you were talking about Donald Trump. Please clarify.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"RESPECT,BUT BOTH SIDE,S ARE IN A ZONE THANK YOU FOR SHAING."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I love Donald Trump … Biden I’m garbage and I
Have my right to voto"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Question from the UK (31st Oct9ber 2024), will Trump win?"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Narcissistic Personslity Disorder is a progressive matter.  As you collapse into yourself like a dying star, the ability to resist your own gravity dissipates.  Aging only compounds that and makes one less compelled to change.  Trump, like all authoritarian personalities, is on a one-way journey to implosion, and people like Musk and Vance know it.  They can hardly wait."
CxA3mLuwzp8,We agree when they make it they break the mold
CxA3mLuwzp8,"He has very bad cognitive decline.  He has progressive dementia according to renown psychiatrist Bandi Lee, John Gartner,  Harry Segal and many more!💙💙💙💙💙💙💙"
CxA3mLuwzp8,EXCELLENT!
CxA3mLuwzp8,How many times are you going to delete my response?
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Awesome, thank you for that dose of reality. Im going to share with my family. They are a little to alot lost in this cult. Just watched the McMahon doc. Very similar but individually unique stories . Thank you 😊"
CxA3mLuwzp8,What's wrong with Trump. It would be easier to list the thing that are not wrong........
CxA3mLuwzp8,"It really is insane how trump has clearly gone through a major cognitive decline and it goes unmentioned, but anytime Biden said anything incorrectly, he is persecuted. 
Trump is allowed to slur through speeches, saying crazy’s as stuff, and it reported that he’s perfectly well. 

Trump is out of his mind and gets away with saying such wild stuff and given a lifetime pass, which Biden didn’t get. 

Neither Biden nor trump should be presidential options at any level. 

We need youth like Obama injected k to running the country."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Would not this also be a critique of an anti-christ? 

Unintelligent, self absorbed, petty, and uncaring.

Yes, Donald J. Trump perfectly fits the bill."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Words matter- listen to his words.
CxA3mLuwzp8,Vote Trump!!
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Here's something fun, the language on this platform, You Tube, stops me at every turn from saying what I want to say= it warns me that I'll be cut off if I don't delete. and YET, this guy says crazy stuff. we are broken, I am numb. BUT I did VOTE BLUE!!!!!!"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Insanity ages differently. You'll have to excuse me, I'm writing a cook book on how to serve pets."
CxA3mLuwzp8,There will be a civil war if he gets in
CxA3mLuwzp8,I'm scared he will  wiIm from Scotladn
CxA3mLuwzp8,"You have been far too generous to a man that is so dangerous.  There is a duty to report when harm is imminent,  as is the case here."
CxA3mLuwzp8,The (cognizant) sharks misunderstood who the woman was.  😑
CxA3mLuwzp8,"YOU  :  donald trump is 
unique
ME :  donald trump is  a pathological liar...
a raging narcissist...a constant thief....
  A rapist....  
Disloyal.... untrustworthy...
 he's completely void of empathy & emotions....
He's a human who will stop @ NOTHING to get what he wants no matter what that may be.....

Hes a human that should have been imprisoned LONG AGO for his vicious assaults on EVERY person unfortunate enough to have met him...
 & now for his  vicious assaults on the entire country

All of these characteristics does not make him unique....
   They make him a 
     DANGEROUS

CxA3mLuwzp8,Excellent insight.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but I seem to remember a time when if you try to overthrow the United States government you ended up in prison😮"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"He has less and less voters. Vote blue. And if you don't normally vote, make an emergency exception and vote blue. Then in 2 years be ready to vote blue again mid presidential-election. We have too many oligarch supported congress peoples. We the people make our republic a democracy, and democracy is not a spectator sport 🌊🌊🌊"

CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump: It was a day of love.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"In UK, Johnson believed in and wished to do what Trump did in 2020, when he was forced to resign."
CxA3mLuwzp8,So what happens if Trump gets back in - no guardrails. A White House full of Project 25-ers
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Video Title: ""... What’s Wrong with Trump [ ? ] "";
surely you can't hope to cover THAT MUCH in a measly little 44 minute exposition."
CxA3mLuwzp8,Ask yourself who you want leading America in the world first is an idi0t like Harris or a leader like Trump
CxA3mLuwzp8,But biden was OK right?  😂😂😂😂
CxA3mLuwzp8,14.55 - Musk definitely wants what Trump represents.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Listening to Trump taking about Bush’s mistake in going into going into Iraq (12.20) clearly shows his decline in energy, thought processes, ability ti formulate sentences, let alone arguments. He may not have changed in character - he is, however, greatly diminished in cognition."
CxA3mLuwzp8,One thing the left is good at is lying propaganda bullcrap like you are listening to now
CxA3mLuwzp8,What’s wrong with the NYTimes?
CxA3mLuwzp8,Trump is a Marionett.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"As a fiscal conservative / social progressive Republican, nothing scares me more than the likes of Chief of Staff Miller, Secretary of Efficiency Musk, and Secretary of State Bannon. Trump is just a bully without them."
CxA3mLuwzp8,That was a powerful piece of reporting. And existentially appalling.
CxA3mLuwzp8,TRUMP 2024!
CxA3mLuwzp8,Excellent report and really a pretty fair analysis of the   things that make Donald Trump both unique and interesting yet simultaneously frightening as a candidate for the world's most powerful job.

Yes, by doing this, these accomplices, as did Trump, VIOLATED our nation’s military SECURITY - the security of the people who live in the United States - that's you and me. They all violated our national safety  and defense.

CxA3mLuwzp8,This commentary was thoughtful and enlightening.
CxA3mLuwzp8,"He knows he lost but he choose to stay in power where he had power over the world. He and his wife enjoyed the power and do not know how to let go. Greed breeds greed, time to boot him totally out of politics and charge to all the crimes he committed."
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Trump's policies are disgusting, so half the country is disgusting"
CxA3mLuwzp8,"He’s nuts, his supporters are even nuttier"
CxA3mLuwzp8,I thought it was his hair😂
CxA3mLuwzp8,"Listen to Mary Trump. She has the language and the family history
."
CxA3mLuwzp8,What Karisma?? Your overthinking it.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Truly scary how many people swallowed the liberal koolaid then realized they are the baddies.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trump won 🏆
cOLqSUK0eBM,Thank you for electing Trump
cOLqSUK0eBM,At least he defended Hinchcliff. Jon still got comedy's back.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Well John, you got Biden to drop out and we lost. I'm not a fan anymore."
cOLqSUK0eBM,Now we know why Beyonce did not sing. They cannot afford her anymore. Budget deficit.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Shows how out of touch the insane liberal media is
cOLqSUK0eBM,HILARIOUS
cOLqSUK0eBM,"they're going back to south America, not to a gas chamber. i am so sorry you have such a low opinion of south America."
cOLqSUK0eBM,8:11
cOLqSUK0eBM,Jon MF Stewart Thank you for your dedicated service. Despite your attempts for YEARS to teach us people have failed but you have not. You are appreciated sir!
cOLqSUK0eBM,"I hope those ""Blacks for Trump"" folks are proud 

And i dunno how these messages can claim to be from an administration of a man that hasn't been in sworn in yet, if this is someone from his to-be administration it's probably someone like Steven Miller lol"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Strange how quiet this thread has gone.
cOLqSUK0eBM,didnt he promise this during his first term
cOLqSUK0eBM,Wondering. Will you able to pick a country to go to and will there be relocation expenses paid if you get deported??? Plane tickets are expensive. Would be nice to get away for 4 years.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Well, that’s why we voted for him and we had a vote on it. 150 million people voted for Trump the red wave."
cOLqSUK0eBM,I am a deported citizen and I have been away from home for 12 years now. No one is there to help me! I have no money for the lawyers fees. No one bats an eye!
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Well at least I thought that was funny and possible even, insightful. 
 Thank you for your time."

cOLqSUK0eBM,Jon Stewart election night
cOLqSUK0eBM,"What better world it's going to be 100 times worst first now. Not only is every Trump minded cousin even more powered up to vote for their Trumps abroad but also some Regimes like the German one most likely let them in, before there is any chance to blame the civilians for that. Like, I don't know if I need to go rehab to learn to not give a fk or sth but hope has kind of left the door  even motivated activists who almost gave their life's for that better world are unsubscribing to every non right wing channel because they're done. Idocracy has one and I am afraid it'll exactly go there were most of were awkwardly tried to be raised out of. No one complain about birth rates being pretty much non existing for the next 10. And that might be one of the less harmful side effects. Don't expect any help from any minority, they're done with people look like you and me not listening. Maybe a miracle happens it was really counted wrong  🙏 but feel like the damage that hasn't even been done yet already is underlined..🌎"
cOLqSUK0eBM,He won live with   it
cOLqSUK0eBM,In 1930-1933 there was a Mass deportation of Mexican people. They didn’t care if you were born in the USA with american parents but if you had a hispanic name or looked hispanic you were going back to Mexico. What a scary thought that that may happen again.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Mad respect for Jon giving a tip of the cap like a true comedian forget the politics . Funny is funny real respects real

cOLqSUK0eBM,It's wild to see all the hate and anger from Trump lovers when I thought they'd finally be happy. At least Chris Pratt proved to be a gentleman. I guess that's a real Christian man for ya
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Hearing the most dry, unfunny human beings, walking the earth, trying to tell us what’s funny, is so wild"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Thank you Jon for coming back during 2024-2025. take care of your ❤👩🏼‍⚕️🩺 we need you for comedy relief and truth
cOLqSUK0eBM,This show wasn't even funny when i was 11.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Hmmmm seems like you lost John 😢
cOLqSUK0eBM,"THE MAGA FACTS NOT THE DEMS TRUTHS* 
TRUMP won The Popular and Electoral Vote by 2:00 AM 11/6/24 with at least 3 states yet to declare 
This time *NO DEM CHEATING* and it's not like they didn't try - Look it up 
The Patriots have spoken, not the *DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST* trying to Fundamentally change our Nation as China Joe promised"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trump 2025. COPE
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Imagine being so brainwashed you actually still believe Trump is sexist, racist, etc. and actually believe he called for violence on January 6th. It amazes me how selectively edited every clip I have ever seen of Trump on MSM and also how misleading the commentary is. Doesn’t MSM realize how easy it is to pull up the full speeches in context? Anyone can sound sexist, racist, violent, etc. if you edit them way out of context and also give extremely biased commentary on those clips.

Trump’s actual speeches and actual actions have plenty of problems, many of which would alienate his base. I will always wonder how the Trump phenomenon would have been different if MSM had focused on Trump’s REAL problems instead of making up fake problems and harping on those clearly fake allegations exclusively. When you lie so blatantly about someone it creates a certain amount of support for that person from people who see through those lies. It’s not the only reason he won, but it’s why he wasn’t laughed out of office when running as a primary candidate. It’s also why he faces completely illegal prosecution instead of actual prosecution for what I suspect are very real crimes he likely committed. Distracting from his real problems by trying to constantly frame him for fake allegations that are easy to disprove isn’t a particularly effective strategy."
cOLqSUK0eBM,I love JESSICA!!!!
cOLqSUK0eBM,America is for AMERICANS...ALL RACES. BUT U NEED TO BE AN AMERICAN!!!
cOLqSUK0eBM,Jon... can't help but notice your name on the Epstein flight log.

cOLqSUK0eBM,"I'm so disgusted with Merrick Garland slow and pathetic pace to bring this pathetic monster to justice 😡 Right now, I have have not one ounce of fight left in me. Thanks for nothing merrick garland. 😢"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Man that ending was terrible
cOLqSUK0eBM,"They broke in illegally, and then were given amnesty by America hating libtards."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Broke into the country illegally, is enough to send them home."
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trump took 54% of Hispanic men. Offended on behalf of others. Just like liberals always are.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"What happened to your viewers, John?"
cOLqSUK0eBM,How can I block even seeing him momentarily…..so that I don’t have to unburden myself later on.

cOLqSUK0eBM,Thank you John and staff. Tonight is dark. Very DARK. After that I'm speechless.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Yeah. If you're looking for a reason why she lost to trump, watch that last part of the segment."

cOLqSUK0eBM,"14:04 Except instead of the Irish or Italians, he's going to mass deport ""anyone brownish""."
cOLqSUK0eBM,It's XENOPHOBIC to want a country that has a valid immigration process now
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Amen, John. My family changed their last name to try and avoid being tagged as German"
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Did he give the ""roasting comedian "" a pass?"
cOLqSUK0eBM,"The five men at Madison Square Garden are crazy. These are the type of people Trump will have in his cabinet. We have far too many uneducated,racist,ignorant,blind to Trump’s hate who will destroy our democracy for decades to come. How sad."
cOLqSUK0eBM,👏👏👏👏

cOLqSUK0eBM,No excuses should be made for Tucker Carlson.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Who tf listens to Beyoncé on who to vote for 😂 so pathetic
cOLqSUK0eBM,Wait...is Drumph face blind?
cOLqSUK0eBM,Brothers like... oh no dont show me that... at least the devil offered me water in the desert ...

cOLqSUK0eBM,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Yeah, no. Absolutely not!"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Probably Stephen Miller was the guy who found the 1798 Alien and Sedition Act.
cOLqSUK0eBM,💙💙💙
cOLqSUK0eBM,"So, no one's gonna mention the fact that Jessica Williams sitting across from Jon Stewart at the desk looks like one of those optical illusion rooms where two people stand on opposite sides of the room and one looks massively larger than the other? I'm the only one who noticed that? I'm the only one that's gonna say it out loud? 😂"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Jon Stewart for president
cOLqSUK0eBM,Beyoncé needs to go sit down somewhere.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Maga 2024

The ending was weird"
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Now just bring back jon Oliver, Stephen Colbert and Steve carell and the show will blow up like anything....."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Tucker Carlson's laugh scares the 💩 out of me. 
It’s worse than a horror movie."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"It's funny how the Trumpers say America for Americans!
(I wonder what the native Americans think of this!)"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Cotton picking joke i cant believe its aired
cOLqSUK0eBM,Jon Stewart is the best commentator in America 🤣
cOLqSUK0eBM,Don’t forget he was the best president of our lifetimes you liberal clowns
cOLqSUK0eBM,Liberals are destroying the free world

cOLqSUK0eBM,Thank you Jon! 💕💙❤️💙
cOLqSUK0eBM,"As he plans to deport illegal migrants with anchor babies,    can we start with Melania & Baron?   Then do Ivana's children  (Don,   Eric,   Ivanka).     Tiffany is Trump's only legal,   American child."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Hi John with a surname of Stewart,you would be deported to Scotland !!!!! Terrific.Welcome home.!!!!! 😊😊"
cOLqSUK0eBM,"""For Democrats to win we must ignore the Constitution."" Senator BHO."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"The outcome was decided years ago. Participating only tells the system that you believe that the system itself is valid. It's not. IF you want to change something ""Vote Jill Stein please 2024"""""
cOLqSUK0eBM,Today us Harris Day we cancel convict trump
cOLqSUK0eBM,And now I see people have added to the ship of fools.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"John. I hope this is your last show EVER!  You are not funny, and your political points and leftist slants are PATHETIC!"
cOLqSUK0eBM,"I can't believe how much of an absolute idiot, Trump is"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Illegal immigrants criminals?? Does that include his Russian mobsters?
cOLqSUK0eBM,"A governor from PA has NO idea who Kamala is much less speaking as if he knows what she will do. STOP comparing what our govt did to vet ppl who ended up in this country from other countrys. Japan was the enemy so making sure that the Japanese citizens (or any other group) are not going to be terrorists in our country in retaliation of the war is important. If we had done this when educating those 9/11 terrorist mayb 9/11 would never have happened. WE cant just assume every group or any1 else crossing the border ILLEGALLY is here just cuz they ""love America""."
cOLqSUK0eBM,So why do we have Trump make the decision to separate the families he some of the children still haven't found their families yet from the last time he reported them
cOLqSUK0eBM,😂
cOLqSUK0eBM,Ask him about the underage kids that he molested in Epstein's house
cOLqSUK0eBM,Have him Deport Melania and her father they came over illegally in Trump's plane and got your papers here from Giuliani papers here from Giuliani
cOLqSUK0eBM,"YAY, JON!!!"

cOLqSUK0eBM,"why on EARTH Jon are you not knocking this 
BS OFF"
cOLqSUK0eBM,I’m sorry Jon
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Does Trump not realize that people aren’t gonna let this deportation happen without a fight? 

Trump supporters tried to fight in January 6th over a lie. 

Try stopping working class people fighting over their actual loved one’s lives."
cOLqSUK0eBM,We had a Japanese concentration camp in my hometown Missoula Montana
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Celebrity endorsements were divided between the two candidates

She has (A) class celebrities 
He, has (B)een celebrities"
cOLqSUK0eBM,Are you CERTAIN your vote is being represented fairly equally and accurately?
cOLqSUK0eBM,And then he's going to hire them for 2 cents an hour to make American products
cOLqSUK0eBM,Very REAL Speech and I hope a lot of people heard it.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Had an ancestral cousin  Sgt Elijah Townsley  with the 89th OVI who was captured here and would die of scurvy at Amdersonville in November 1864
cOLqSUK0eBM,TRUMP 2024!!
cOLqSUK0eBM,When i tell people around me that in a mass deportation scheme there will be us citizen caught up in that they look at me weird but i definitely believe that will happen if he gets a chance todo this
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Tucker Carlson & the rest of the GOP presenters at MSB were very, very solid people & totally NOT a bunch of weirdos, believe me."
cOLqSUK0eBM,After JS interview with Coates I am not as convinced of his objectivity as I once was.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"when/if trump go to prison, I hope they dont come up with a reality show from there~~ dont drop the soap Donold"
cOLqSUK0eBM,This is definetely NOT going to help the millions of still undecided but yet crucial voters to do what is right. A brief but clear resumé of Project 2025 would probably help them more to make up their mind whether they really want a dangerous Putin wannabe rather out for revenge than to play the lead role on the international scene AND to combat inflation in the Oval Office
cOLqSUK0eBM,Who ever this cameraman or camerawoman is.....ever done.....best video I've seen this election
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trump is a 👹🤡💩🤬👺😈
cOLqSUK0eBM,We watch this and cringe!
cOLqSUK0eBM,"I would sooner vote for Jeff Spicoli to ""fix it"""
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Hopefully, only in an alternate reality, but there will be a lot of surprised persons come 2025 on ""day one"" --> enemy is whoever I say it is..."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Don't listen to what Trump says, listen to what his advisor and speech writer Steven Miller says. 
And read Project 2025 Phase I, because there is a Phase II that they have not released and won't disclose until AFTER Trump is in office and Phase I has replaced everyone that would work to stop it.
Steven Miller is a fascist to the core, as general Mike Milley has said Trump is.
A vote for Trump IS a vote for a Fascist regime in the USA."
cOLqSUK0eBM,Guess who else did mass deportations on “Day 1”. Just sayin
cOLqSUK0eBM,How is it that this wasn't covered by Late Night https://youtu.be/LXW27SZieRk?si=QpOPrqtaEpiutzXG
cOLqSUK0eBM,"I don't understand Stewart's logic. If the comic is ""just doing what he does"", then ... hiring him is no surprise. They hired someone who does racist jokes. That's a pretty straightforward thing to criticize Trump for."
cOLqSUK0eBM,🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😅😅😅😅😅😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
cOLqSUK0eBM,"It took me a long time to realize that certain elements within the Jewish community harbor a level of resentment towards white people. This sentiment is often right out in the open for anyone to see—I just never recognized it before.

I grew up very close to a Jewish family and have a great deal of respect for many prominent Jewish individuals, which made it difficult for me to acknowledge. Actually seeing it for the first time was even harder. There seems to be a lot of double standards and hypocrisy in the ideologies held by these particular elements. I believe it’s largely the influence of the political left shaping these attitudes within parts of the Jewish community.

With the horror of World War II still relatively recent, it’s perhaps easy to see how a reflexive hatred toward anything perceived as ""white"" or nationalist could take root.

These views are often revealed openly, yet those expressing them seem oblivious to the underlying false narratives that drive them. The mental gymnastics, the manipulation, the smearing, the arrogance—all of it has the hallmarks of a cult.

It’s worth noting that the highest levels of the U.S. government are certainly aware of how effective cult tactics can be and have undoubtedly studied them closely."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"I really, really, REALLY want to see more former correspondents make an appearance with Jon in future segments.
Love Jennifer Williams."
cOLqSUK0eBM,🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😢😢😢😅😅😅😅😊😊😊
cOLqSUK0eBM,I vote Jill Stein ❤
cOLqSUK0eBM,If he deports migrants and illegals food prices are gonna go up the roof
cOLqSUK0eBM,That’s why I wasn’t getting listens
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trump in 24 he used to be funny but he is playing policy
cOLqSUK0eBM,"How did we get here? Why is Trump a viable candidate? Is it because the, Clinton, Obama and Biden frustrated the people so badly that they would turn to someone like Trump? George Carlin was right when he said they threw the Working & Middle Class overboard 30 years ago."
cOLqSUK0eBM,He is back.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trump for prison 2024 PLEASE!!!!
cOLqSUK0eBM,"I'll bet if those ""celebrities"" had been on the set, they would have said things like ""Oh, Jon, it's just comedy. We were doing shtick. I mean, you're a Jew; surely you get it."""
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trans women bleed to.   We need tampons free in every restroom.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Tampons for everyone!   Men can have a period to you know
cOLqSUK0eBM,welcome to the DailyTrump show 😂
cOLqSUK0eBM,"If Trump had a grain of intelligence, he'd know the _Alien and Sedition Acts_ were wildly unpopular, and derided as the biggest mistake of John Adam's presidency. It was designed to curb immigrant votes for the opposition."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"😅😭 day one, have a nack!"
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Justice for Wyatt, though."
cOLqSUK0eBM,Kamala!!!
cOLqSUK0eBM,Than you Jon for bringing up the hatred towards the Irish and Italians at the turn of the century. Stephen Miller is PeeWee Goebels.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"When you think about it, IFFFF Chumpo the Orange orang were elected, his mass deportation would be unfeasible, like ""Noah's ark"" or something. Does he think we have the money to put them all on planes and send them off? How many planes for how many months to take away X number of people."
cOLqSUK0eBM,Literally a dumb person
cOLqSUK0eBM,Steve Bannon told Trump about 1798 Enemies Act. Ideological fascist.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"The internments during World War Two were mainly of Japanese-Americans (and a few German-Americans) who were solely US citizens, not Japanese and/or German citizens (which would have made sense as they would have been foreign nationals of an enemy power)."
cOLqSUK0eBM,Democracy over party
cOLqSUK0eBM,"There is no redemption for Trump weirdos, none..."
cOLqSUK0eBM,It continues to boggle my mind that anyone would vote for Trump.
cOLqSUK0eBM,"It’s funny and most of it true in a satirical way. Trump is an existential threat but he did not come out of a vacuum. The overreaching proselytizing irresponsible self-righteous left with disregard for standards, law and order, and thinly veiled self serving “humanitarian causes” have done more to prop up Trump than anything else. I see intelligent people who’s going to vote for Trump and I wonder how but more the media, including the comedians limit, their outrage to “unhinged Trump,” the more they ignore the valid discontent of the moderate right and demonize them. Just look at the streets of Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Oakland where the left has had a free rein to exercise their arrogant, self-serving or misguided, at best, policies.  If Trump loses, which he must,and the democrats and the media continue their one sided agenda, Turmpism will resurface with a different face, one that may be not as easy to ridicule. Look at McConnell who thought Trump will be gone after Jan 6. Trump survives not because of MAGA base but because of the left."
cOLqSUK0eBM,"Stewart is a typical Hollyweird fraud.  As usual, he ignores the REAL racists in his own Democratic Party because he's too busy covering up their racial stench, their anti-Semitism, and their anti-Asian/anti-white bigotry.

Let's count the ways, shall we:  start with Al Sharpton, the sub-human POF who framed 3 innocent whites in The Tawana Brawley Hoax.....then it's Black LIES Matter, a pro-criminal pro-race riot scam outfit that stole tens of millions for ""social justice"" and put it into McMansions.....then it's the NAACP and CBC, which both support Jim Crow Liberal policies like racial quotas and DEI.

I really don't think Jon Stewart wants to debate racial morality with the vast majority of Americans who don't live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan or Beverly Hills California."
cOLqSUK0eBM,Jon Stewart came back cuz he loves Trump. try to explain it different.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Rich white man privilege will only save you if you don't criticize Trump.
cOLqSUK0eBM,Trump projects his self image of himself on others😂😂😂
cOLqSUK0eBM,It really is miraculous how u nin telli ge nt Jon can sound with so much confidence
cOLqSUK0eBM,"No one is deporting American citizen. Stop your craziness . All your socialist utopia of Europe do not allow illegal immigrants .
I am confident Jon Stewart lives ina  gated community he doesn’t have to worry about crime .
Elitist like Stewart is why Trump will win .
Jon Stewart another Jews who is ashamed of his heritage .  
The number one Jewish newspaper in USA “ Jewish press “ just endorsed Trump"

CITGJpEs9Do,"Not a single, a single, good word for conservatives/republicans. They are only bad people (nazis, garbage etc) saying & doing bad things.  On the other hand, democrats are ALWAYS righteous, correct & good. One country and one nation only as long as you don't disagree with the democrats. That's no journalism. It's pure political propaganda bordering free speech silencing fascism. And that's of course the twisted view of YOUR democracy. Not America's democracy."

CITGJpEs9Do,"Gotta accept the fact that DEMOCRATS voted for trump too at the end of the day .. this is a failure of the party not listening to its constituents time and time again and doing whatever the hell they want, they’re so blinded any money they can’t see what real people want .. atleast the Republican Party is scared of their voters and will fold to their whims no matter how deranged they are .. our side thinks we are stupid, and their side knows they’re stupid 🤦🏾 and this is what you get at the end of the day"

CITGJpEs9Do,Red sweep. Maybe don't push braindead ideologies next election.
CITGJpEs9Do,It's truly joever 😞
CITGJpEs9Do,Yo! Turn that equalizer mic bass down bruh - your voice sounds hella high brah…
CITGJpEs9Do,"It’s Jover, at this Time she needs 6 states to his Two. 😭"
CITGJpEs9Do,"Hasan’s HAPPY coz he knows if TRUMP WINS, HASAN’S WALLET WINS!"
CITGJpEs9Do,STUPID COMMIES BTFOOOO LMAOOOOOOO
CITGJpEs9Do,I feel bad for the countries that are at war defending themselves.
CITGJpEs9Do,"Let’s be entirely clear right now. This could’ve been avoided 4 years ago if the Democrats had not nominated a 77 year old Biden. We knew his age issues, we’ve seen his cognitive decline, and that’s lead him to being incredibly unpopular. It’s like we didn’t learn our lesson with Clinton in 2016 and now we’re THIS close to handing the keys to the white house to a fascist."
CITGJpEs9Do,"Latino here and I voted Harris 💙
I don’t understand how Latinos think Trump is in their favor
They will be some of the first to pay the price for it if he gets elected"
CITGJpEs9Do,Welp. Next four years should be interesting. Knew this was gonna happen. Felt exactly like 2016 leading up
CITGJpEs9Do,it’s so over for us women and queer people
CITGJpEs9Do,See y’all at the Patriotism hearings sponsored by SpaceX
CITGJpEs9Do,"When the death marches come for our LGBTQ friends, who will stand in the doorway and who will deny it as it happens?

How many of these people are willing to admit fault as their children and their childrens wives bleed out miscarrying.

We're fucked"
CITGJpEs9Do,"Streamers and commentators who speak in his style have a large following, but never a massive one, unlike Joe Rogan. They’re good speakers, debaters, and charismatic, but they lack communication skills. They’re fundamentally flawed individuals, and most people don’t like them because in today’s society, longform communication content will be the only way to get to know someone and this guy sucks."
CITGJpEs9Do,I swear to God if trumps wins I am so done with voting.
CITGJpEs9Do,If australia was allowed to vote for USA this never would have happened
CITGJpEs9Do,he won. this is going to suck.
CITGJpEs9Do,omg it’s so over
CITGJpEs9Do,Hasan spends all his time on the election and is still so wrong about the results.
CITGJpEs9Do,"thank you for basically not telling your voters to go vote hasan :l if people voted for trump because of the joe rogan podcast, then young voters that view you didnt go out to vote because of your berating of kamala these past months."
CITGJpEs9Do,"I wanted to say this so many times. You can analyze, you can talk economics, womens issues, but the truth is white people ain't gonna stand for it. They are going to make a stand."
CITGJpEs9Do,"We need to use a trump motto and never admit we lost (if it looks like we might). And fight to prevent the turnover of power just like the trump cult did on Jan 6th, except without destroying the Capitol."
CITGJpEs9Do,Americans about to get that foreign policy treatment.
CITGJpEs9Do,"Since when did USA vote for a female president? 😅😂
It is the fact. VP is achievable but President?"
CITGJpEs9Do,"Jeez , America is doomed. 💯 Trump without the Obama economy is going to be a total disaster.💯People sold their freedoms because they thought a criminal conman would get them cheap groceries in the middle of a global inflationary crisis.💯💯💯💯"
CITGJpEs9Do,The people have spoken 
CITGJpEs9Do,All over but the crying!
CITGJpEs9Do,The American people are tired of the toxic rhetoric. They are tired of the labeling. They are tired of the media trying to twist the narrative. They are tired of feminism. They are tired of the wokeness. They are exhausted of it all and made their voice heard.
CITGJpEs9Do,Man this country is cooked...hes been telling us what hes gonna do and we still  let him win....insane lol
CITGJpEs9Do,"It's funny seeing people say ""we're f'd"" when the hope has been dead since the primaries."
CITGJpEs9Do,No matter how scary things are I will hold out until every last ballot is counted
CITGJpEs9Do,"The left kept pretending they had a viable candidate, but the American people didn't buy it. The left would do themselves right by being honest with themselves instead of toxically trying to alienate people into voting for them. Have some real substance!"
CITGJpEs9Do,It’s so joever
CITGJpEs9Do,I love these comments :D Thank you ELON MUSK !!!  this is the best day ever.
CITGJpEs9Do,"Why is everyone so blackpilled? This is exactly what happened last time, Trump was leading until he wasn't. People have no patience."
CITGJpEs9Do,American ladies. Please leave now. Your men don't care about you. RUN
CITGJpEs9Do,ITS JOEVER LMAO
CITGJpEs9Do,Harris had all chances but she fckd up everything. She’s horrible
CITGJpEs9Do,"Rooting for Kamila, the Prince of Orange needs no more time to reign"
CITGJpEs9Do,Y'all really thought a woman would win lmao
CITGJpEs9Do,its so over... kamala bros... we lost
CITGJpEs9Do,"The democratic party’s genocidal support for Israel and hypocrisy cost them the election, I think."
CITGJpEs9Do,OH MY GOD I WILL VOTE 😂
CITGJpEs9Do,"We know trump lies, kamala doesn't know how to"
CITGJpEs9Do,Y'all need to breathe. It ain't even nearly done yet.
CITGJpEs9Do,"Im coping and seething, even tho I didn't vote"
CITGJpEs9Do,man i am nervous
CITGJpEs9Do,Bro… why the polls were so fucked 🤣🤣😭
CITGJpEs9Do,Let's go TRUMP!
CITGJpEs9Do,"So the Dems thought they’d win running a black woman to fight off Fascism ??🤦🏻

The Dems worked for Netenyahu and only Neyenyahu’s interests ….
They did their job
Why is no one mentioning that Israel was on of the reasons the Dems lost !"
CITGJpEs9Do,IM HERE FOR MELTDOWN
CITGJpEs9Do,Its joever guys
CITGJpEs9Do,"He KNEW, he just danced around it all for months...."
CITGJpEs9Do,I am so sad. It genuinely feels like men just hate us. I don't think I'll be watching any American news or media for awhile. Think I'll drop off social media entirely. People are just evil.
CITGJpEs9Do,"I'm not an american, however this is extremely terrifying. I am so sad for all the women, and minorities of america"
CITGJpEs9Do,Can't really be that surprised. People showed you what they are. Good luck to all of you in the coming years. Gonna need it
CITGJpEs9Do,Texan here. I am disabled and depend on mail in voting. I never received my ballot and therefore couldn't vote. This happened last time as well. The ballot eventually came but 3 weeks too late. Of course this is on purpose so as to keep Texas red. I wonder how many others didn't vote because of this.  Perhaps Texas isn't so red after all.
CITGJpEs9Do,I'm scared Hasan. And I think it's time to do a dual residency
CITGJpEs9Do,"To the American people, be careful what you ask for, and they wanted Trump. Now watch what happened because  i gave it four months before people say... Ohh HELL NO WHAT HAVE WE DONE I'M JUST SAYING 🤷"
CITGJpEs9Do,Lol cry harder
CITGJpEs9Do,All the Kamala haters in here whining cracks me up.
CITGJpEs9Do,Hassan’s viewers voted Jill Stein
CITGJpEs9Do,I can't believe that trump won.
CITGJpEs9Do,Trump 2024
CITGJpEs9Do,Haha purple hairs coping so hard
CITGJpEs9Do,Just with the climate change issue this whole world is fucked now.
CITGJpEs9Do,guys remeber last  election? just wait for the mail in ballots
CITGJpEs9Do,Reagan Landslide
CITGJpEs9Do,It’s joever
CITGJpEs9Do,"This will be a fun 4 years, wonder how long before we don’t have to worry about voting again"
CITGJpEs9Do,hasan lets date
CITGJpEs9Do,God bless America
CITGJpEs9Do,TRUMP 2024!!!! LETTSSS GOOOO ITS JOEVERRED
say6gKB8mro,This guy sucksss
say6gKB8mro,bro does not agree with Kamala Harris border policies and Hasan agrees that America is in a decline for the past 12 out of 16 years it has been the democratic party. Yea biden has made inflation go down and wage is increasing but I believe any other candidate including trump would have increased wage and decreased inflation quicker then biden or the democratic party. Then the facts to prove it is in 2016 first year Donald Trump was elected he had a wage growth of 3.5% for the median household income from 2015 in just one year is good tbh.
say6gKB8mro,"The really annoying thing about this vid is that Faze brings up good points. It makes sense why Dems look like this to regular voters. As someone who consumes a lot of political media , I know that the Dems changing on immigration this cycle was a pure calculation and is not true left ideology. But a regular person only sees the hypocrisy of calling Trump a racist and then adopting his views. Its the same with Kamala saying she owns a gun and paling around with Liz Cheney."
say6gKB8mro,Lol a lot of losers in this comment section.  Trump won.  Go scream at the Sky.
say6gKB8mro,"Dude says ""I don’t know"" or ""I’m not a political guy"" and then still tweeting about those topics he's not fully informed on— especially to a large following is honestly fucking wild. 🐒"
say6gKB8mro,Who?
say6gKB8mro,We need to legalize abortion today
say6gKB8mro,God his chat is always preventing good messaging from getting out.
say6gKB8mro,"Hasan: *Gives facts and statistics*
Faze: “I bet someone on the right could say something too”

Faze: *Brings up a topic*
Hasan: *Gives facts and statistics*
Faze: “Yeah it’s not something I’m super passionate about”"
say6gKB8mro,'people on twitter are annoying so i support trump now.' incredible dumb guy energy here.
say6gKB8mro,I'm Fazing Down.
say6gKB8mro,Hasan is talking to this guy like he is his dad or something lol. So much respect for what!?
say6gKB8mro,"why is the word ""raicist"" deemed derogatory now....? What is happening...?"
say6gKB8mro,"How can a whole group of people steal our jobs and be lazy at the same time?! It never  has and never will make sense. People think because hate exists they have a right to feel it, and that’s true, but you don’t have a right to hate people you’ve never met."
say6gKB8mro,Sorry but who??
say6gKB8mro,Audio is fucked
say6gKB8mro,"You can hear Banks processing his cognitive dissonance. He can either double tf down (which at points he did), or admit he’s wrong/misinformed and change. I really hope he does the latter but tbh most of the time people do the former."
say6gKB8mro,Hasan is a nepo baby that’s never had to struggle a day in his life 😆 . I’m down with banks all day
say6gKB8mro,Lemme leave when Hasan is finally getting thru to my dumb ass. These clowns have endless money and are dumb as rocks. What a snowflake Faze is
say6gKB8mro,"Hasan: says a fact
Banks: well, I dont agree with your left wing framing there
Bro, you've been duped into voting for Trump by the simplest of rhetorical devices."
say6gKB8mro,If this is the median voter yall are COOKED (from a European)
say6gKB8mro,This Faze dude was literally insufferable my gawd
say6gKB8mro,"Overall, seems like the average sentiment of the low propensity young dude voter who watched a few tik tok reels. We all know 10 of these dudes who ""aren't into politics"""
say6gKB8mro,Who is Faz??
say6gKB8mro,"So he's just mad libs are a bunch meanies, so now he has to white knight for trump"
say6gKB8mro,Young men need to be forced to log off. Seriously. We need a task force that makes these people go outside and help cut their elderly neighbours grass or go to a coffee shop to talk to a girl.
say6gKB8mro,I love how fb calls dems “leftist” shows whose message he listens to.
say6gKB8mro,Faze got paid
say6gKB8mro,I’m not far in the video but I have so much respect for both of them. But even more hasan for accepting who he wants to vote for and not demonizing him for it. I’m surprised actually.
say6gKB8mro,"It's interesting how so many people say how they are disappointed by how a certain party is reacting ""emotionally"" and will follow up with a statement that shows how they don't care about facts, they are angry and disappointed with women/democrats/leftists/a certain party and will now be siding with the opportunity Andrew Tate/ conservatives/ alt right racists just because the party the endorsed for years is disappointing. Which is solely an emotional reaction of a person who don't care about the consequences, just want to feel vindicated. It's also funny how so few people seem to know that historically people tend to become right wing and fascist leaning precisely because of disappointment with the other side of the political spectrum. A clever person will know that this is not a competition where you side with one party or the other, you are not on a soccer game, your future depends on the psychos you will vote for"
say6gKB8mro,Trumpers are the biggest feelings people ever. It's all emotion
say6gKB8mro,Stop being nice to these mf
say6gKB8mro,Y’all lost the culture to Trump - being communist isn’t fashionable once people get a small taste of the result of incompetency and socialism.
say6gKB8mro,"""I'm not a political guy."" We know, you endorsed Trump."
say6gKB8mro,The deflection is HEAVY in this interview… good lord. This guy is a moron.
say6gKB8mro,Pretty interesting video actually
say6gKB8mro,Trump said he loves low intelligence voters… he’s certainly got their votes wrapped up
say6gKB8mro,"Bro this hurts, literally just regurgitating one propaganda talking point after the other not understanding or hearing anything. Those points form a strong initial emotional reaction and after that there's no reasoning them away it's just blind devotion to that feeling. Grim"
say6gKB8mro,"Holy, I knew Banks was stupid, but that was suprising"
say6gKB8mro,faze banks is so regarded man 💔
say6gKB8mro,"@hasanAbi  ANYONE WHO THINKS HASAN IS SOME SORT OF SCHOLAR IS LITERALLY RETARDED. HE ISN'T ANY MORE QUALIFIED THAN THE AVERAGE MF ON THE STREET. HE CONSTANTLY TRIES TO ""EDUCATE"" PEOPLE ON HIS STREAM BUT NOTICE HOW HE PICKS AND CHOOSES NON POLITICAL PEOPLE TO BRING ON SO HE CAN EMBARASS THEM AND FEEL SUPERIOR.  HE'LL N.E.V.E.R BRING ON SOMEONE LIKE DESTINY WHO IS SMARTER THAN HIM.  HASAN THE GRIFTER LUCKED OUT AND FOUND A GRIFT THAT WORKS SO LEFTIST LARPERS THINK  HE'S EINSTEIN. ALL HASAN DOES IS MEMORIZE A FEW TALKING POINTS AND REPEATS THEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. HASAN IS LITERALLY AUTISTIC AND GETS SMOKED DAILY BY HIS LOW IQ CONTROLLING MANIPULATIVE GIRLFRIEND VALKYRAE ONLINE WHO PUBLICLY CUCKS AND HARASSES HIM CONSTANTLY LMFAOOOO HASAN IS AN EMBARASSMENT"
say6gKB8mro,"immigrants can’t vote ALSO there’s voter IDs, they just literally aren’t voting and thinking they are is so stupid. It’s common sense"
say6gKB8mro,Hasan is being so damn patient with this dumbass. Poor guy is talking to a wall. Even when you're patient with these maga idiots they just refuse to do any critical thinking.
say6gKB8mro,I’m so sick of all the sane washing for Trump we live in bizarro world. He literally just went through the motions of giving a mic stand a bj and is running for president ppls brains are cooked.
say6gKB8mro,"I hope men on the right, truly brace themselves when it comes to loneliness they blamed on women these past few years.
Women are without a doubt using this election and who you voted for as a red flag indicator.
Invest in lotion and tissue companies everyone, to the moon.🚀🌛"
say6gKB8mro,"""i'm in the center"" while not recognizing that the GOP has become extreme right and Harris is rather a centrist with positions which are often conservative/conservative leaning."
say6gKB8mro,"Why is he arguing that Biden is more racist than trump? My brother, Joe Biden is not running💀"
say6gKB8mro,"Banks: ""They are flying illegal immigrants into swing states to vote for the democrats""
Hasan: 'That's not real, do you want to look it up together and fact check it right now?""
Banks:'That's not necessary""
That kind of conversation basically looped for an hour with no progress..."
say6gKB8mro,This video demonstrates why debating a Trump supporter can be so frustrating. Hasan was dropping facts and the response was “that’s leftist framing”
say6gKB8mro,WHO.
say6gKB8mro,All this did was give me a reason to never support faze clan.  Suspiciousions confirmed.
say6gKB8mro,This is so sad Hasan 😂
say6gKB8mro,ngl I agree with banks. Talking about trump bad is the biggest waste of time which there isn't much of in the first place
say6gKB8mro,hasan is goat
say6gKB8mro,Faze down
say6gKB8mro,these guys that 'dont do politics' always fail to look at causes and effects. its always 'life was better' but they never ask why and if it was trump that caused it or not.
say6gKB8mro,Trump did say he loves the uneducated
say6gKB8mro,wtf is a faze banks
say6gKB8mro,He's right about the left and identity politics.
say6gKB8mro,I still cannot fathom how so many people believe Elon did what he did so we could have “conversations” for free speech. Like how
say6gKB8mro,Patience is insane for the type of stuff banks is saying. Again just another VIBES based voter. Holy moly man this truly. Shows. How ez it is to believe BULLSHIT cuz doing research takes up a bit of ur time. DO UR FUCKIN RESEARCH
say6gKB8mro,It's all about feelings for him. Basically voting for trump cuz lefties are mean. People are dumb
say6gKB8mro,I dont really understand why you wouldnt be in favor of the Dem Game Plan just to move to the right with Trump? Thats America i guess
say6gKB8mro,"Vote for trump. 
Source?
Trust me bro"
say6gKB8mro,"The four pretty good years under Trump is just straight hallucinations. Entirety of 2020 was spent locked down and created years of inflation. Not to mention 1 million plus excess deaths, along with mass riots and protests. We were closer to anarchy in 2020 than America has been in a century lol"
say6gKB8mro,"I dont know, seems like he wants to believe things are the way he presents them, dont seem much of a „center“ guy to me"
say6gKB8mro,This guy and Jill Stein voters are what's gonna decide the election bro we're cooked 😭
say6gKB8mro,"People keep saying ""everyone should vote, go out to vote, it's a virtue."" No! Low propensity, low infornation voters will not vote the way you think they will lol. I dont know why you would want the average idiotic bro to vote?"
say6gKB8mro,People need to recognize malicious ignorance when it presents itself. He knows why hes voting for him.
say6gKB8mro,Never knew this idiot existed 😂
say6gKB8mro,"Its strange how all the worst, dumbest people seem to migrate towards voting Trump 🤔"
say6gKB8mro,Illiterate gamerz 4 Truuuuump
say6gKB8mro,Faze is an idiot
say6gKB8mro,"Ofc he is. This isn’t the least bit surprising.
""You’re making a valid point, but I’m sure someone on the right can make a good point against it”"
say6gKB8mro,the way he’s just ignoring every point 😭
say6gKB8mro,Hasan thinks TPS IS LEGAL HAHAHA
say6gKB8mro,Its a both sides Andy who’s actually too dumb to really look into either side. 🤦🏻‍♀️
say6gKB8mro,Is this faze dude so stupid or is he pretending? You cannot be this stupid for real..
say6gKB8mro,Faze debates like a high schooler going to their first debate tournament
say6gKB8mro,I love how apathy and stupidity are the default for normiea
say6gKB8mro,Zero sum game is something I'd imagine Steven Seagal naming a movie as because he thinks it sounds cool.
say6gKB8mro,"As someone who grew up in the same kind of neighborhood Banks grew up in: he's playing dumb on purpose and he pays way more attention to politics than he admits. 

I've heard all of his talking points on local Sinclair radio stations all year long from guys like Sean Hannity.

You ain't that slick, Rick."
say6gKB8mro,"Hasan did a great job, I will say. He kinda just lectured him a lot and didn't let him speak as much. Which often doesn't get through to others"
say6gKB8mro,How tf are these people rich and famous wtf is wrong with people
say6gKB8mro,"“Hold on, im going to talk to him directly.” That’s why I watch you bruh"
say6gKB8mro,Im starting to think trump is gonna win. This man has like all the young voters
say6gKB8mro,I made it 7 minutes in and I can't listen to Faze dude anymore
say6gKB8mro,"It’s good to hear from a coherent trump supported because so many can’t actually explain why they’re voting for him. However, faze is peak trump supporter. Reasons for voting Trump: Hypocrisy of the left, even though trump is hypocritical as well. The classic issue, he’s a voter misguided by misinformation. And the most significant catalyst, he genuinely believes Trump is a victim. It’s like Trump hasn’t brought any critique on to himself and someone can’t criticize him without becoming a villain in the process. Hasan def. took it easy on him because they’re friends but this is the type of reasoning he often screams at when reacting to something."
say6gKB8mro,“Zero sum game” must be this morons term of the week
say6gKB8mro,Banks just comes off as a moron. No surprise.
say6gKB8mro,This guy is a moron
say6gKB8mro,Joe Rogan and Jill Stein voters are gonna get Trump back in office
say6gKB8mro,You do need ID or a SS number to register to vote in California.
say6gKB8mro,That dude is super hyper dumbo
say6gKB8mro,"I understand Hasan’s viewpoint in having normal relationships with friends and family who, while not completely crazy, are still trump voters. But I think that when a close friends of yours, in this case Banks, shows how ignorant they are and don’t mind voting for someone like trump; how do you continue to speak and be friendly to someone like that. This entire convo is Banks asking Hasan “do you think democrats were to mean to trump” and “trump was the best president of our timeline”. Genuinely I wouldn’t be able to associate and be empathetic to someone as dumb and blind like this idiot is."
say6gKB8mro,"Man, political powerhouses Elon Musk and Joe Rogan…

Also, asserting that someone is trying to protect free speech when they've literally banned numerous people on his platform for speech he doesn't agree with is hilarious.

“Free speech” doesn't apply to private businesses…"
say6gKB8mro,If Hassan is so smart and right. Why does he give the most dumb examples of Xs free speech violations? Get a better argument dude… crying about Elon not liking his flight records for his kids posted publically. You’d think there’s better examples other than twitter isn’t a left wing misinformation platform anymore. Y’all are so cringe if you don’t hate watch this guy. Enjoy the draft if Kamala wins youngans.
say6gKB8mro,i'm sorry we let this masshole escape to a state where his vote counts. Our institute coursers have been putting all of their resources into trying to retrieve Jill Stein.
say6gKB8mro,I can't believe banks is my age but talks like he's got a 7th grade education... I'm guessing this dudes audience broadly is 15 which is weird for so many reasons.
say6gKB8mro,Dude is definitely a racist. lol I care about immigration. Foh
say6gKB8mro,Why is Hasan lying to this guy. Trump is the worst president in history
say6gKB8mro,"'Trump was demonized'.  Yeah, he's a demon.  'They called him racist'...  Because he's a racist.  If you don't care enough to know anything about it, then stfu, keep your endorsements to yourself, and mind your own business.  If you're that ignorant, why should anyone care what you have to say on the subject?"
say6gKB8mro,I have several men in my life who sound EXACTLY like Faze and I wish I had an ounce of the communication skill and patience to talk them off the ledge.
say6gKB8mro,Wait the guy who ran an online casino for teens and manipulated his audience into gambling their house away is a bad guy?
say6gKB8mro,"faze blanks living up to his name, nothing going on in there."
say6gKB8mro,Ngl I don’t understand why he couldn’t stay apolitical and keep his mouth shut this election too
say6gKB8mro,Never rlly liked the dumb butt anyway
say6gKB8mro,"I hate dumb people like that dude. Literally they are like dumb male Paris Hilton IQ dudes that support some conman blindly, like Justin Bieber 2000  cult fans"
say6gKB8mro,Garbage
say6gKB8mro,"""im socially left leaning and echonomically centrist"" vote for Trump..."
say6gKB8mro,Crazy how all of a sudden he cares so much about politics
say6gKB8mro,"his whole politiacal reasoning is ""the blue hair people are mean to him"""
say6gKB8mro,Third party!
say6gKB8mro,Faze Banks is such a joke
say6gKB8mro,Im blocked here but fug it .. The housing collapse started with Clinton / Greenspan  policies .. very easy to verify
say6gKB8mro,"The guy is against Inflation and Pro Border security... both things that the current and ESPECIALLY potential Harris administration fight for, while Trump made inflation worse during his presidency and killed a border bill that would've made the border safer earlier this year... I'm honestly starting to wonder what goes on in the heads of people like him..."
say6gKB8mro,He’s never getting that chain is he 😅
say6gKB8mro,"I'm just confused how any immigrant is personally affecting any of these white people's lives, who own a business, are rich, not even around new citizens, or the public often. Like how is it affecting you at all. Because they're annoying to look at? Quickly. Answer."
say6gKB8mro,Who?
say6gKB8mro,This was so infuriating to listen to. Kudos to hasan's patience and calm explanations. It's clear there was no changing this guy's mind. He's going by vibes basically.
say6gKB8mro,"have we considered that bros just don't want to vote for a woman they don't want to Ef or get grandma'd by, and miserably this ends up validating the arguments from the shidlib Harris /Hillary fishbowl.  Just jump on that see-saw my dude.  The white male insecurity rationalization la-la-la could cover an entire suburbs worth of discarded Pelotons."
say6gKB8mro,"faze blanks is actually so dumb, i love when people call him out for the low iq frat boy he is"
say6gKB8mro,"He posted Donny and endorsed him when he was ""shot"", mere days after a friend of his was outed and harassed. People like these are uneducated/ignorant and proud."
say6gKB8mro,Wow. Hasan handled this well
say6gKB8mro,Thanks for showing that DT voters really do have 💩 for 🧠’s
say6gKB8mro,"never thought Banks would be a “smart” person, but holy sh!t"
say6gKB8mro,"Dudes concerned about ""cancel culture"" wonder if he had any issues with those rightwing maga  psychos who were assaulting Target workers over pride products. Literal terrorists.

These type of mfs are so fake."
say6gKB8mro,"first thought is, who is faze banks."
say6gKB8mro,9:13 this is as much stupidity as I could suffer through lol
say6gKB8mro,Oh my.
say6gKB8mro,Never listen to anyone’s opinion that shaves the middle part of their mustache
say6gKB8mro,hasan being friends with faze is such an L
say6gKB8mro,do people just forget that 2008 was the biggest recession in us history since the great depression?
say6gKB8mro,Coming on to Hasans stream to justify a Trump vote is wild.
say6gKB8mro,So if California is so rich why does the downtowns looks like a dumpster?
say6gKB8mro,This is your brain on twitter
say6gKB8mro,The guy literally admits that Trump is a racist at the jump then cries that Trump gets called a racist as if it's made up.
say6gKB8mro,"I have so many friends like this. Dude, who think they're like not liberals. He admits that he did not like trumps. Immigrant and border like rhetoric in the beginning. But now agrees with it, but has a problem with the democrats. Because they also agree with it because they're just desperate to seem in the middle like. These are just two equal opposing forces on the left and the right. It's so dumb, America has been failing everyone of us"
say6gKB8mro,"I’m sorry I don’t mean to comment bomb this fucking clip
The way about Kamala Harris has a chance to become president?

Trump was a Game show host. He’s a billionaire son."
say6gKB8mro,And your heads hurt because you haven't used your brain in a long time!
say6gKB8mro,Are in an abusive relationship! You identify with your abuser!🇱🇷💯😥
say6gKB8mro,That woman is demonized it is true every Christian and Pastor around the world and all believers know that! 🔥😡💯🇱🇷 In all Prophets Jewish prophets and all that know the Revelation in the Bible call her the daughter of lies but because you don't have any discernment judge of character you are blind and easily influenced like being in a cult! 😡🔥🙏
say6gKB8mro,"You all are clueless God have mercy on you! Voting against a regime that is Ungodly,denies the Lord and Mocks God! You will all be held accountable one day! That is truth 🔥 b**** you are easily swayed and believe the lies so self-deceived turn on basement light about anything Kathleen Carmelo just steals and copies severe narcissistic you are not listening no and listening it looks for Trump it's called lazy brain sloth a deadly sin! 🔥💯🇱🇷"
say6gKB8mro,"Respectfully, why is this Moron your friend? You don’t even know him well enough to discuss politics with him, and somehow he’s your “friend?” Throughout this entire conversation Faze Banks demonstrates how little he cares for what Hasan has to say. He comes off good faith, but respects Hasan’s opinion so little that he doesn’t even have the most basic grasp of leftist politics, and has clearly never had an interest in doing so. What a great “friend.”"
say6gKB8mro,Yes.....Lincoln was killed because he was an atypical politician.....
say6gKB8mro,Well this was enraging
say6gKB8mro,"we were talking about this in class and my professor brought up a book called Doppelgänger by Naomi Klein, which talks about how leftist turn right wing by using issues democrats haven’t really addressed and flip it around to make it seem like they’re the ones who could address these issues (while they actually never do)"
say6gKB8mro,just lying in this day and age is so effective. it doesn't matter what facts or data says about a topic. as long as it feels true it may as well be. people are primed everyone is lying so they just assume that there is an counter lie on the other side with its own cherry-picked data that they dont like
say6gKB8mro,"It’s just so impressive that right wing media can brainwash people this well

Banks at the end knows that he sounds dumb to people who are educated on both sides of the spectrum, but yet he doesn’t care"
say6gKB8mro,"the best trumpets, most both-sidesiest are those that try hardest to pretend they used to be progressive."
say6gKB8mro,I don’t have a issue with the politically normies but I do have an issue with them having a political opinion about they are not informed on. I understand I was once that normie too.
say6gKB8mro,"Faze: ""I will boat por Don all Tadonk."""
say6gKB8mro,A gigantic coke head with no talent that only hires cheating streamers for his cult clan is now voting for trump 💀
say6gKB8mro,why is this shocking its faze banks dude
say6gKB8mro,"Amazing how every election cycle, the Right whips up their base with the fear of migrant hordes of dark skinned savages invading our country (and women) and then the minute the polls close, they ghost on the subject and the world doesn't end. How many times are people going to fall for this ruse/grift."
say6gKB8mro,"Hasan drops a fact, 
little dude: well I don't kno & I don't care about all that.
little dude at the end: thanks for not barkin at me for being wrong & strong 

😂🤡🗳🌊🇺🇸🩵"
say6gKB8mro,why did hasan call him over this whole thing seemed i checked out like 2 minutes in like why? love hasan just a really weird choice to do this.
say6gKB8mro,Well at least only children(non-voters) and man-children(also not voters) watch Faze.
say6gKB8mro,The goal post got shifted and shifted without him acknowledging one point
say6gKB8mro,"Trump campaign is going all out to pay for these last minute endorsements.

The moment RFK said he would be in charge of health and education, I was sold."
say6gKB8mro,"If illegal migrants can vote, wouldnt anyone be able to vote infinite amount of times??? I’m really not following the logic it’s wildddd"
say6gKB8mro,"Sad to see but not surprised. Dude doesn’t even care yet holds all the wrong hands, red pill is unfortunately the default setting, extreme social conditioning. I swear the mass majority just looks at the outcome of our country as a football game, that they care less about than a parlay."
say6gKB8mro,People say they don’t pay attention to politics as an excuse for voting for Trump when they know they just want to take all republican talking points at face value and not go through the trouble of actually fact checking his nonsense.
say6gKB8mro,Who is faze banks and why should I care?
say6gKB8mro,"Hasan showed an incredible amount of restraint and patience for this discussion.  I just honestly couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It’s always the same for.Trumpsters, you can provide an endless amount of evidence to back up your claims, and all they will follow with is “well that’s not how I feel, or that’s not what I have seen.”  it is infuriating and makes me feel like you shouldn’t be allowed to vote unless you have at least the slightest clue for what each side has for their agenda."
say6gKB8mro,lol who
say6gKB8mro,Thank god they banned VanossGaming from being in their club.
say6gKB8mro,"Trump had North and South Korea getting along, Now they are really close to war, North just bombed a road to South, Cutting off all talks..

Russia took land under Obama, Kamala/Biden, and I think Clinton not sure, They didn't take any under Trump..

China was playing ball with us with Trump, Now they are very close to going after Taiwan.. 

Iran got 100 billion from the USA unlocked under Kamala/Biden, So they can fund the terrorist groups and buy missiles..

Then Kamala/Biden, Turn around and send over 200 billion to Ukraine, And Israel, So Israel can do that to the Middle East..

Mark my words, If Harris wins, We will have at minimum US troops dragged into at least 1 war, At worst WW3. Gas, Food, Rent, Goods, will skyrocket, Civilization will collapse.."
say6gKB8mro,The largest expansion of the middle class occurred when Elons tax rate was 90% and unions were strong
say6gKB8mro,Online 🧠 on full Display.  Dumb ass
say6gKB8mro,Who is face banks?
say6gKB8mro,"You guys are so cringe, relax take a breather. Stop talking for hasan, stop talking like you’re hasan, just let him talk to his friends. Stop being parasocial, i promise it’s not that serious. If anything, try to convince your trumper parents that they shouldn’t vote for trump"
say6gKB8mro,Just rig everything endorses Kamala https://youtu.be/nZftVjs-JdY?si=ftspFUsYZ3J0y0SB
say6gKB8mro,"It’s blowing my mind that he thinks Trump launching his whole campaign based on Mexican criminals coming in hordes so we need to build a giant wall across the whole border that Mexico will pay for is the same thing as Harris saying the border should be secure. She wasn’t saying border security was racist, she was pointing out the fascist rhetoric. It’s like he’s purposefully nitpicking Harris and using it to endorse someone far worse in every area. Bizarre."
say6gKB8mro,hasan kissing his friend's ass. phaze is what happens when you surround yourself with yes men and people who look like you. he has no excuse he has the resources to learn the facts.
say6gKB8mro,so they don't like hearing that trump is bad. well you're supposed to take that information and change your opinion instead of being crybaby banks
say6gKB8mro,Victimizing Trump is CRAZZZYY. ✌🏽FAZE
say6gKB8mro,This guy is an idiot
say6gKB8mro,hasan was right.
say6gKB8mro,"“California is trash aesthetically” 
that’s why most aesthetic business is located in California"
say6gKB8mro,these people trump supporters are so dumb.
say6gKB8mro,everything fazebanks said was wrong. cool i'm glad he has a platform and millions. fuckin stupid. free housing NOW
say6gKB8mro,"California is a disaster lol, The only reason it's making so much, Is it's the biggest state in the richest country in the world."
say6gKB8mro,21:50 Faze immediately jumps to the “Both sides are bad” when confronted with a simple example. He’s cooked.
say6gKB8mro,classic nothing matters so leave it as is.
say6gKB8mro,"Biden's chip act i think was bad for musk n biden's general china policy

I disagree with Trump's border policy but I'm endorsing. Trump because the democrats are hypocrites about it"
say6gKB8mro,"people like Banks aren't going to reciprocate political language, you need to break it down even further for them to understand"
say6gKB8mro,"Bro spends nearly 60 minutes gaslighting himself. This could have been 5 minutes and all my dude would have had to say was “Yes, I’m a greedy little paypig. I’m only voting for daddy Trump cuz he’s gonna give me and my dipshit millionaire gambling g*mer pals a massive tax cut.”"
say6gKB8mro,"Big lie, Illegal immigrants do take more tax money than they bring in, Most work under the table, So they only pay sales taxes, And they do get free medical, The Haitians get even more, They get free medical, Housing, Food, Money from the government."
say6gKB8mro,"Can you please stop using the beeps it is very annoying, can you please just mute instead of the beeps"
say6gKB8mro,Banks basically said he hates trump but will still vote for him. He’s shilling for repub-dollars
say6gKB8mro,Who is this goofy ass
say6gKB8mro,"I'm either on the left or in the center, but i'm voting for trump how psychotic We are so cooked, I have literally had this conversation with everyone I know I do not know how many times I'm 26 minutes into this video, and every time this dude brings app a point, and Hassan explains to him why he's wrong. He's just like ""well my feelings"" the vibes n the aesthetic of California is trash because of propaganda i see i no like. Zero clue of or care for reality, they don't want to be correct, they are not curious at all And I have no doubt that this guy's gonna get more irritated and aggressive as this conversation continues happening"
say6gKB8mro,Grifter.
say6gKB8mro,Faze does not know what an attorney general is come on
say6gKB8mro,"Hasan: explains how Donald Trump during his term destabilized the region in the Middle East, Abraham Accords, Golan Heights, Iran etc

Faze: Well, Joe Biden doesn’t know how to tie his shoes"
say6gKB8mro,guys ! what are the criteria you guys set to vote one over the other ?  do you go by facts and data or by character or both ?  genuine question .
say6gKB8mro,Oh god
say6gKB8mro,"This guys completely brain broken, Hasan is very patient."
say6gKB8mro,this is the average American. we're cooked

2jtJHakOC-E,Well i guess not. Looks like he's your daddy again!
2jtJHakOC-E,Guess that was no. Cope.
2jtJHakOC-E,I don’t get why people still listen to you.
2jtJHakOC-E,"Wow, this video did not age well eh?  By end Trumps career did you mean elect him president again by one of the largest landslide victories in our nations history?  This is a complete and definitive recection of liberal ideology.  Now learn about why you were completely rejected by America and try to become better people.  A good start would be not calling other people garbage who you disagree with.  Thanks for doing that though, you really helped Trump win decisively."
2jtJHakOC-E,"Nope he didn’t.
Reps like you loved it!!!"
2jtJHakOC-E,Yup. His campaign has been ended. Now time for him to clean up the garbage.
2jtJHakOC-E,"Answer to your question. No, he did not."
2jtJHakOC-E,Nope. He didn’t. We won!!!
2jtJHakOC-E,I strongly believe that Elon Musk and Joe Rogan gave Trump this election.
2jtJHakOC-E,"All aboard the Trump Train fellas!! Daddy is coming home, and he is ready to get to work for the American citizens (not everyone else)!!!🎉❤ 🚂"
2jtJHakOC-E,This didn’t age well.
2jtJHakOC-E,If people watching your show would just research  all the BS your showing they would know your  narratives have been lies. Just saying people think and research yourself.

Trump still beat her in the  state that the dems always win. They just didn't like her. Just like they didn't like Hillary. Both were just so disingenuous with their fake stories and racist accents.

2jtJHakOC-E,"Shave that disgusting stash pakman... rogan ended kamalas campaign when she was to much of a biotch to sit down with him for a long form interview, which of course she couldnt do"
2jtJHakOC-E,"Nazi style rally...

Really?

Gtfoh"
2jtJHakOC-E,😂😂😂
2jtJHakOC-E,"Lmfao so it’s okay when a comedian makes fun of other people, but not you. Got it."
2jtJHakOC-E,Parkman you suck
2jtJHakOC-E,lol pakman you’re fkd now brotha
2jtJHakOC-E,Let’s not forget George Lopez racist screed against Mexicans at the Harris events.
2jtJHakOC-E,This episode will not age well.
2jtJHakOC-E,That would be outstanding if you could track that.
2jtJHakOC-E,"Hey douchnugget, Rogan just endorsed Trump."
2jtJHakOC-E,This just in;  Rogan endorses Trump. MAGA!
2jtJHakOC-E,Rogan just endorsed TRUMP silly Willy
2jtJHakOC-E,"I'm a republican, but I will do my best to answer here. So she wanted certain conditions to be met with Joe Rogan which unfortunately he was not able to meet. Her campaign wouldn't be flexible or compromise with his schedule. Yes, Joe Rogan has endorsed Trump today. This will sway A LOT of Independent voters.I dont like Trump, I just don't like inflation and her campaign. Kamala seems cool but she had 3 years to fix it and 16 weeks to apologize and she didn't unfortunately. ""Word salad city"" as they call her....sorry."
2jtJHakOC-E,He Just endorsed Trump.
2jtJHakOC-E,Joe Rogan just ENDORSED TRUMP! you puppet
2jtJHakOC-E,Are you dumb? Did you know you look pathetic spreading fake news all the time? Btw Joe Rogan just endorsed Trump 😂🎉
2jtJHakOC-E,Leave it to this wimpy liberal tw3rp to think Rogan hurt Trump. I can’t believe he’s saying “nazi style rally”. How can anyone that says these things ever be credible again.
2jtJHakOC-E,Look. I don't agree with that joke but you and other democratic/liberal commentators are hitching your horse to the wrong wagon. It's a joke. Not gonna be helpful focusing in on it as much as many have been
2jtJHakOC-E,"I was pro Trump before this joke. This joke changed my entire life and now I’m voting for Harris. We have thousands of people like who who loved Trump before this joke. This joke changed our life for good…. It’s unfortunate because we have an open border, high inflation and poor WOKE policies but this joke changed me for good."
2jtJHakOC-E,"Granted it was bad joke. Never the less PR has a huge garbage/trash problem that no one was talking about in til now. Nothin disparaging was said about the Puerto Rican people, only they have a problem that fixing. Recently the EPA has filed a lawsuit and is suing PR."
2jtJHakOC-E,"This joke has brought more attention to Puerto Rico's garbage crisis, much like the 'people eating' comment brought attention to local communities and immigrant populations in Springfield, Ohio."
2jtJHakOC-E,Soyboy podcast. This weak guy is obviously not a Trump voter. Jealous of alphas
2jtJHakOC-E,"ahahahhahah!!!!! your grift act ends on tuesday, david :) get ready for an actual job afterwards."
2jtJHakOC-E,What a moron 😂
2jtJHakOC-E,This video aged terribly  .... hahahahahahaha rating are so amazing
2jtJHakOC-E,"We live in a country, that has too many people who don't think  before they speak. Who don't realize that our tongue is like a two edge sword. But then again this country is about to elect a Cheeto who has no filter."
2jtJHakOC-E,Dems gonna cry hard tomorrow 😂😂😂
2jtJHakOC-E,Harris is cooked and has been found to be a complete phony
2jtJHakOC-E,idk I thought he was funny
2jtJHakOC-E,"They appear to have given up advertising for Cruz and Trump in houston. Instead I am getting a ton of ads attacking democratic judges. 

Since I served on a jury where an innocent man was held in jail for 10 months because his bail was set too high, I'm a fan of Justice not ""hard on crime."""
2jtJHakOC-E,Joe Rogan is Balls Deep State.
2jtJHakOC-E,"Yeah, don't sleep on the part where Rogan is eager to have the top political candidate in a political party deliberately focus on shitting on people."
2jtJHakOC-E,"I wonder which candidate will win this Tuesday.   I am not thrilled about either candidate, but tend  to favor Trump."
2jtJHakOC-E,i love the funny drops from trump and alex jones and he's totally deadpan about it hahaha
2jtJHakOC-E,Your weird
2jtJHakOC-E,Volunteered for Kamala today 💪
2jtJHakOC-E,https://youtu.be/MeesTgYylmY?si=UqolQKf9DnkuN6Wz
2jtJHakOC-E,The delusion is unreal. You've reached cosmic levels of it.
2jtJHakOC-E,My favorite part is when he said that the democrat party looks like a Diddy party.😂.  Prove him wrong
2jtJHakOC-E,"You got destroyed on pierce morgon, lol. Wheres your upload? Lying pansie"
2jtJHakOC-E,"John Stewart just defended this dick and I would like to know when some of these comedians are going to stop enabling these lowlifes like Hinchcliffe, Chris Rock and Lois C.K. whenever they screw up and make damn fools of themselves?"
2jtJHakOC-E,Joe Rogan did not say having Tony Hinchcliffe at Trump rally was a good idea. He actually said the opposite
2jtJHakOC-E,Joe Rogan did not say having Tony Hinchcliffe at Trump rally was a good idea. He actually said the opposite
2jtJHakOC-E,"If someone is not funny, it is Tony."
2jtJHakOC-E,That's it. Joe Rogan is a loser.
2jtJHakOC-E,This same comedian cracked a cotton picking joke about Kevin Hart at the roast of Tom Brady and no one cared. Stop using us “POC” for votes and what is and what isn’t racist every 4 years
2jtJHakOC-E,Im sick to my stomach.  🤢
2jtJHakOC-E,"Liberalism really is a mental disorder. It is so insidious, so destructive. Only a mentally compromised person could make this comedian joke gone wrong a big deal…it’s a joke."
2jtJHakOC-E,"Wow, blowing up an environmental joke of a roaster comedian and forcing it as racism on Trump vs a sitting president actually saying something out of malice. Great way of thinking."
2jtJHakOC-E,"Dream on David, you’re away with the fairies!"
2jtJHakOC-E,"David PAC-man needs to get off the microphone.
He’s very boring.

I think he will be better when Trump gets elected. He can comment on all the bad stuff Trump does.
💜"
2jtJHakOC-E,That is what I think. I’m Hispanic and I’ve watched Tony and I don’t have any problems with him or his show. I actually like Shane Gillis’ Trump impersonation. I just don’t feel it was the time and place to make those “jokes” and the Puerto Rico one was mean.
2jtJHakOC-E,The woke religion is killing satire in America
2jtJHakOC-E,Puerto Ricans are  the nicest people!!!
2jtJHakOC-E,Yes Puerto Ricans are high up on the Latino pecking order my grandfather from Spain is the highest and of course the lowest culture of all is Mexico second to Venezuela !🔥👎💯
2jtJHakOC-E,But there was a podcast with two with a lot of Puerto Ricans laughing saying that's what comedians do! Can I call that a low blow Trump usually has good sense about who to have Earnest campaign trail looks like he got too many catch against anti MAGA! His loss get rid of that guy
2jtJHakOC-E,"Trump is going to lose according to people who speak to ghosts, but he will win 2028"
2jtJHakOC-E,4 years of biden harris has been devastating to America.  How does anybody who is well informed actually believe kamala will fix her own 4 year disaster?
2jtJHakOC-E,Thanks Joe Rogan even if you didn’t mean to help Kamala you did
2jtJHakOC-E,This man is just a dick
2jtJHakOC-E,Nazi style rally? You are a madman....
2jtJHakOC-E,You serious bro???? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
2jtJHakOC-E,trump is a ped and agrees on abortion banns
2jtJHakOC-E,Just imagine Puerto Rico having such a big effect on the American election 😢😢
2jtJHakOC-E,So you’re calling Trump supporters that attended Nazis now? What happened to the campaign of Joy? It’s a campaign of Joke! Meanwhile your explanation for Joe’s garbage is lame. He said it!
2jtJHakOC-E,"No you dummy. Trump is just getting more popular as the days go on, and camel toe turns to dust , as trump leaves her in it. He’s leading in every swing state and E college vote ,and polls… So eat it all up , Trump is back baby❤"
2jtJHakOC-E,"Trump and Vance on Joe Rogan combined pushing +50 millions views, in less then a week..? People are definitely curious"
2jtJHakOC-E,"This is already old news:(
    Biden said something worse!"
2jtJHakOC-E,Donald Trump is totally unhinged and not capable of working a garbage truck.  Felon.
2jtJHakOC-E,"I don’t get it. If this is all true, how is it that Trump just keeps winning?"
2jtJHakOC-E,"David ""Bathhouse Boy"" Pakman shilling for the DNC and 0% votes Kamala, lol. Typical!!"
2jtJHakOC-E,Nope not at all.. youre a pansy liar
2jtJHakOC-E,Man hang in there- you're tired and I thought it was FUNNY- APARTMENT PROJECTIONS!!!  Good one !
2jtJHakOC-E,The way Pakman pronounces controversy is more controversial than the joke
2jtJHakOC-E,This is a fully unhinged level of bias.  I used to kinda like watching Pacman sometimes. This is some misanthropic energy.
2jtJHakOC-E,"I wish Kamala would have done the JRE, because to talk to her like a human being would have destroyed her campaign. But it would have been funny."
2jtJHakOC-E,"19k likes 

Wonder how many bots did that, and wonder how many dislikes 🤔"
2jtJHakOC-E,Kamala cant even sit down and talk for 3 hours ( without her special conditions being met ) trump did it
2jtJHakOC-E,Calling trump rally a nazi rally while wearing a Hitler mustache! 😂
2jtJHakOC-E,"If I went to a comedy club and paid to see this, it would comedy. But at a U.S. presidential election rally where racist generalization should be shunned, these jokes are dangerous to Puerto Ricans and our nation- LETS NOT NORMALIZE FACISM!"
2jtJHakOC-E,"""mean, vindictive, and xenophobic""

Just your average Kill Tony episode."
2jtJHakOC-E,"You now what’s laughable, Puerto Ricans being offended by a comedian that pokes fun at anyone and everyone including himself but they don’t seem to get offended with politicians from their own hometown who rob them, deceive them and politely treat them like 💩 in their face. And this is coming from someone who was born and raised in the states with Puerto Rican parents but is now living in PR. Trump didn’t say it, it was the comedian that said it & the “joke” wasn’t even funny. Trump says he loves Puerto Ricans and spoke highly of PR and even when he was here he treated all Puerto Ricans nicely. 
The truth is when you have a no talent man like Bad Bunny who sadly happens to be a Puerto Rican, singing vulgar and crappy music, a JLO that was girlfriend and friends with Sean Combs (Diddy) and we all know how she got started in her career, a Marc Anthony that was unfaithful to his first wife ended up with JLO and did the same to her, these are the types of celebrities that people lookup to because they are supposedly putting PR’s name on high 😒 THEY ARE NOT!!! It’s people like them that make PR look bad plus basically ALL POLITICIANS HERE are corrupt and liars. So PR you should be offended by everyone else that supposedly represents you and don’t do a good job at it, not this comedian that roasts everyone he knows or not knows, this is his job and what he gets paid to do. Just like Raymond Arrieta and all comedians from PR when they make fun of Jennifer Gonzalez and everyone else. So stop your crying and whining over a stupid fool who doesn’t even know how to make you laugh and get a life. There are worse things being said about Jesus Christ everyday and he has never been offended the way your taking this crappy joke today. GET OVER IT!!!"
2jtJHakOC-E,Hilariously laughing at the trump tards in these comments 😂😂😂
2jtJHakOC-E,"Interesting clickbait title.  Do you really think ""Did Joe Rogan just END Trump's campaign?"" has any truth to it whatsoever?  No lol... not even a little.  Its a common tactic to set the tone for a specific way of thinking or artificially take the steam out of someone who may or may not know better.  Trump will absolutely win.  Look at the polls gay boi.  You're grasping at straws and its obvious.  You're even worse than TYT and thats saying something."
2jtJHakOC-E,"Funny hiw you prove to be exactly what everybody expects. I havnt had a better laugh in months listening to your twisting of words, and not actually adressing any politics that got talked."
2jtJHakOC-E,Can’t believe you guys are still listening to Pakman 😂😂😂😂
2jtJHakOC-E,Trump 2024
2jtJHakOC-E,You are such a pussy.
2jtJHakOC-E,"It is always the same with these people. We somehow need to do away with all decorum and standards because it is holding s back, we just need someone to 'tell it like it is' without all that 'crybaby' stuff. But then 'telling it like it is', is always just being hateful and bigoted."
2jtJHakOC-E,"The news already reported that Harris won Pennsylvania, 5 days before the election!"
2jtJHakOC-E,"Did anyone notice that George Lopez jokes about Mexicans stealing at a Harris rally? Ok, nobody’s paying attention to a Harris rally. Hypocritical Liberal could be a new identification!"
2jtJHakOC-E,No lol. You’re kind of dumb
2jtJHakOC-E,"Whenever I feel sad about myself, I watch David Pakman to realize that I'm not the most pathetic, weak, spineless, excuse for a man on Earth.

This guy is PATHETIC!"
2jtJHakOC-E,42million views in 6 days 😂. Keep coping.
2jtJHakOC-E,JD will use the 25th within 6 months. He secretly hates Trump.
2jtJHakOC-E,Stop calling this guy a comedian he's not funny 😊
2jtJHakOC-E,"Joe Rogan made Trump stronger. But we may never know, cheating is rife in USA, blue might cheat"
2jtJHakOC-E,"Trump for President, god bless Trump, greetings from Germany 🍀"
2jtJHakOC-E,Jesus #1
2jtJHakOC-E,You start with NAZI STYLE RALLY?!?!hahahaha then try to call Trump and his supporters racist?? STG the left are the definition of hypocrite
2jtJHakOC-E,Im gonna laugh in your face when Kamala gets fired 😂
2jtJHakOC-E,Trump 2024 that is how i voted
2jtJHakOC-E,"Didn't john Stewart back the comedian, too.. and didn't joe Biden just call all maga garbage? This is such a reach  David. 😅"
2jtJHakOC-E,Idiot
2jtJHakOC-E,"I don't know Joe Rogan. So, he's a racist too. ""Write a one liner about all these f...ng people""."
2jtJHakOC-E,Let me save you guys time ………no he didn’t he actually boosted the numbers . There .
2jtJHakOC-E,You suk demi ballz girly man
2jtJHakOC-E,"Trumps not going to lose, too many people cant stand these last 4 years"
2jtJHakOC-E,No. He didn’t.
2jtJHakOC-E,Nazi style?
2jtJHakOC-E,EVERYONE vote BLUE
2jtJHakOC-E,"I kinda think Joe set trump up on purpose, or that’s what I’d like to believe as somebody that used to enjoy the podcast"
2jtJHakOC-E,"The comment section here is pretty interesting, everybody's fkg triggered about the Puerto Rico thing when : 
It's a joke
It's something based on real issue 
Idk just seems weird to me when did the sense of humour disappear"
2jtJHakOC-E,"As a Puerto Rican I am voting for Tump! Enough with democrats propaganda, censorship and woke poltics. The world is on fire because of democrats policies."
2jtJHakOC-E,"1:07 Way off. Joe specifically told Tony not to do the rally (stated in his podcast) and even more specifically, not to do the Puerto Rico joke. Baron is a fan of all these right-leaning comedy podcasts that Trump has done: Flagrant, Theo Von, and Rogan. There is a good chance he’s a fan of Kill Tony too. Further, Tony and Joe are friends with Dana White. If you saw the Netflix Roast of Tom Brady, you saw Tony and Dana together. That’s because Tony wrote Dana’s jokes for the Roast. The smart money is that Dana suggested Tony. Maybe that Baron (or Don Jr) is plugged into the Rogan-sphere. JD Vance mentioned on Tim Dillon’s podcast that DTJr set it up. Anyway, Joe was talking about bringing Tony and Shane in as speech writers to punch them up with jokes in the clip you showed, as you well know. By the way, I’m all saying this as Trump hater and a Kamala voter. I just hate all of this bs lying and spinning. Anyone with a brain knows this will not make a dent in the election. The best thing Kamala could have done would be go on Joe, Theo, and Tim’s podcasts and be a normal, relatable person. They have way more viewers than Fox and CNN and, unlike those networks, the podcast viewers are mostly independents and in the middle."
2jtJHakOC-E,Im Puerto Rican and some bad jokes arent going to make people that were going to vote for Trump not vote for him yall desperate 😂😂😂 Viva Trump!!!
2jtJHakOC-E,Vote Blue!!! 💙💙💙
2jtJHakOC-E,"It's crazy, with all the high dollar investment property Trump has owned in his life, you people still continue to just let him live in your head without paying rent"
2jtJHakOC-E,"Lopez tells a joke about Mexicans stealing building materials for the wall at the DNC and you all laugh. Hitchclief tells the P.R. joke and you all lose your shit.  Pretty funny to watch actually.  Here’s a cheat sheet for all you dickless liberals on here.  Puerto Rico’s an island.  They have a landfill / trash disposal problem…There’s garbage everywhere.  
So to all the men on here who fail to possess a pair of balls,  quit being a bunch of whiny little bitches and talk about something else, because you look ridiculous."
2jtJHakOC-E,Trump is toast and Tony's Hinchcliffe's career is launched 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
2jtJHakOC-E,"0:23 So Trump is ""nazi"" even tho he supports Israel? Your buzzwords ain't working."
2jtJHakOC-E,"Save everyone the suspense. 
NOPE"
2jtJHakOC-E,"Sigh, aaaaaah..... isn't it wonderful, owning a video podcast & not conceiving anyone other than your most loyal and diehard fans will ever see it...??😄😏"
2jtJHakOC-E,I guess no one will be watching you soon
2jtJHakOC-E,"I'm Puerto Rican and actually laughed out loud at the joke. He's a comedian, its a joke!!!

We are never going to move forward as a nation if we are offended at every little thing that is said in good humour. 

My friends and I make fun of each other all the time, it's a sign of affection.

Stop trying to control what people are allowed to say. It isn't a power any government should ever have over a true democracy.

As Bobby Kennedy says... A government that can suppress free speech has a licence to commit any atrocity. 

If you can't see the atrocities the current administration have commited and are currently commiting, I pray for you. 

Trump 2024 🇺🇲 🦅"
2jtJHakOC-E,It is a joke my man it wasnt that funny but why are you getting so butt hurt over a joke
2jtJHakOC-E,"I personally give comedians a pass on indecency when on stage. Especially one who specializes in roasts. Sure it was in poor taste, and not the best place to use a joke like that, but in the end, it was just a roasting comedian telling an indecent joke. I highly doubt it's his true view on Puerto Rico or racist in any way."
2jtJHakOC-E,Reeee reeeeee😂 trump 2024❤❤
2jtJHakOC-E,No. Hope this helps.
2jtJHakOC-E,Can’t wait to watch you meltdown little man
2jtJHakOC-E,Chat full of brain washed folks. We feel really bad for you all. God bless you.
2jtJHakOC-E,No. It was a joke.....by a comedian.....
2jtJHakOC-E,"Great interview with joe rogan, I really liked it. For every trump hater, just watch the episode as a source of entertainment, great I swear"
2jtJHakOC-E,There is people called comedians that make jokes.  I thought it was hilarious because it was a joke.
2jtJHakOC-E,Trump clearly answered his questions and they got along great/ laughed the whole time. What is up with the fake click bait? Joe Rogan actually made fun of cnn and liberals and called Kamala a gypsy 🤣
YcgMeIK0KOY,"I wrote a book! ""The Echo Machine: How Right-Wing Extremism Created a Post-Truth America."" It's available on March 25th, 2025. Pre-order it here: https://davidpakman.com/echo"

YcgMeIK0KOY,Thank you.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Trump's hate speech is an homage to Satan. Need I say more about where his faith lies?
YcgMeIK0KOY,How VERY Enlightening.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"The crackpot , lunatics and nut jobs are all ready to be part of Trump's admin. Can hardly wait. 
As long as Kelly Ann Conjob stays home."
YcgMeIK0KOY,Paula White….complete bat crazy. It’s amazing that some people respect a woman who needs mental help.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Very sad indeed. It's hard to imagine people believed his routine of montizing religions
YcgMeIK0KOY,This is heresy...this is not Christianity. This is some kind of aberration; a bastardization of Christianity. Most people are deceived because they don't read their bible and don't study it rigorously. This is why we find ourselves here in America.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Anyone who voted for him is insane.  That makes no sense why anyone would vote for their freedoms to go and live in total strife every day.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Deflect, deflect, deflect…"
YcgMeIK0KOY,Wacko!!!
YcgMeIK0KOY,What a fckin nutbar! This is what is wrong with the US.
YcgMeIK0KOY,….. hahahahaha … only in America …….
YcgMeIK0KOY,Stop judging.. They're both Christians..
YcgMeIK0KOY,She's a complete barmpot.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Like a woman has power in church.  Hell bound Christian nationalist.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"please stop reporting on this God garbage. It all distracts from reality.

YcgMeIK0KOY,Great post - so damn funny:)
YcgMeIK0KOY,"David, when is it cool to make fun of someone ? Is it when it doesn’t align with your beliefs? You are a clown bro."
YcgMeIK0KOY,Show me one person she has ever helped
YcgMeIK0KOY,"poor Davey, still crying....😿"
YcgMeIK0KOY,These SNL skits are getting more and more elaborate.
YcgMeIK0KOY,When Trump doesn't want to answer a question he does dance around it with out really answering the question ❓.😊
YcgMeIK0KOY,You look like you take dick with no lube
YcgMeIK0KOY,"David, you are done. Exposed as a racist bigot."
YcgMeIK0KOY,Amen is right. These people are from another planet. They are totally nuts. Trump should be in an old age home because he is senile
YcgMeIK0KOY,Paula White is an ass. What a fool she is makkng of herstlf.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Unfortunately we are going to have to deal with 4 more grueling godless years of evil dictatorship.  Congratulations, Americans. Yall elected a self-proclaimed dictator. He's not MY president I didn't vote for that scumbag"
YcgMeIK0KOY,Trump will just change the subject if he doesn’t have an answer and he’s too lazy and narcissistic to take the time and even think about the question….🕺🏻🌬️
YcgMeIK0KOY,Ese hombre está loco. ¿Cómo carajos ganó?????
YcgMeIK0KOY,Looks like VOODOO!!! 🤡
YcgMeIK0KOY,Good luck USA …. 😂😂😂
YcgMeIK0KOY,Answer the question
YcgMeIK0KOY,The Bible means nothing to me.  Just a silly book full of nonsense
YcgMeIK0KOY,Sounds like phonics video for 2nd graders. Mentally deranged
YcgMeIK0KOY,What bible are these ppl reading? Does it have an upside down cross? Cause they certainly aren’t following the teachings of Jesus.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Also. Ever notice how grifters stick together?
YcgMeIK0KOY,Why was it okay for him to go into a teen beauty pageant???
YcgMeIK0KOY,Trump needs to go into prison in the white house. Christians need to pray for a world that denies that we are born male and female. It is not transphobia to say so.
YcgMeIK0KOY,I hear the sound of a crazy lady.
YcgMeIK0KOY,and i thought trump was a deranged monkey
YcgMeIK0KOY,Just another Cult - yet again! Where they at ? Down south somewhere......oh yeah Georgia .....Now that's a surprise !!! Smh!  Totally Cringe worthy ya know like fingernails on a chalkboard !

YcgMeIK0KOY,David Pakman ..I’m not sure who your mother is but she’s a religious lunatic as well ! 😅 enjoy your day !
YcgMeIK0KOY,😅😅😅😅
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Maybe if y’all could define what a woman is, a woman would have won 😂"
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Dave you said on your show that it would be hard to imagine Trump blowing Kamala out. Biggest blowout in history. No wonder you’re losing subscribers, you’re crazy"
YcgMeIK0KOY,People like you is why Trump won
YcgMeIK0KOY,David you like to put people in pigeonholed  why you will fail.  You have no soul.
YcgMeIK0KOY,God loves everone. He is d story teller   No it means helping others.
YcgMeIK0KOY,How dare you mock.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Clear you are satanic David.  Bye.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Oh gosh, these fear mongering, hate spreading  channels are a major reason why the majority of citizens got so sick of the left rhetoric .  Thank you for being so incredibly hateful and intolerant.  People couldn't run faster to vote for Trump. 😂"
YcgMeIK0KOY,Loser
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Is it still ""funny""? Or has reality set in. How did this ignorant ass get followers?"
YcgMeIK0KOY,Biden should demand that Trump is diagnosed by at least 3 or more real doctors to make sure he is fit mentally to be president
YcgMeIK0KOY,Biden has to stop being so gentlemanly and take him on force the doj to do its job
YcgMeIK0KOY,Elon Musk should be deported because his first visa was a tourist visa and just never left
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Old Paula probably continually fantasizes about large, well-hung Republican men."
YcgMeIK0KOY,Stop lying! It’s not cool. This is the reason why you are now losing subscribers.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Sorry to be late in thanking you David Packman. Your videos have been so encouraging through this whole horrible process of election of this past year I’ve seen Donald Trump and his immoral ways and fighting against it. Though we lost a political battle we will keep fighting for the people who matter and care about other people. Jesus did not make any distinguishing between any  peoples... he did not come into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him who loved everyone may be saved from hate Towards each other and realize we all need a savior. Only one did that and it wasn’t Donald Trump it was Jesus Christ the son of God. Thank you again keep up the good work !
YcgMeIK0KOY,Jewish folks are insane aswell david
YcgMeIK0KOY,"wow, that woman is a phenomenal nut case, hyper irritating to watch and hear."
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Mom's message to Trump:
SIT UP, YOU SCHLUMP! SLOPPY LOOK! DO YOU WATCH THESE TV BITS????"
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Paula White is such a con, she even conned Trump."
YcgMeIK0KOY,This is sick! God help America alright! They are as fundamentalist as Muslims!
YcgMeIK0KOY,"David Pakman, you are acting foolish. But I forgive you because you don’t actually know what you’re doing, you are actually fighting God and you don’t seem to know it. I really feel sorry for you. Hopefully your eyes will open when Trump has won, but somehow I don’t think so. God have mercy on you. I am praying for you."
YcgMeIK0KOY,And this is who Jon Cain from Journey?  He married it! 😂Good lord. 😂
YcgMeIK0KOY,SHE IS A CON ARTIST
YcgMeIK0KOY,What a crock of shit. Morons ar their best .
YcgMeIK0KOY,Yeah faith to him is worshiping at the alter of the almighty dollar.  Just look at the RNC it started off worshiping at the alter of the almighty dollar and ended with praying to their golden calf.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Never answers a question!  What else is new?
YcgMeIK0KOY,What he does is give them compliments first because people like hearing about themselves and will forget the question themselves.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"A very demure, a very mindful question 😂"
YcgMeIK0KOY,The only thing that flopped was kamala harris losing the popular vote! Democrats maybe next time try a canadate that can actual talk and not need a teleprompter
YcgMeIK0KOY,i wonder if he ever grabbed her by the pussy?
YcgMeIK0KOY,"AND YES, IDIOT FOOL PAKMAN SWALLOWS!  THAT WHY HE HAS A ""ROUND MOUTH""  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

YcgMeIK0KOY,You guys fell for John Is God. All because your female god Oprah told you to.
YcgMeIK0KOY,You’re losing subscribers because you’re full of shit. You and the other media is the reason why Trump won. People aren’t believing your bullshit
YcgMeIK0KOY,David pakman is a lunatic you should probably get help for your TDS ISSUES
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Deranged propagandist,  Who lie and deflect and NEVER self examine! I pray you repent believe in Jesus Christ and be Saved!"
YcgMeIK0KOY,lol let’s let religion rules David. I think it’s more fun that way. It’s good to give people’s faith so it will keep people busy.
YcgMeIK0KOY,YOU ARE A FRAUD DAVID
YcgMeIK0KOY,He has fooled so many people....
YcgMeIK0KOY,Big flop huh 😂
YcgMeIK0KOY,Making fun of people’s religion is not a good idea. Guess what? This didn’t age well.
YcgMeIK0KOY,clearly it never flopped he won 🤪
YcgMeIK0KOY,"OK,I'd be out,listening to that person."
YcgMeIK0KOY,"HOW MUCH DID IT COST TRUMP TO PAY  YOU TO LIE TO ALL OF US DAVID?!? SHAME ON YOU FOR THE LIES EVERY DAY YOU ARE A ""TRUMP LOVING POS"
YcgMeIK0KOY,Trump spoke the truth.  His god is money.  There you go.

YcgMeIK0KOY,Tears.
YcgMeIK0KOY,David.... you're fired kunt
YcgMeIK0KOY,It didnt completely flop...it actually did very well and you were wrong like all the other bullshit you spread
YcgMeIK0KOY,Thank you Jesus. It is time to respect the MAGA movement and remove yourselves from the echo chamber.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"David, I quite like your programme, but I think it’s clear now that titles like this one just made people overconfident and gave Trump more opportunities to troll us all.  I had a bad feeling this would going to be the way it played out.

As you said months ago: you’ll probably be fine.  I’m sure you’ve got resources.  Lots of people, myself included, may see things like our healthcare or food-assistance options wither or even disappear.  What are we supposed to do about that?  

Again, I like you… but it doesn’t seem completely fair l now, that many of us have to potentially suffer so much more than you thanks possibly in part to your (admittedly attention-grabbing) upload titles.   Some real help would be appreciated, but I doubt you’ll even personally read this comment.  So many years of false hopes.  Thanks for nothing, I guess. 😢"
YcgMeIK0KOY,What I've just watched is nothing but insane and gross!  I'm afraid yours and my prayer hasn't been heard by 'the Lord' on this very sad 6th of november 🥲
YcgMeIK0KOY,PACK YOUR BAGS AND FARK OFF!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
YcgMeIK0KOY,how about you go over how Trump Won?😘
YcgMeIK0KOY,how about you go over how Trump Won?:)
YcgMeIK0KOY,Trump wins!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Not a flop, trump won.  I hate trump but your channel was nothing but the same BS as trump"
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Good Morning, left wing lunatic losers !!!  We have been unburdened by what has been !!  😂😂😂😂😂 Liberal losers suck !!"
YcgMeIK0KOY,"These religious zealots are disgusting, beyond stupid. pieces of s**t.,"
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Paula White is a . . . well the word starts with ""C"" and ends with ""T""."
YcgMeIK0KOY,"It is not “transphobia” to acknowledge that men and boys are inherently stronger than women and girls. Let’s not do this. We claim to be the party of science, yet we have collectively abandoned basic biology in favor of ideology. This is not even a controversial issue. Most people acknowledge that males should not be in women’s sports, even among democrats. Read the pew research. People say one thing in public, while they privately believe something else. Everyone is afraid of what the next person will think of them, meanwhile, the country is being made mess safe for women and girls. This is an inherently pseudoscientific, misogynistic, and homophobic ideology, and the left has embraced it regardless against all notions of common sense, because they’re afraid of what others will think of them. Well, sorry, but I’m not afraid. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 

Do these people not know that YMCA is a gay anthem? 🤔 😅"
YcgMeIK0KOY,"I love the guy who strolls back and forth behind her with no interest at all. Probably just thinking, ""Oh, she's off again"""
YcgMeIK0KOY,Christians who support Trump are beyond deluded. They are evil.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Why 😂😅😂😅VOTE BLUE 🗳 💙 😅😅😅😅
YcgMeIK0KOY,Example of total religious hypocrisy
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Im confused, is that a place of prayer and worship of a holy god? or is that just an ordinary business building?  Its rather comical to be transphobic and then join in a dance from the village people, a disco group that was Gay influenced strongly.  Dance on dance on .  Young man its fun 2 stay at the ymca"
YcgMeIK0KOY,How many of the Ten Commandments has Trump broke.... asking for a friend.
YcgMeIK0KOY,For one or two moments I'm sure I saw a guy from the local Nut House about to don his Lunatic Asylum White Coat to escort her off for some electro- convulsive treatment..... only to realise she was far to crazy and likely to upset the entire tranquility..so he hung it over his arm and left.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Absolute grifter just like Trump
YcgMeIK0KOY,Paula White played a major part in my young neighbors sui[ide. He was a Vet with PTSD and got deeply involved with her ministry.

YcgMeIK0KOY,"When she starts ""speaking in tongues"", she sounds like Cornholio from Beavis and Butthead."
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Matthew 7:20-24
""20 Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.
21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ 23 And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’""
WHAT IS FRUIT?
Galatians 5:22-23
""22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
DO YOU SEE ANY HOLY SPIRIT FRUIT IN DONALD J. TRUMP? 
I think you know the answer to this."
YcgMeIK0KOY,"She is not perfect, neither are you. So, stop judging people"
YcgMeIK0KOY,Paula is clown ass joke. As well
YcgMeIK0KOY,"I will never forget watching Trump,😢 at a large prayer breakfast. One of the ministers stood up at the end and said let us recite the Lord's Prayer and Trump did not have a clue what the words were. He tried to make his lips move to match the words but failed miserably. What Christian does not know the words to The Lord's Prayer?"
YcgMeIK0KOY,He chose YMCA as a nod to his mentor Roy Cohn.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Note that no white christians  condemn the attack on our capital.  Disgusting  liars on God.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Satan quotes scripture. Her doing so is absolutely  meaningless. Fake christians are clueless.
YcgMeIK0KOY,What a nut.

YcgMeIK0KOY,"""Religion is the glue that holds the country together.""

Similarly, the cancer is the glue that holds the body together."
YcgMeIK0KOY,Paula White is a very well known crank and grifter. She's been scamming the easiest possible target (republicans) for years now. Scamming republicans is like the tutorial of a game. If you can't achieve that.... wtf is wrong with you?
YcgMeIK0KOY,With all the prayers in 2020 he lost. That means you guys didn't pray enough. Now it's 2024. Don't pray. He will loose again'

YcgMeIK0KOY,Wow what a complete nutjob. And so is this woman. 😂
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Paula White and all her ilk on that stage are not Christians at all.
It reminds me of that part of Scripture that says God permitted a lying spirit to speak through the many prophets that were advising the king to go to a war he will definitely lose and in which he will be killed."
YcgMeIK0KOY,She is creepy. Phony. Moneychanger. Among other things..
YcgMeIK0KOY,"​​chatGPT: In summary, the commentary accurately reflects documented events and public discussions regarding Paula White's actions and Donald Trump's expressions of faith."
YcgMeIK0KOY,WTF
YcgMeIK0KOY,"He blames Islamism and criticizes the Mullah regime in Iran but still uses the same fanatic religious methods to mobilize stupid and close minded people for his very unchristian cause. If we allow our self’s to be a little bit religious and take the warnings seriously, then we should be aware of the antichrist who comes among the sheep pretending to be the savior."
YcgMeIK0KOY,"When trump hears that question being asked, he just hears the results of all the brainwashing he and his flying monkeys have been crafting coming right back to him, like it was supposed to do."
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Dems should rethink the trans sports issue. While it may not be as important as other issues, it's a complicated issue of fairness v participation and can make Dems lose elections."
YcgMeIK0KOY,SOOOO FUNNY HE USES Y.M.C.A.! GAY ANTHEM PERFORMED BY A GAY BAND.
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Hilarious that Trump uses God as a grift to say he was saved by the assassination attempt thanks to god, but fuck that other dude who actually died right?"
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Paula White isn't speaking in tongues, she is blowing s***..she needs a psychiatrist"
YcgMeIK0KOY,This devil needs a good f**k
YcgMeIK0KOY,Oh ... No religious or spiritual beliefs whatsoever. The only thing about him I can stand.
YcgMeIK0KOY,Yes he knew her for a long time he remember grabbing her by the pxxxy
YcgMeIK0KOY,From where this even was released ?
YcgMeIK0KOY,I hear that you are like a broken record
YcgMeIK0KOY,It’s David’s shock that they’re all touching Trump. It’s called laying on hands and it’s extremely common among Black Christians of most denominations. It doesn’t seem to be that popular among white Christians but I have no idea
YcgMeIK0KOY,Trump 2024!!!!!!!!!!!
YcgMeIK0KOY,Paula White is laughable
YcgMeIK0KOY,They are both insane!
YcgMeIK0KOY,"I hear the sound of the neighbors eating the cats, and eating the dogs, and eating the pets, of the people who live there, and rata tata tot, andtipee canoe and tyler too.  And sharks and electric boats and bigly wiggly woggly tump's big butt."
YcgMeIK0KOY,I am astonished at the level of stupidity 😖
YcgMeIK0KOY,"Trump is and has not been a churchgoer. He doesn’t have biblical knowledge at all!  I am a Christian, born again in my late teens. Have been raised in church all of my life. I’m in my 50’s now. I never knew of Trump as a churchgoer.  There’s literally no history of this. He may have  met Billy Graham back back then it was for publicity to win the election (back then) Videos of his past are with Jeff Epstein, Melania was a purchased sex model,  his past is astoundingly godless!   His is a fraud! Not one of us! He’s not a born again Christian! He’s not!"
YcgMeIK0KOY,Mass insanity happens.
YcgMeIK0KOY,I used to love  Paula White but she has gone left 😮😮😮
YcgMeIK0KOY,Did she like trump simulating oral s on live TV?

efh08sOTp-4,She wasted ONE BILLION DOLLARS !!
efh08sOTp-4,For everyone who voted for trump. May God have mercy on your souls. You are putting all of us true Americans. Through an unbelievable nightmare. This is the beginning of the end.
efh08sOTp-4,So disappointing that this is the outcome - WHAT are Americans thinking? Do they really still reject the idea of a female President (as some people commented in interviews post-results today)?!?!
efh08sOTp-4,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂is
efh08sOTp-4,"4:50 45 male presidents… Grover Cleveland served twice, as the 22nd and 24th president."
efh08sOTp-4,If you reversed things it would be the appropriate 90-10 split. The only thing Trump has going for him is being a white man
efh08sOTp-4,The only person I’ve heard talking about her be the first anything is Tucker Carlson when he was clearly high talking gibberish
efh08sOTp-4,"A SEX OFFENDER, RAPIST WHO WEARS DIAPERS DUE TO DRUG ADDICTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
efh08sOTp-4,Chump gets to be lawless while Kamala must be flawless.
efh08sOTp-4,"Wow!  Yes, grasshopper!  She is a bait dodging ninja. Whenever it is about her, Being a woman and the identity of  this person or that person or others. She pivots off of that superficial topic to substance issues of what she can do in her capability and achieving tangibles. Move away from tribalism to fax reasoning and substantive Convo.  Very sharp.  She moves away from a narrative that can hurt her and spins in around into one that would benefit her into an attack on Trump.  Chefs kiss! 😘 She might’ve cracked the code."
efh08sOTp-4,"Dpak is ignoring the polls on purpose. If he reports their results, he'll lose half his cult...😮"
efh08sOTp-4,Thank you for sharing this important information. 💯
efh08sOTp-4,"Yesterday a small family came up to me, all with tears in their eyes, and began hugging me. The father said, ""Thank you Sir for voting for Kamala Harris, we don't want to be mistakenly deported."" I replied, ""David Pakman will straighten this BS out."" Thanks for fighting the good fight David Sir. - Chris I."
efh08sOTp-4,Today is the day the Democratic party is no longer the party of the working class and middle class party...😎😎 they will be voting for Trump.......   Joe Bozo Biden and Word Salad have destroyed them..🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

efh08sOTp-4,"4:50 technically, only 45 men have been president. One of them was president twice non-sequentially"
efh08sOTp-4,"Yes men can be women, but Kamala wisely was asked a tough question she avoided. Maybe she’s a transphobe?"
efh08sOTp-4,Kamala is the embodiment of identity politics.
efh08sOTp-4,Can't wait to see David and his entire platform cry in the next few days.
efh08sOTp-4,Start the meltdown Mrs. Peepers.
efh08sOTp-4,Vote red
efh08sOTp-4,Kamala’s getting smarter by the day...jolly good show — wot?
efh08sOTp-4,"I wonder if david packman considers himself a beta, or a alpha male"
efh08sOTp-4,Thank God the campaign has taken this approach.
efh08sOTp-4,"To prove I’m not sexist, I’m voting for Kamala because she’s a woman."
efh08sOTp-4,Are you gonna talk about how you were wrong about that Olympic boxer being a women.
efh08sOTp-4,Farron David and Brian the three of you have kept me updated ever since trump announced his presidency you three where the only one I trust you guys made me get more into politics thank you

efh08sOTp-4,"Can you tell me, dear Americans, what the situation is like outside the polling stations in the USA? What is the mood like? I'm sitting here in Germany, filled with fear, and tonight at 01:00 AM German time, when the first polls close, I'll need a sedative to watch. I am aware that it will probably take a while for the results to come in, but I am hoping for a good result today. If you have not yet voted, please do so for your own sake, it is the highest good in a democracy."
efh08sOTp-4,Was telling my daughter today when she was 9 I took her with me to vote for Obama our 1st Black President. Tomorrow we're voting for Harrison our 1st female President God willing

efh08sOTp-4,"I HAVE CLASSIFIED NEWS FROM A CIA FRIEND, KAMALA HARRIS WILL WIN THE ELECTIONS, AT LEAST WE WON'T HAVE A HITLER RULING USA"
efh08sOTp-4,"DAVID. please add a video showing the contrast of crowd reaction to the end of Trumps last speech in Grand Rapids (not Detroit as Trump said last night) and Kamalas last speech in Philly. Even RSBM has not got his speech isolated yet, they have isolated speeches from all others from last night!!! RSBM has the full ~5hr video of all speeches up, but in order to not show how bad and short duration the crowd reaction was to his final words were, they cut the crowd audio from the video the exact second he turns away from the mic. From that point on, were only hear YMCA song without crowd sounds.  We see him plop down the steps as though he was praying he would not fall.  The thing he practiced most for this speech is dancing to YMCA... Trumps last words were 'Make America Great Again"", Kamalas were 'When We Fight'....  Trump has shown that he has no ability to self correct his next words (like Detroit) as he speaks while Kamala can! Watch her last night pre correct herself mid-word and say 8pm rather than 7pm for Pa's hours of voting today..."
efh08sOTp-4,I'm from the UK and Donald Trump is vile and exhausting. I'm done with American Politics after this cycle.
efh08sOTp-4,This is the kind of response one would NEVER hear from the tangerine toddler .
efh08sOTp-4,"Hey David, love your show. I appreciate everything you do. Just had a quick comment regarding the Elon Musk Joe Rogan interview. I don’t hear many people talking about the idea that if Trump is elected, he will appoint Elon Musk to some sort of government position, possibly a cabinet position. I realize that a lot of rules protecting the American taxpayer from conflict of interest of their politicians, we’re broken by the previous Trump administration, but I think it’s important to point out what Elon Musk could do if he has granted the power that Trump would likely grant him. Would America demand that he separates himself from his businesses so there aren’t direct conflicts of him influencing policy to his benefit. If he does that, we essentially sacrifice a very innovative person and business person to be a politician. I would rather see Elon Musk continue to invent stuff in the private sector than to be a politician. I think him being both is very dangerous and it needs to be pointed out to the American voter. Not sure if this makes sense but thinking about Elon Musk being the richest person in the world and what he’s involved in and have him in a position in the most powerful nation on earth seems like Sky net in the terminator. Imo"
efh08sOTp-4,the JD Vance shade takes me out 🤣
efh08sOTp-4,That’s the prosecutor in her. She knows how to answer tricky questions because she dishes them out all day.
efh08sOTp-4,Trump is gonna win. I´m enjoying sausages and MAGAronis today .. MAGA and Cheese like we Trump supporters say ..
efh08sOTp-4,I guess Kamala is cackling his way to victory!
efh08sOTp-4,🇺🇸💙🫡
efh08sOTp-4,She's got poise and grace that THEY don't. Duh.
efh08sOTp-4,I’m concerned that early voting turnout has been lower than 2020. That could favor the GOP.
efh08sOTp-4,"Go vote Trump, so you don't get drafted and die in the snow of UKR."

efh08sOTp-4,I'm British and I find it mind boggling that Trump is still running. I'm hoping Harris wins 🇬🇧💙🇺🇲

efh08sOTp-4,Jo Cox: (Late MP from West Yorkshire UK)  “we are far more  united and have more in common than that which divides  us” vote Kamala💙
efh08sOTp-4,"Hi David. Inevitable tensions. The US's entire history has been about social conflict. Trump is the Inevitable product of a country founded by ambitious white men and based on the principle of self interest. Kamala the Inevitable product of disperate people trying to find a place in the world that was created for them. The real question is not about difference it is about commonality. 'how do disperate people with different motivations find common ground ?' And in this case both candidates have focused on difference and neither candidate has made much attempt to find the common ground that unites people. The United States. United in a common purpose, not always agreeing but interdependent. My view. Trump is deliberately creating a divided country. Kamala is trying to play him at his own game. Unsuccessfully. She should have appealed to people's sense of shared identity."
efh08sOTp-4,"Why would anyone vote for her , saying she will raise taxes,  take our speech, take our guns  and leave the southern border open why vote for more terrror 4 years is enough 😮"
efh08sOTp-4,Is it because jd vance is to smart for you
efh08sOTp-4,FELLATING
efh08sOTp-4,"Weasel, weasel, if she cannot handle questions from CNN, how is she going to negotiate with world leaders? Ha ha, spin it, weasel. It’s what you do best!"
efh08sOTp-4,"So she has no diplomacy skills, huh? Got it, weasel?"
efh08sOTp-4,"She can not take the bait because it is just her thinking. She beliefs in these words, thinks in these very American way."
efh08sOTp-4,"Yes Sir CLOWN 🤡 SIR she "" rejects"" it. 😂😂😂😂We all reject it SIR 😂😂😂 you reject it😂😂😂❤❤❤"
efh08sOTp-4,Kamala Harris' interview skills got better and better.

efh08sOTp-4,"Come on, America. Dont fluff it up! 🤞🏼"
efh08sOTp-4,"2:30 funny David. Who were the people who were constantly making group identity the first and last argument about every issue? Who were the ones claiming that not wanting to apply social importance to gender and skin colour are in fact, racists and sexists? That colourblindness is evil and “all lives matter” is a Nazi slogan? It was not Trump and the republicans. At least own your identitarian obsession, folks."
efh08sOTp-4,"Best candidate for us to have given the fuckery we had to witness again and again (and sadly, President Biden's decline into old age)."
efh08sOTp-4,"Trump needs ifentity to be an issue, because his actual policies are idiotic, and he has to keep his cult looking the other way so they do not realise how bad he us at actual leadership."
efh08sOTp-4,the war between the empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu in Gulliver's Travels began over a disagreement about how to crack an egg
efh08sOTp-4,"If Harris wins it is not BECAUSE of her race and gender. It is IN SPITE of them, given how much MAGA tried to use them to prove her unfit to lead. Let's leave those attitudes in the 20th century and make a new norm for the 21st. Racial and gender equality is the future. Trump hates that. But he is on the wrong side of history. And when he is feeding worms, another victory against prejudice can be won."
efh08sOTp-4,We haven't gotten this much positivity from a politician in a while. It's very refreshing. she's so wholesome.
efh08sOTp-4,Kamala/Walz  has to win!
efh08sOTp-4,Wholesome Harris being wholesome
efh08sOTp-4,Ordered your book. 👍
efh08sOTp-4,JD Vance is that kind of person who is infexiously toxic. I'm perfectly ok with less coverage of that roach.
efh08sOTp-4,Man you sound so desperate everything to you is a gotcha but clearly not
efh08sOTp-4,Why is everyone that attended a Diddy’s party endorsing Kamala? I’m starting to believe this is a clan of elites and evil people. Luckily I have not voted and switching to Trump.
efh08sOTp-4,"Unfortunately, not all of us were financially literate early. I was 35 when I finally educated myself and started taking steps. I went from $176,000 in debt with zero savings or retirement to now, 2 years later, fully debt-free and over $1,000,000 net worth. I know that doesn't SOUND like a lot, but I'm incredibly proud of it. Now l'm fast-tracking my wealth building (investing $400,000 annually) and don't owe a dime to anyone. It's a good feeling.,,"
efh08sOTp-4,"Don't know about the US, but here in Switzerland polls show that many people are getting tired of the hyper-partisan trend."
efh08sOTp-4,David ur videos are the best!
efh08sOTp-4,It's not looking good for Harris in PA. In early voting data she is WAY down from 2020
efh08sOTp-4,Thank you soooo much my stomach couldn't take JD Mandell either..😂

efh08sOTp-4,"Congratulations from Australia, Mr Pakman. You have stayed calm, focussed and  fair, in an America that has gone rogue. Your country, and as a dependent of the US ours (& given we live in the world not in ring fenced enclaves, everyones), has in front of it a huge matzoh ball:  a future of hate, division and insularity led by a dementing grifter OR  prosperity, equality and clarity with your first woman president.  We are watching in the freak hemisphere, anxiously, hoping commonsense prevails."
efh08sOTp-4,She is an AI creation --- totally pre-fab and synthetic.  Her hair is not real either.
efh08sOTp-4,Maybe Trump is gay is why he was giving the microphone a blow job. Hey he's got his right your not gay bashing now are you?
efh08sOTp-4,She's appealing to felons.
efh08sOTp-4,Harris   go go go
efh08sOTp-4,Shes going to lose bad....give it up man...pointlessly  hopeless at this stage 😂😂😂😂❤😅😅😢

efh08sOTp-4,Trump is going to crush her..😊😊😅....you guys are nutty here😂😂❤
efh08sOTp-4,She is gonna lose bad ...lol..😂😂😂😂
efh08sOTp-4,Enough David. You keep re-enforcing how dumb americans are. repeating the same stupid stuff over and over again as if anyone cares. its done. stop. you've all revealed yourselves as fools. a society that let rich people pull the wool over its eyes while they fleece wealth away for themselves. americans keep letting it happen while complaining about it. give it up already. we are sick of you. you are selfishly screwing up the lives of pretty much every human. All countries should develop plans to band together and sanction the US. I am sure we can work out ways to prop our economies while we wirk to isolate the US. like isolating a pathogen so it doesnt infect the rest of us. maybe its too late.
efh08sOTp-4,Love that enthusiastic intro in Pak's voice.  We all know who's gonna win soon 💙💙

He aired a few too many grievances while performing his feats of strength with doors and microphones. 

They all went to bed when Eric & Don Jr were overheard talking about the Menendez Netflix special.

efh08sOTp-4,GO BIG BLUE 🇺🇸💙🇺🇸FOR THE WIN 🥇
efh08sOTp-4,"REMEMBER EVERYBODY. NO MATTER WHAT, GET OUT AND VOTE."
efh08sOTp-4,Vote wiseley ❤
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Do NOT vote for Trump  ... a LYING, WHINING, CRYING, INSULTING, COMPLAINING  RACIST, FASCIST, RAPIST, SEXIST,  and  BULLSH ** SPECIALIST!  He is  ""TOXIC"" to America and the World!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Exactly. Control does not equal protection. I physically gagged when I heard him say that. It was so creepy!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I don't want his kind of protection
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"SCOTUS and a GOP dominated Congress will do whatever they want, and among those things, if there are future elections, the GOP will eliminate any real opportunity for voters to express their disapproval.   If there is a bright side, it may be found in the extremely strong likelihood that the policies of right wing ideologues will literally precipitate a massive world wide depression.   What comes after that is anyone’s guess."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"BINGO! Women's votes are nothing men need to worry their pretty little heads about. They have much more important matters to deal with like seeing who can pee higher on a tree. Just keep practicing ""Don't ask, Don't tell""."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Someone mentioned this channel in comments.. came to check it out cause I like to research for myself.. LADY YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE SAYING! Your nothing more then a paid actor for demonrats! Don’t fall for this scam .. research for yourself!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,2:42 let's not forget the national abortion ban!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I almost wore that t-shirt to vote, but it was cold, so I wore my TSwift sweatshirt."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"If I may add, it's even more about punishing women,, as a fired individual named Carlson giggled to the crowd last week. Because we're very bad girls. Once we're punished, we'll be back in line where he can control us. Right?"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Americans don’t need Trump’s protection racket. Americans need their rights and liberty.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,We need to do this ladies. No one is coming to save us but ourselves. Vote blue all the way down the ticket
rfzLVZ4fncQ,That's not it. It was in fact a statement of dominance made to appeal to authoritarian men. .
rfzLVZ4fncQ,What happened to your eye belle? are you ok?
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I will gay stand up for my gay rights, especially for my gay marriage. 

I WILL NOT GO BACK!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Belle, Just wanted you to know that I am one of the GOOD “ones”! 😮 I’m voting to help the women in my life, by letting THEM help THEMSELVES. They rarely need MY help, and that’s fine by me."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"So well said. 
Not only do women have the power to say, “we do not like it” , we have the power through our votes to stop this proven to be misogynistic attitude by ensuring he’s fired once and for all. 
Women have to stand United on this one. It’s the only action bullies understand. You can’t bully us Donny boy, there are just toooo many of us. 
And that would undoubtedly be the case if men joined the just cause of respect for the women, mothers, daughters, girls and grandmothers . We have to do this."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,His words were to protect them wether they like it or not. Problem is that his kind of protection is likely a cage
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Sometimes I miss Beau. Not today. Well said.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Maybe in prison he’ll learn how uncool “whether you like it or not” really is.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I've told my daughter and my wife that nobody needs to know how you vote. Not even Me. Do You!! Don't need Dumpty to protect ANY of the women in my life..., NOT ONE!!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Pretty soon women will not have the right to vote.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Unfortunately, in the Drumpf micromind, Donny is setting up another barrage of excuses. Basically, he tells himself this is all his advisors' fault - they told him not to do something, which they ought to know is a ""blackmail"" he (the tough guy) never gives in to."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Trump says he’ll protect you, but who will protect you from Trump? Only you can, with your vote."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Love how political ads for a holes pop up in front of this . Gee do you think the people who follow this will send you 5 $?
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"The reason I don't trust Republicans.   They do not care about the opinions of everyone, and they ignore the advice of experts."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,:(
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Belle, Only you could have done this video.  Hi to Beau.  Let's win this and save democracy."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,FIERCE! Beautiful. 🤩 😍
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Trump will do whatever the numbers say will help Vlad.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,And less than 48 hours later he's threatening to execute Liz Cheney.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"The depravity of this psychopathic rapist, saying he will protect women whether they like it or not, has no bounds…."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Thank you for the update on what the clown will do
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Good one Lady Beau Belle!!!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Unfortunately, a lot of women will still vote for him. You hear them say it, show up at his rallies & make excuses for him. It makes me very sad and nervous."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Trump will protect women...  Protect them from making decisions, from doing what they want, from having autonomy.  Trump needs to be put in prison."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I love how the ad that preceded this video was TFG pleading for money and how “they”’re letting “murderers” and “terrorists” in…I let it run the whole time with the volume turned off just to waste the campaign’s money 😆🤣😆
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Come on all moms know if you have a child like that you tell them the opposite of what you want them to do!!!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Men don't protect anything except themselves and their own fragile egos. Literal research backs this up. I'm done caring about men's feelings or egos.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Josseli Barnica needlessly died after an agonizing descent into sepsis when denied an abortion in TX.  Her husband is now a widower, and their little daughter is now motherless.  All to feed the egos of trump and our TX governor/lt. governor/attorney general and to put women ""in their place"".  They have blood on their hands and lives on their souls."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Beware!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Middle-aged dude here.  I voted (all blue) to protect you ladies from Trump whether you like it or not! 😅😇
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Brilliant commentary
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Its not a right. Whether you like it or not. So why don't you do exactly what he allowed you to do. Which is put it in the states. Where it belongs. Now its very easy to win. ""You cant place bans, based on beliefs."" The exact same as you cant mandate legality based on your belief. ""My body"" is not a valid argument against people who see it as two bodies. No more than ""Its two bodies."" is a valid argument to you. This is the problem with establishment politicians. They know this. They tell you ""We are going to make it legal."" While trying to push legislation, stating its legal. Instead of just making it not illegal. Knowing its not going to work. Its stringing you along for your vote. Same as the Republicans trying to ban is stringing those people along. This absolutely should not be in the federal government. Everyone constantly wants legislation based on ""my opinion is....."" Then blame everyone else for the country being divided. Inflated egos and no self reflection. Trump put it right where it belongs. ""Like it or not.""
   I understand the fifth column. Unfortunately, many here do not. Some of those that do don't seem to realize ""by any means necessary"" also includes manipulating them as well. 
  Now go to state court with the ""You cant ban a LIBERTY, based on a belief argument. WITHOUT adding legislation stating its legal. Which can remove a doctor liberties, and get what you want.  Failure to do so means you don't actually want the problem fixed. Because it will NEVER end, until you do.    What happens outside your state, is not up to you. Its a state issue, because its not a right. Saying it is, is an invalid argument. No federal rights affect only certain groups. Its a liberty. No legislation is required to make it not illegal. Yrump did exactly what needed done to get what you want. Because you can win in state court. Much easier than you can federally."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I hope Biden,s administration becomes protective over American citizens to stop the Trump steal of the election. Fake electors even the Supreme Court needs to be stopped. Biden is still in charge of the Pentagon, the military, the FBI. I hope those handcuffs are ready to be used, while traitors expose them selves before the peaceful transfer of power gets meddled with. Arrest first then, then ask the questions later."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"The ad before this was of a woman claiming that she was going to vote for Trump because he speaks his mind, and when he says he's against an abortion ban, she believes him. First reactions: Who is this ad attracting? People lie.  Are there seriously people out there who think they've never been lied to? And he doesn't have to vote directly for it for it to happen - he said that so he could still look innocent if an abortion ban goes through. 

2nd reaction: How much did this lady get paid? Someone could offer me millions of dollars, and it still wouldn't be enough for me to sell my soul like that (and to look that naive)."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Whoever his brand manager is, give them a raise. That's almost catchphrase worthy."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Barnaka  and every other way my old brain could come up with to spell it came up empty. Would someone be so kind as to straighten me out here. Before I battle on line I like to have all my ducks in a row for a defense in depth. Thanks.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I have a feeling that a large number of Republican women will be voting for Harris whether the men like it or not.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Indeed, Belle. Ladies, vote like your life depends on it because sadly enough, it does!  What happens in the voting booth, stays in the voting booth. 💙💙💙"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,As a woman... lmao... I do not see a between the lines... this is typical and classic words and behavior of an abuser... there are many of us women that know this shit... we are not falling for that shit #NotGoingBack...  #WhetherHeLikesItOrNot
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"While too late to change for the 2024 election, one reason Democrats struggle to attract male voters is the lack of any acknowledgement of mens issues.

Hopefully from 2025 onwards mens issues are more included when advocating for gender equality. Regardless I hope Harris wins."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,As a woman I feel very threatened
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Engagement.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Yes!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Barnica
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"""The Handmaid's Tale"" should be required reading in Middle-School for every American."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,One guy said he and his wife are voting by mail so that he can watch her fill out her ballot for Trump.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"He does whatever IT takes to win, PLEASE VOTE BLUE 💙 AND SAVE DEMOCRACY 🙏"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,trupmet want to IVF all the women and force each one to carry his child
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Yes!!!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Great work. Women, let's vote!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,One thing I am certain of; it will be women's votes that will defeat trump
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I know women who are voting for Trump despite not only their own best interests, but also the best interests of their siblings, their children, and people in the community they help every day. All because the man in their life tells them to. 

I don't get it. I just don't."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Send those of us who are hated within our own family for sticking up for womens rights and voting for Kamala good vibes.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Please share this far & wide.  On your page, in your groups, share it!!! 
Women for trump signs are a thing, especially in rural areas.  Your share could give someone else the new point of view they don't know they desperately need."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Figures
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Preach Belle....Preach!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,👋✌️
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I’ve never seen anyone work as hard as Donald Trump to lose an election.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I wonder how many women advisers work on Trump's campaign?
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Thank you. Great video
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"It’s the plan of The Heritage Foundation.
Trump is their face.
Fuck all that"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"As a man, I see the great importance of a woman with a backbone"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"The ivory that his female cultists lost their shiz over what Mark Cuban said, but ignore everything Trump, Vance and the rest say"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Trump is a stepping stone to the handmaids tale being a reality
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"He's campaigning really hard for the incel vote, isn't he?"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"It’s all part of the Christofascist agenda, and after losing RoevWade which they said they wouldn’t do, how much more evidence do you need? The choice is obvious because if Trump wins women won’t get another chance to make a choice. Voted blue in Oregon and withheld my vote if that was not an option. Not playing."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Wild that we're getting to the point where it's largely ""men vote republican,  women vote democrat""."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Belle is spot on AGAIN!!!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,it's pretty clear a lot of MAGA likes the idea of controlling women too
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"We have a secret ballot for a reason, so everyone can vote their how they want without fear of reprisal.   If you are in a relationship with a MAGA vote democrat and let the MAGA person think what they want to think about your vote."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,He thinks we are dumb and stupid. Even Haley he called bird brain
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"As a man from beyond the borders of the USA, the fact that the republicans are trying to push back the clock on so many issues seems to be a symptom of pathological insecurity on their part. America led the way in bringing many countries out of the darkness of gender inequality, though some beat them to it, but much of what they do, though framed in terms of religion and ""morality"", looks like petulance and resentment towards those who rested a little power from their grandfathers. Like any good mother, or cat lady would do, maybe it's time to put them on the naughty spot for a while (say at least four years) to consider what they did wrong."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I do want to push back against the idea that “men” are under Trump’s sway.  “Men” suggests these cretins possess a whole host of positive qualities that anyone supporting Tump just does not possess.  No one who qualifies for the term “man” would support Trump.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Great video. ❤
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Give the gop power and you will see white only buses, bars and restaurants come back in USA."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,One of your best@
rfzLVZ4fncQ,🙅🏾🔙🗳️💙
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Some women--i heard--like Don-Old because they believe his lies ABOUT saving them $ with cheap gas & food & lowered taxes
rfzLVZ4fncQ,And the women who need the most protection can come live with him at Mar-a-Lago i guess?
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Let’s not forget about taking away our vote!  Yes, they’ve said that too.  We shouldn’t worry our pretty little heads about who to vote for, they want to repeal it.  Think they won’t try?  That’s exactly what they said about Roe.  🤬🤬🤬. Vote blue or you may never vote again!  💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,The thumbnail for this is priceless.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"If you're a forcedbirther, you are NOT a protector of women.
If you're a forcedbirther, women needs protection from YOU.
If you're a forcedbirther, you are not against the deep state, you ARE the deep state.
If you're a forcedbirther, and a father to a daughter, you are failing and endangering your daughter."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I think Trump is saying that women would feel more safe under a big scary monster who rules by whim and with brutality so that nobody dares do anything. Very much like in North Korea. He admires dictators. And he would use his red-hatted thugs to enforce his whims outside of the law. He has no respect for the rule of law, as he has shown us. He doesn’t like power being in the hands of principles like the Constitution. He wants power to all be in his hands so he can rule like a god. This is why he must be defeated. No one would be safe under this system. We don’t realize how much we are protected by the rule of law. His personality is what is so dangerous here because he is psychologically set up to NEED TO BE dictatorial, to have total loyalty, to be obeyed and unquestioned and worshipped. He’s been telling us for nine years now what kind of leaders he admirers and that is people who rule with an iron fist. NOBODY would be safe with such a chaotic, whimsical, worship-based system. Least of all women. This is the kind of fascist theocratic oligarchy evangelicals have been orchestrating for over 40 years and they would put a man of such low moral character as Trump at the head of it. It’s a recipe for disaster. He must be defeated."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Oh I get it now.  They looked down on so-called 3rd world countries and the Taliban because they were jealous.  They want the same situation in the US.  The us, a s-hole country where women are chattel and the very, very few have enormous wealth through the exploitation of its citizens."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I never trusted him. Even through the television, he gave me the creeps before he did Atlantic City dirty."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I am seeing a line from people who want to show the dems how mad they are that they have not stoped the Geniside happening in Gaza. They are saying I am punishing the Demicats. Womans rights in this county don't mater if we don't fight for human rights in all countries. While I love the passion. How do they think they will be fighting for human rights in other countries when they have none in this one.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Thanks Belle.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,💙💙💙💙💙💙💥
rfzLVZ4fncQ,The vote.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,If Kamala don't win big. I'm going to be like. Wow.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"There are more women in this country than men. It should be a piece of cake to vote in another woman -- a former prosecutor and state attorney general -- in lieu of a foul mouthed, foul minded parasitic felon. Tell me I'm wrong."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,MAGA is FREAKING out about Kamala's response to this Trump comment. She is strong and Presidential. Reality has gob smacked them upside the head because they HATE reality. They live in a bubble and when they can't make sense of that bubble they FREAK out.  I waded through a couple thousand comments about this over at CNN.  They don't understand that I find Don to be offensive and creepy. Because of who HE is and WHAT he says.  Not because of what Harris says.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I don’t need, nor do I want, the type of protection Trump is offering!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Trumprette's is real, no ands, ifs, or buts."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I'm not voting for myself this election.
I'm voting for my daughter.  Nobody, but nobody gets to take away her rights, and as her father. I will always have her back 💯 
I also have two granddaughters.
I will vote for Harris,
My first time voting was Reagan 
I like my guns, and I am pro life,  but my version of pro life is from the cradle to the grave, not just until the kid is born. I'm also pro keeping my nose out of other peoples business. I'm also a Christian and I believe kids should be taught about christ but not in public schools, if you want your kids to know christ get your lazy asses out of bed and take them to church on Sunday.
And if your preacher is talking about intolerance get a new preacher"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Best one yet Belle.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Never forget there are a lot of pseudo Christian nationalists who will work to enact everything Belle warns about.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Hey Mr Trump & MAGA men

I'm a woman, a biological woman, aka cisfemale. In body only, but that's a separate issue, and I don't think it needs to be dealt with here.

BACK OFF NOW. Get your tiny primary brain OUT OF MY BUSINESS. It's my life - Jon Bon Jovi. You do most emphatically NOT have ANY right, God given or otherwise, to control me, my body, or my life. Just like I have no right to control yours. That's as it should be.

Ladies - time to stop being a bloody doormat. Otherwise you make a mockery from those early pioneers who went out to fight for your rights to vote, work, get out of a toxic relationship alive & relatively intact. They fought for you, don't let them down."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Absolutely, I agree!  Thank you!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"0:52 Belle is referring to the tragic and preventable death of Josseli Barnica in 2021. At 17 weeks in, she began to have a miscarriage and was rushed to the hospital. But since doctors could detect a heartbeat, they worried they could be sued and imprisoned if they assisted her body in the process (as is the law in Texas). They offered her no aide for 40 hours while her miscarriage progressed slowly. Over that time she developed the massive infection that killed her. More than a dozen medical experts who reviewed her medical records said her death was preventable."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"*I VOTED!!* 
And, yes: _I cried._
We aren't weak, ladies; never have been 💪🏼💪🏾💪.

✌🏼💙💫 from 🍑, 🇺🇸, 🌎"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Real men will devote their lives to protect women. That’s why you’re losing people and need to shank and with neo cons. Men and women that live in reality understand his point on a human level, not the robotic level you do… you tell women to be deceitful to men, while Trump telling men to protect women…but that’s how you work, example you said “when Trump says he wants to protect women, he really means he want to control women”. Very very low. I hope women and girls don’t look to you as a role model 😂"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Any man who doesn't stand against Trump is no man at all.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Honestly i think men like trump deserve to be ruled over by women. Clearly his mother didn’t do a good enough job instilling empathy into him.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"""Whether the women like it or not,"" says the self-professed sexual predator and adjudicated rapist."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"In the 2016  election the OLD donOLD's  rhetoric and personality drew all the WHITE NATIONALISTS back onto the grid from their backwoods camps , to vote for HIM !

This time he is drawing all the misogynist back into the spotlight ,to vote for HIM !

FORTUNATELY THEY ARE MOSTLY THE SAME GROUP OF LOSERS !"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I would never wish death on someone,  but is it still wrong to wish he has a stroke before the election? God help us if he wins....er,  I mean, if his cheating wins!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Vote for Kamala and Tim, whether they like it or not 😂💙"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"The most fervent trump supporter I know is a woman.  So this characterization that it is men who will foist him on to women just doesn’t fly in my experience.  Almost every man I know is voting for Harris.  Several women are voting for trump.  This may not match the rest of the world, but it is my reality."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"https://youtu.be/0GHKK27JWr4?si=ycLOSf3SsN0BwACm

A great example of good reporting."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I posted this on another channel, but it's worth repeating:
In (red) Kansas, when voters recently upheld women's right to abortion, the polls before the election showed 47% AGAINST women's right to abortion and 43% FOR women's rights, with 10% UNDECIDED.  The results of the election were: 59% FOR women's rights, and 41% AGAINST.  I am surely hoping for similar results this election."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,🤞 the vote route works. The way Beau left ripped open some old trauma scars. I’m ready for maga to start crossing worse lines.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Protecting women from having to make a decision on their own.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,ETTD
rfzLVZ4fncQ,WE Women WILL take this digusting exhibit of Manhood DOWN ROEvember 5th
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Remember your mother ❤
rfzLVZ4fncQ,And the men should stand behind women!   VOTE BLUE GUY'S 💙
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Apparently women Need to be Protected FROM him not BY him
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I’m a dude and yall got my vote
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"""The British Bulldog's gonna win, whether he wants to, or not!"" See, it works in wrestling,  but not in real life."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,This woman thinks the main think women need protection from is Trump and his supporters.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,💯🇺🇲💙🗳💙🇺🇲💯
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Whether we like it or not seems to be his entire life history's treatment of women.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Thank you Belle 💙
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I felt my blood chill on that opening smile.... and I've been single for 10 years now.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,women protect women and rescue women.   from MEN.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,My tiny little lady brain got two master' degrees and a phd!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Those women standing behind him when he said that should be proud of themselves
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Whew, could feel the justified anger here. I had this conversation with my gf earlier, about her aunt stating that she “felt like trump really cared about women”. I’m sorry, what? WHAT?! We were both sick about it."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Why is this race even remotely close? Wake up Republicans,  don't give MAGA more than 20 % of the vote,  cleanse your party of this nonsense"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Please help  VP Kamala Harris SMASH that glass ceiling!!!!
Vote blue all the way !!!! 💙🗳💙🗳🇺🇸"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Home run. Best you've done so far. Bravo.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Trump was literally advertising 14.88 pillows during his Rocky Mount NC rally.....
14.88= nazi code"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Our votes will tell him, once and for all, “No means NO, Jack Cass!!”"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,No one knows more than him. Just ask him.  But lock him up first!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,There's no way he can win
rfzLVZ4fncQ,You go girl!!!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Belle, you are so right!  I hope people, especially women, realize that and vote for Harris."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Protect? No. I’d rather that Not happen. His protection can/will get us killed.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Thank you, Belle.  You’re absolutely correct. He’s not done. He’s just getting started, but it’s up to us to ensure that this doesn’t continue. 💙🇺🇸💙"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Trump would be a good Lord Protector for America. Like Cromwell was, for Ireland."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,""" When fascism comes to america, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross. ""

There's only one way to stop Fascists. ONE; and it sure as shit isn't voting."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Voted in Texas today, straight blue all the way down. I care about the women and girls in my life. Do you?"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Bit unmanly to let a guy you've never met make decisions for the women in your life, isn't it?  The women in your life losing their ability to choose isn't exactly chivalrous, is it?"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I have followed Beau and enjoyed his content for long time. However, Belle is made for moment."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Late 90's shock jock, must mean 1890's. I can't wait until the only thing I hear about Trump is when he reports to Rykers Island. Ladies, show him that he's the one who needs protection, not you."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Those males that fell under Trumps spell aren't men; they a little boys in fat bodies.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Who could pretend for a moment that he would choose to, or be capable of, protecting us?
He was Epstein's buddy.
That is what he thinks of children.
He took E. Jean Carroll against her will.
That is what he thinks of females.
He never paid a full invoice and left many, many completely unpaid.
That is what he thinks small business men & women.
He lied to every bank, tax collector and insurance company.
That is where his integrity fails.

He has sold us out to the ideologies our parents and grand parents laid down their lives and futures to protect us from. 
MAGA is the consumption of the conservative perspective by a billionaire con-man and his puppet masters. It is hollowed out now to be fear and anger and hate. No other policies exist.
A reality-TV fictitious persona: The Failure that is Trump Brings America to the Brink.

Harris and Walz will win.
Trump/ MAGA will implode 
and surely we will all suffer. 
In the moments before that, I hope we can all remember what we have in common. 

This is going to be brutal but we are not going back."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"I care about this exactly as much as women care that men don't have any automatic Rights to their children like women do.  That is to say: Precisely zero.  I'm too worried about mass Male Genital Mutilation, Mass Male Suicide, the RIFE false accusations in this CUNTry, divorce rape and baby trapping to care about any of this.  This is the exact same logic women use to dismiss my struggles as a male.  So it's strong and empowered and moral and ethical...right?  RIGHT, HYPOCRITES!!?!?"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"There’s a certain type of guy who, the best thing they can do to protect women, is to stay as far away from them as possible."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Nothing in Trump's history suggests he cares about women at all. End of sentence.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"My little 70 year old lady brain hopes that so many women and women supporters vote Trump out, that the pain of rejection, feels like a castration to him. Overturning Roe was a gut punch I will never get over. My three daughters and three granddaughters deserve the same rights I have enjoyed in my lifetime. Vote Blue! I already have❤"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Most everyone knows more than trump!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"""Whether they like it or not""- gave me actual disgusted chills when the rapist says that"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Sounds like women need someone to defend them from that protector.😠😠
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"He's going to have the supreme court declare him the winner no matter what the votes say, isn't he?"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Of course the entitled serial rapist feels like he can do whatever he wants to women. Vote blue so he can be held accountable.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,How can any woman support this con artist.....he endangers wife's... daughters... granddaughters.... nieces...aunts....WTF....are these women thinking about.....he can do what he wants and women can like it or not...is he talking about grasping women by the pussy again....or more of the women rights...... yeah..... women voting rights will be next whether you like it or not
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Spoken like a true misogynist.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Trump ONLY cares about himself.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"The thumbnail, combined with the title, was pitch PERFECT 😱"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Or he'll do it whether the men like it or not too! Wake-up and Vote Blue so this lunatic has no chance of being President!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Excellent video. Thank you..
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Project 2025 also includes article 19 womens right to vote! There is so much we don't know or hear about from Trump. How can some blindly vote for someone who wants to be an oppressive, mentally unwell dictator ! Wtf people! 
Harris/Walz 2024💙🇺🇸 down the ballot.💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Convicted Felon trump sounds like a delusional narcissist. 

Vote 🗳 BLUE for America. For Women."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,You rock Belle
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Next they'll make it illegal for a woman to cross state lines without a man's permission & a scan of her uterus----- cuz they want to protect her, whether she likes it or not."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,how much crap does he have to pile up till  maga realizes the truth.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,The sad thing is that women will still vote for him.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Like it or not? He's a freaking RAPIST.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Great advice!  I hope women are listening.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I wonder how safe the female poll workers felt when the teen Trump supporter and his Trump supporter cohorts badgered and threatened them with a machete in Florida today.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Classic abuser lingo. Thanks but certainly no, thanks!"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Just when you think he can’t get any dumber. 🤬🤬🤬
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Protector ie predator.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Voted blue💙💙💙
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"...and a whole list of other things. LIKE OUR VOTE. Yeah, they're already talking about trying to take our vote away. Let that thought simmer... but not for long."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Sorry but as dudes, we've had a lot of time trying to lead and do the right things...bravo. but more often than not in my life, it's been the strong, capable women who have had to step in the breach and fix shit. Sorry ladies, we still have great potential...lead on"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"The saddest part is watching women being the worst about it in support for Trump, they're lost in the sauce.
Military wives who don't understand that their husbands swear an oath to the US Constitution and NOT the President, this I see as the worst cases."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Oopsies, does that mean Jenny Thomas and corrupt Supreme Court Thomas could be denied their interracial marriage?"
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Would literally rather be protected by a sock.
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Billionaire ❓️ The only thing he has a billion of is lies❗️
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"If we get rid of Trump, it will be largely thanks to women."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,I will protect you whether you like it or not. I can't think of the larger RED FLAG!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"""Protect you whether you like it or not"" sounds like restraining order justification."
rfzLVZ4fncQ,Thank you Belle!
rfzLVZ4fncQ,This video just kicked Charlie Kirk in those garbanzos he calls balls
rfzLVZ4fncQ,"Trump is a  control freak to others, but can't control himself."
819ys0_G3Qs,"Harris gave Brett a true I'm not stuck in here with you, you're stuck in here with me moment. 😂"
819ys0_G3Qs,Who is this lady? Is she Beau's wife?
819ys0_G3Qs,The difference was that Trump doesn't answer questions- EVER!
819ys0_G3Qs,Yay Belle!!!
819ys0_G3Qs,you have to be an idiot to vote for harris....  do you not like the USA ??
819ys0_G3Qs,I voted for 4 more years of increasing deficits and record national debt!
819ys0_G3Qs,"Kamala's policies are harsh. Plus, one policy she has stolen from Trump is the no-tax on tips."
819ys0_G3Qs,What happened to Beau??? I hope he's okay!
819ys0_G3Qs,👋🏾 Are you Beau’s wife? Is he ok? Nice to see your face😌
819ys0_G3Qs,Oh yeah ! She lit them up again !
819ys0_G3Qs,Sorry for the stupid question......what happened to Beau? Is he ok? I am not a regular viewer so I probably missed details.
819ys0_G3Qs,I love your Bob Ross shirt
819ys0_G3Qs,The excuses I hear people using to justify voting for Trump is really sad.  And from women no less.
819ys0_G3Qs,Nothing she or any Democrat ever does will be good enough for MAGA.  Vote 💙 and vote early.
819ys0_G3Qs,"I just saw a clip of Donny the dime store dictator, threatening to get rid of 60 minutes and CBS, because of that interview. 😂😂😂 Ohhh poor Donny.😩😫😤😭"
819ys0_G3Qs,TRUMP 2024 🇺🇸💯👍 JUST SAY NO TO KAMELTOE
819ys0_G3Qs,Thanks Belle.
819ys0_G3Qs,Great video. Vote blue. 💙💙
819ys0_G3Qs,Hey!
819ys0_G3Qs,"The difference between Beau talking to us, and Belle reading to us is stark. I'm going to step away from watching these for a few months and see if they improve. I won't stop subscribing, though. This channel is still an important voice."
819ys0_G3Qs,"FAUX ""NEWS"""
819ys0_G3Qs,I think you’re a nice fill in in Beaus absence. Keep up the great work
819ys0_G3Qs,"Talk about fact checking, Kamala did a great job calling Bret out!"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Not sure if people saw, but Laura Ingram was jabbing at Harris that Joy and Hope was not a campaign strategy. After the Baier interview she then has a graphic of smiling and waving Harris with the caption 'Attack of the 5'4"" woman'. I was laughing the rest of the day. The supposedly strong right is afraid of her now! Still busts me up."
819ys0_G3Qs,"‘…sorry, here’s another lame excuse badly attempting to explain the insanity that is trump….just let your brain go numb  and sit back and take it. K’
-G🤪p"
819ys0_G3Qs,I think they had every intention to “debate” Harris and bait her because they know Trump needs help and can’t do it himself.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Is not a surprised she handled herself so well under a confrontational interview, she's was a prosecutor after all"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Kamala Harris graduated from Hastings College of Law.  This law school ranks 82nd out of 196 law schools.  She took her bar exam and failed.  She never owned a business and never had her own employees.  From 2017-2021, she was a California senator who worked on 164 pieces of legislation.   Not one of them ever became the law.  Her job approval in California was 8%.   As vice president, she had the lowest approval rating of any VP in US history at 28%.  She also had 13 congressional aids quit due to harassment during that time.   When she ran for president in 2020 she got less than 10% electoral support and was forced to drop out of the race very early.   Biden admitted she was a DEI pick.    Thank you to Bret Baier - the ONLY journalist to expose her for the absolute fraud she is!!  ALL journalists are supposed to vet every candidate the way Bret Baier did in asking real questions demanding truthful answer"
819ys0_G3Qs,Love from a Xanderhal and Vaush fan!
819ys0_G3Qs,Who the hell is this? I never subscribed to this channel and all of sudden I’m getting notifications????? 😂😂😂
819ys0_G3Qs,"There are very few real journalists working on Faux news, no credibility 🤢"
819ys0_G3Qs,FOX.. OMGOODNESS FOX is the mark of the beast for those that dont know.... Murdock worships the devil himself netanyahu
819ys0_G3Qs,Yeah she got her viral moment  because bret baier messed up. Anyway where's Beau? Haven't heard from him for a while now
819ys0_G3Qs,💙💙💙
819ys0_G3Qs,What happened to Beau?
819ys0_G3Qs,Smart move on Harris to do the interview.  The only way you are gonna change peoples vote at this time in the game is to “go behind enemy lines” or “reach across the isle”
819ys0_G3Qs,"Fox ""News"". Fair and balanced.  BULLSHIT.  How is it EVERYONE else but the MAGATARDS can see Fox ""News"" is LIES AND BULLSHIT???"
819ys0_G3Qs,Thank you Belle! I expected nothing less from the woman who once made the rapist Brett Kavanaugh cry
819ys0_G3Qs,love your accent!!
819ys0_G3Qs,Harris is better under pressure than Trump.  Then again that is a pretty low bar.
819ys0_G3Qs,Holocaust Harris is the Fascist dictator you fear in Trump! Vote 3rd Party
819ys0_G3Qs,"Kamala Harris with strength and intelligence took Baier and the entire Fox so called News Network to the wood shed for their pathetic stunt. Baier's journalistic credential's continue to go downhill, and we are all so proud of our next President Kamala Harris for forcefully standing up and never backing down for truth and honest and factual information for America. Brett Baier, and Fox News, your network of disinformation was held to the FIRE by Kamala, and you were put on guard to never underestimate, this incredible leader again. Vote blue 💙💙💙💙💙💙 up and down the ballot.😊😊"
819ys0_G3Qs,Harris walked into the lion’s den. The lion tried to bite her. Then the lion apologized.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Just watched that interview. It was uncomfortable watching Brett try to plow over and through every answer she tried to give. But what is especially disappointing is how much better she handled herself than trump or Biden ever could have, and yet there are still people claiming she’s unintelligent and can’t finish a coherent sentence. Women have to do so much better to even be considered competent - it’s just exhausting."
819ys0_G3Qs,Bret  lied as a good Republican.  Pinocchio wouldn’t have done Better.
819ys0_G3Qs,"SHE went there to show their idiot viewers that what that !@#$ of a ""news"" organization says is a lie.  THEY, being the ones going for a ""GOTCHA!"", proved that on their own. But, it doesn't matter. Those same idiot viewers are never going to change their minds. Their orange god is their god."
819ys0_G3Qs,Kamala was loaded for bear in her Fox interview!
819ys0_G3Qs,4 tha algorithm. Please vote those fascists out!
819ys0_G3Qs,Thanks Belle !!!
819ys0_G3Qs,I guess Bret Baier found out up close and personal why the felon has chosen the spineless route not to debate Harris a second time.  Now we see why he's whining about wanting Biden back as his opponent.
819ys0_G3Qs,"It's so gratifying to see Fox etc try to control the narrative using their usual bag of dirty tricks, and still failing."
819ys0_G3Qs,Harris came prepared. She seems to always do that.  I think it’s because she really cares about us and always has.  Thanks Belle.  I am loving your sage messaging during these important times.
819ys0_G3Qs,"And where is the Trump-man?
He's at home, washing his tights!"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Tr*mpsters willfully ignore the truth. None of this commentary matters to them, they're addicted to their führer."
819ys0_G3Qs,"Blame on the IT video guy! Bret knew exactly what he did n failed. It was an interview, yet he talked over her!  An Asian black woman has to show detail  plans, interviews, rallies n FoxHO while criminal  trump wants to use the military on American ppl that not licking his fat azz! Yeah AMERICA wtf is wrong w/you?"
819ys0_G3Qs,This channel has stopped being rhe opinions of a concerned citizen and started being scripted statements read on camera.
819ys0_G3Qs,"I miss how Beau would look around the room as he was saying things, rather than stay locked on a script.  His eyes would shift their gaze constantly.  Sometimes down and thoughtful.  Sometimes up and exasperated.  I really want that authenticity to return to this channel."
819ys0_G3Qs,"So Brett was being his normal 
stupid and lazy self like the rest
of Fox News. Foxsplaining?"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Oh, she more than held her own. She pinned Brett  Baier’s ears back. It was a pleasure to watch. Also, Fox not playing it straight. Imagine that! 🤥🤥🤥🤥"
819ys0_G3Qs,"tRump is a whiney, evil, spoiled little brat.  tRump and the MAGAts must be stopped!!!  VOTE BLUE AMERICA!!!  From the top of the ticket, all the way down to dog catcher, VOTE BLUE!  💙💙💙"
819ys0_G3Qs,Kamala brought a mirror to the FOX interview
819ys0_G3Qs,She ate him up. Just like she did with tRump during the debate. She’s smarter than all of maga put together. 🦋🧢🦕🅿️
819ys0_G3Qs,This is what prosecutors do…. I thought the right 🥰 loved prosecutors.
819ys0_G3Qs,Kamala Harris is so much more competent than the felon in chief! 😂
819ys0_G3Qs,She sure did handle the situation. That’s why I’m voting for her.
819ys0_G3Qs,"I call shenanigans. Baier absolutely wanted the clip that was played, it was NOT a mistake. It was typical Fox deception."
819ys0_G3Qs,Thank you for the commentary.
819ys0_G3Qs,"How can the polls be so close?? The more Trump declines, lies, tells us who he is, why aren’t the numbers tanking on him?"
819ys0_G3Qs,#stopProject2025
819ys0_G3Qs,The t-shirt is perfect!
819ys0_G3Qs,She should go back and wipe the floor with another one of Fox’s mouth-pieces.😂🎉
819ys0_G3Qs,I find it extremely hard to believe that a Fox host would lie. They're the epitome of truth and decency....
819ys0_G3Qs,"Interrupt, interrupt, interrupt and then ask questions conceived to put VP Harris on the defensive and say something she might regret. It wasn't an interview; It was an attack and she handled it like tough professional she is. Fox has nothing to do with ""news""; It is merely the propaganda organ of the Republican party."
819ys0_G3Qs,An iron fist in a velvet glove.
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox needs to be unplugged from US military bases. Taxpayers shouldn’t be funding their trash.
819ys0_G3Qs,Yep who can take the heat. Kamala is good in the kitchen and in the spot light. 🌊🇺🇸
819ys0_G3Qs,She handled him! Bret was disrespectful and rude. Vote blue💙💙💙 down the line!
819ys0_G3Qs,"I’m so tried for the crap from Fox News over editing all news about trump , Kamala and Biden  … Harris kicked butt …"
819ys0_G3Qs,This is probably gonna be the only time I complain about anything on this channel but after hearing about the legal battles and Bob Ross's family being cut out of any profits from his likeness I'd never give that company a dime.
819ys0_G3Qs,"If you have to say that you expected a sound bite of the spin instead of a sound bite of your candidate, you’ve not only failed but shown how your candidate has failed. I don’t think any of us was naive enough to expect actual journalism from Fox, but we expected a pretense of it that was absent here."
819ys0_G3Qs,"💯 GET HER JADE. “Whoops??” Sure Fox News, sure… 😒😒😒"
819ys0_G3Qs,Thanks Belle.
819ys0_G3Qs,"He talked over her, he would not have done that to Trump or any other man.  She called him out.  Way to go for her.  Why does this misogamy not get called out in the main stream press, oh maybe because they are doing it too."
819ys0_G3Qs,"I can't believe anyone thinks he should have been harder on Harris. It's really hard to gotcha a truth teller when you are steeped in peddling gaslighting. The harder a gaslighter goes after the truth teller, the dumber he looks."
819ys0_G3Qs,MASA - MAKE AMERICA - SANE - AGAIN - Vote Harris and Walz! 💙💙💙💙💙👍👍👍👍👍
819ys0_G3Qs,"Belle - you have a good day too... 😊

As much as you rock, I also miss Beau.

Might he be coming back for a cameo or a once-in-a-while appearance?

Or you could do a duet. 🤣

Regardless, I'll be happy to listen to you until the end of time; but I am also very fond of Beau...

Thank you to you and your team for all you do! 🥰"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Fox dug its own hole. It could have interviewed Harris normally. Ask her tough questions and let her answer fully. But because it wanted to trap Harris and embarrass her, it ended up backfiring."
819ys0_G3Qs,It is high time to reinstitute AND revamp the Fairness Doctrine for the digital age. Shut down the propaganda networks and shut up the propagandists.
819ys0_G3Qs,"For MAGA RINO Cult when it comes to the Democrats, they would rather ""See"" Litteral Cat -O- Nine Tails with barbs, rather than 'Hear' and consider anything else.
Either your extreme or, your the enemy within."
819ys0_G3Qs,"Wasn't this the same interview where Trump identified himself with January 6 insurrectionists by saying ""we"" and ""us""?"
819ys0_G3Qs,She needs to be asked and answer the question if elected president and have the opportunity to pardon trump would you?
819ys0_G3Qs,Irony is hypocrisy if the person knows the truth yet denies it or pretends not to.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Who the fuck thinks fox deserves any respect. Like ""all due respect"" to fox is somewhere between a burning bag of shit on their porch to a trip to the wall."
819ys0_G3Qs,All I can say is “Go KH”
819ys0_G3Qs,"Beady-Eyed Bret is, just like everyone else on that ""news"" ""network"".... *is lying through his teeth.*"
819ys0_G3Qs,When Faux News breaks under pressure.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Harris is smart, tough, and competent.  She strides confidently into hostile interviews, and into that now-famous debate with Trump, and knocks it out of the park.
She's got my vote, for sure."
819ys0_G3Qs,"Belle, you are absolutely killing it. I am still a follower and a fan."
819ys0_G3Qs,This channel has not come up on my feed for a while. You look a bit different :P
819ys0_G3Qs,Don’t expect Fox to stop lying now…especially this close to the election!🤥. Voting Blu in a red state 🗳️💯🥶
819ys0_G3Qs,Baier Rabbit fell short… lol
819ys0_G3Qs,"I also don't buy it because he was showing the clip as proof that Trump doesn't say ""Enemies Within."" He acted like it was a zinger that would end any talk about Trump saying Enemies Within and using the military on those who disagree with him."
819ys0_G3Qs,I have seen other Leftists try to claim Harris is making misstep after misstep. I am certain that a lot of Leftists want to convince their base that Harris is failing because it would vindicate their critiques of the Democrats. I think we can have both a sober acceptance that the Democrats are doing fine and also still push back against their immoral positioning on Palestine and the border.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Said it before and I’ll say it again… faux news, the facilitator within. Can’t wait for the garbage they say during the election and get sued again."
819ys0_G3Qs,No worries. The MAGAsphere has already convinced themselves that she bombed
819ys0_G3Qs,I mailed my ballot today!  Blue all the way!
819ys0_G3Qs,Thank you Belle
819ys0_G3Qs,"It wasn't an explanation. It was an excuse and a lie. Brett is joining the ""Shame Yourself for Donald"" club."
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox should lose it's broadcast licence it's not a news network that's clearly fraudulent to claim it is.
819ys0_G3Qs,"He said, ""trump was interviewed this morning - he addressed this...."" then played the clip.  Not buying the wrong clip BS."
819ys0_G3Qs,"Thank you, Belle. You are fire! More please."
819ys0_G3Qs,"I truly hope at least a few Fox captives were able to catch that, and it made them think.  Meidas Touch does a regular video just reading comments on their videos from former trump voters about what broke the camel's back for them and why they're voting for Harris now. It's so cathartic because most of the time, I'm disheartened about the volume of people who still support him after everything that's gone on, especially the last 5 years."
819ys0_G3Qs,"Honestly, the morally deficient who support Trump will not be swayed by anything Harris or any reasonable person."
819ys0_G3Qs,"That claim that she sought a ""viral moment"" confirms for me that that was exactly what Fox was fishing for. They wanted to bait her into being emotional, and she refused to take it. She's smarter than they are."
819ys0_G3Qs,Thanks Belle. ❤
819ys0_G3Qs,"I did love how difficult it was for baier to say that he made a mistake, it looked like he almost choked on the words. LOL!"
819ys0_G3Qs,"She refused to Answer Questions, And We don't even believe she can Count because when Bret asked Her How many Illegal Immigrants She allowed into the Country She couldn't even say the Number ........or.....was it that She Wouldn't?.....HMMMMMM. Then it was the ole' Filibuster......She went into Her spew to EAT UP TIME (She even got there late). What a Piece of work. She really showed Her true colors that night. She didn't even show up at the Gala event for Roasting Her behind (I guess she can't take a joke). Perhaps you should wear your little Lefty Hat to Her Office and See if she needs another Flunky to fire. Lol.  Meanwhile.......

        VOTE TRUMP!
         👀🐘🇺🇸🍍♥️"
819ys0_G3Qs,"In all seriousness, those that are voting for Harris please tell me why. I’m leaning toward Trump. Change my mind."
819ys0_G3Qs,Harris is a failure. Stop with the lies.
819ys0_G3Qs,🤞🌎✌️
819ys0_G3Qs,"Fox? Deceptive editing?? NO WAY!! 

(Yes, that's sarcasm.)"
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox people are stupid and keep forgetting that the internet exists
819ys0_G3Qs,What's the deal with some acitvist group suing CBS with misleading or misrepresenting Harris's ability to communicate?  They want the full interview because they think there's something there?
819ys0_G3Qs,"Voting for Harris with joy and pride on Monday. We need a genuine leader, not a thin-skinned, spiraling narcissist."
819ys0_G3Qs,"Can anybody clear up the details on how the interview ended? I haven't gotten around to watching it yet, but some reading online seems to show a lot of fingerpointing going on. the left are saying fox cut the interview short and the right are saying that it was harris' aides who forced fox to stop. both sides of course saying because it was going poorly for the other side"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Thanks, Bell."
819ys0_G3Qs,Thanks for the info Mrs Beau 😊
819ys0_G3Qs,👍👍
819ys0_G3Qs,Engagement.
819ys0_G3Qs,He is completely Disingenuous....or just foxy......SAME THING.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Nice shirt,18,17 16,oh already voted,now let's put that pretty big absolutely beautiful tree right there.No Mistakes,or accidents. 
Have a Great Voting Experience!"
819ys0_G3Qs,Where's Beau?
819ys0_G3Qs,She came to speak truth and delivered the ass kicking requested of her.
819ys0_G3Qs,Perfect work Belle! Hi to Beau!
819ys0_G3Qs,Bair is a total lier maga puppet
819ys0_G3Qs,I noticed republicans aren’t talking about the fox interview. That is because Harris clearly dominated and made fox her b!tch.
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox is shit.  Foreign owned shit.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Did everyone see the Trump Fox sit down.  They treated him like a nursing home resident.  They also used a poopy towel to sit on.  If Trump gets elected, expect Vance to be President before 2028."
819ys0_G3Qs,Who cares what Bret thinks about her and her motivation? I certainly don't. He is a nothing burger
819ys0_G3Qs,"'Lion's Den' or Moron Lounge? 700,000,000+ reasons why Fox is not news nor a lion anything.  Unless you meant lyin'."
819ys0_G3Qs,Headline News:Faux host/ interviewer becomes political operative.Who'd a thought?
819ys0_G3Qs,Thanks!
819ys0_G3Qs,"I've said it before, very little of American politics is trying to change anyone's mind, it is instead about trying to get people out to vote in the first place.  Who they intend to vote for was decided long ago, few minds will be changed by any of this.  So instead both sides just want to motivate their supporters to vote - and in the case of the Republicans, try to prevent people from voting.

The Harris interview on Fox may have been Harris trying to get a viral moment, or speak to the other side if only for a moment, but I think mostly it was about her showing ""I can walk into hostile territory and handle myself quite well, thank you very much.""  Which as said, Trump could never do even on his best day.  This was about showing her supporters that she is tough, can handle hostility without crying like a baby, and retain her composure no matter what (to be fair, years in a courtroom likely taught her most of that).  This was to show her supporters that they *should* support her, and they should get out and vote for her, support that it was clear Biden did not have."
819ys0_G3Qs,Faux snooze. Tough bananas you used to wases.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Bret Baier is just another MAGAhat - lying is the main language technique they use because the ""dear leader"" does it all the time."
819ys0_G3Qs,Does anyone know what is causing Trump’s recent surge in the polls? It’s making me anxious
819ys0_G3Qs,"What has me seething at the moment is the defeatism out of ""Washington Week with the Atlantic"" on PBS right now.  A substitute host and one panelist were playing ""horse race"" and proclaiming that a nearly tied electorate means that Trump will win in just over two weeks.  It's just the type of junk journalism that Beau and Bell would condemn!"
819ys0_G3Qs,"What!

A politician went on a news show for an interview to *checks notes* affect how the people view them?

What a fucking intelligent and deep observation from a *checks notes* political ""journalist"""
819ys0_G3Qs,"The woman was the District Attorney for San Francisco and the Attorney General for the State of Calif. Now, she's the Vice President of the U.S.  This is not her first rodeo."
819ys0_G3Qs,Thank you Belle and Team.
819ys0_G3Qs,"She had 787 million reasons not to go on Fox, but she still did. Early voting starts on two days and I can’t wait to vote."
819ys0_G3Qs,Maybe she needs a friendly interview.  Perhaps a lengthy sit-down with her new bff Dick Cheney?  Maybe she will nominate his as secretary of state if she wins.  😂😂
819ys0_G3Qs,"Of course, she held her own, she is a competent woman, something that scares republicans beyond reason."
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox News? Irrelevant.
819ys0_G3Qs,"The usual absurdly hypocritical projection:

Harris participated in the interview because SHE was seeking a ""viral moment"" (?)

C'mon...

Over and over again, Bret Baier attempted to set up that ""gotcha"" moment -- asking a question and immediately jumping in to interrupt the answer -- only to fall flat...
...time after time after time.

Of course, FOX will continue to ""spin"" this every way from Sunday.  I noticed that IMMEDIATELY following the interview, they posted ""recaps"" that didn't resemble anything that actually happened.

In short, FOX ""News"" demonstrably proved that they can't even be counted on to objectively and factually cover an event that happened -- before everybody's eyes -- ON their OWN show.

Face it, FOX -- Bret got his ass whooped.
He WAS the viral moment."
819ys0_G3Qs,Baier knew exactly what he was doing. He claimed that he thought the clip was from Maria Bartoromo yet he introduced it as a Harris Faulkner interview. People saw what a phony you really are Brett
819ys0_G3Qs,Man I used to like this page now it just sounds scripted and one-sided completely and not even just left it sounds radical left
819ys0_G3Qs,If you’re going to quote something be sure to say “end quote”. Otherwise it sounds like what they’re saying is continuing.
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox network is full of crap 💩
819ys0_G3Qs,"Fox lost hundreds of millions of dollars in court because because their hosts lied about Dominion. In order to fight the case, they hired defence attorneys because they werent professional legal experts, but still lost. When Bair went up against VP Harris it was like  watching a rabbit face up to a hunter and try to make out it was going to win the fight. His people are too used to interviewing people like Alina Haba and not serious, intelligent, successful professionals."
819ys0_G3Qs,"It doesn't matter, FOX is going to maintain its course, it has too much money and potential to be the sole propaganda arm of any Trumpan Horse administration where like Florida, they would simply ban anyone that does not tow the line. FOX would be Invasion of the Body Snatchers, first on the scene to every arrest to impress and oppress any dissent... They are chipping at the bit to the the sole media in America, commanding the entire market at will... and all the money and power and privileges and control that come with it. FOX has no people watching, it has foreign enemy soldier moles waiting to take everything away from you, all your memories, all your personal lives, all those things you hold dear for their Party Line-- for a man in a mansion they would serve as bidding, for the sucor of being above."
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox does not use deceptive editing. They lie. Call it what it is.
819ys0_G3Qs,"The thing that the GOP and FOX keep forgetting, is VP Harris is a strong and intelligent woman.  She can wipe the floor with interviewers if she wants too.  She was a prosecutor for many years and an AG for CA.  I mean seriously that's what she's trained to do as a prosecutor and AG.  She knows the law.  They know nothing!"
819ys0_G3Qs,"The only thing Harris could have done better in that interview is to instruct Bret Baier's crew to pull up ""Don't Be a Sucker"" from the US National Archives https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4 and tell him that we're both going to sit here (with his audience) and watch this together."
819ys0_G3Qs,Wait!  Faux is deceptive???  OMG! 😂😂🤯😂😂
819ys0_G3Qs,Fox...you should be happy she even came on your busted a## show.
819ys0_G3Qs,FOX NEWS IS ENTERTAINMENT TV ONLY 😮
819ys0_G3Qs,"I see by the majority of comments there are a lot of hate filled and judgemental people here, gee just like those on the right that they complain about."
819ys0_G3Qs,MAGAs are stupid..............and prove it every day.
819ys0_G3Qs,Harris was great. Fox got their talking points and that's all they care about.
819ys0_G3Qs,Honestly I am getting worried with all the polls saying Trump is leading in all the battleground states. If we get Trump we are all royally fucked!
819ys0_G3Qs,nice vid. I've never been interested to watch this channel before.
819ys0_G3Qs,"I had faith she could hold her own, and she did."
819ys0_G3Qs,"I thought alpha males were supposed to be strong and desirable. MAGAt men are the farthest thing from alpha; weaseling, spineless worms 😖"
819ys0_G3Qs,The question is - is the current polling a massive gaslight? Are the current polls being intentionally skewed?
819ys0_G3Qs,'The hit dog howls' as we say in the South. Vote Blue. Faux needs consequences for their lies. Don't allow them in the press pool since they are not a legitimate news organization and instead -entertain- propagandize their viewers
819ys0_G3Qs,Bret who? He bombed
819ys0_G3Qs,Sadly I don't think anything happy printing now will sway enough people to make a difference one way or another. It's either the cult of Trump or protecting democracy. And it has been since 4 years ago.
819ys0_G3Qs,"""FOX"" not real news network"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Greetings, Belle ✨Respect ✨"
819ys0_G3Qs,Thank you 💙💙💙
819ys0_G3Qs,Cheers from the Pacific West coast of Canada.
819ys0_G3Qs,"The only reason Harris got what she wanted is because Brett was not being a journalist, he was being a propagandist for tRump and Harris knew it.  Brett set himself up to GIVE Harris what she wanted.  
Time in the tRump echo chamber through Fox to knock out one of those Jenga pieces out from the bottom. 
 Harris is a former procecuter and a high level politician.  tRump is a back ally provocateur and school yard carnival barker.  Thinking Harris is at the same low level as tRump is why Brett did not get what he wanted.  And got played."
819ys0_G3Qs,Love you Belle. You explain everything so well.  Keep up the great work
819ys0_G3Qs,"Faux News did their typical white-guy-bully tactics, which VP Harris was NOT having.  None of us Dems are having their complete lies. VP Harris totally owned Bret Baier, and I loved it!"
819ys0_G3Qs,I wasn't worried for a second about Madame Vice President Harris going on Fox. She handed the interviewer his a** and he deserved it! Talk about FAAFO 😂
819ys0_G3Qs,"Harris is very impressive, very impressive indeed.
Happy I voted for her. 💙"
819ys0_G3Qs,Thanks for posting.
819ys0_G3Qs,Nope he lied
819ys0_G3Qs,"Wasn't what he expected ??????????    Yea, i call MAJOR BS on that one !!  Apparently, having to pay a $787,000,000 defamation judgement, hasn't phased FOX FICTION"
819ys0_G3Qs,Did Brett just throw Maria Bartaromo under the bus? Not surprising.
819ys0_G3Qs,We voted in early voting for Harris!
819ys0_G3Qs,"As an undecided voter, I was looking to see if Harris would take accountability for any of the country's problems.  I would vote for her if she would give a single honest assessment of a failing of hers and explain how she would do better.  Is it too late to keep holding out hope for this?"
819ys0_G3Qs,"Fox is notorious for edits and lies, so... Ol' Bret doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. 
Not sorry!"
819ys0_G3Qs,"I am voting for VP Kamala Harris in person on election day. I want to be sure my ballot does not fall victim to the maghat fanatics around here. And if I see any examples of voter harassment, intimidation, or electioneering, I am filing an immediate report to the police."
819ys0_G3Qs,Thank you Belle
819ys0_G3Qs,One tuff interview wow cry me a river foxes ratings are on the rise go Bret finally a reporter that asked so damn questions all she had was Trump Trump Trump Trump. Trump is in her head rent free TDS
819ys0_G3Qs,"I love the goalpost moving.
Kamala has a weird laugh. Kamala won't do interviews without help from Walz.  Kamala gets 60 minutes to edit the interview for her. Kamala only does friendly softball interviews...... She has a weird laugh."
819ys0_G3Qs,I feel like democrats should switch to the Republican Party and vote in the primary so that the odds of getting an insane person are limited in the general.
819ys0_G3Qs,"Fox is not journalism, it’s propaganda. It’s an abuse of the first amendment and they are eroding the peoples trust in journalism, science and political discourse."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Why the patch down side up?
2b8oBxpbRxE,Where is beau????  I like belle too but i miss beau.
2b8oBxpbRxE,🤠🍋‍🟩
2b8oBxpbRxE,Got to love a Catholic Irish President 🤭😉🤗🍀
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Belle, all the Presidents men.....when it happened, I was 16, when it came out, 18.

I thought THAT was a guy buster. Bob is a legend. How he obtains the info that he does, is a miracle!! 

A legend ❤️🇺🇲"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Netanyahu is indeed a bad fascist guy, but words are not enough!"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Can you say Logan Act? Sure you can.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Thank you, Belle and the team!

We must keep tfg out of the White House!

💙V💙O💙T💙E💙 💙B💙L💙U💙E💙"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Is that where we found out that DJT received a burner phone from MBS?
2b8oBxpbRxE,"When Biden was elected he was not my guy, but ya know he has really grown on me. He is also the first president I have had more respect for at the end of his time in office than the beginning."
2b8oBxpbRxE,I already knew President Biden had a very poor feeling toward Bibi.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"If this can be confirmed then Trump needs to be immediately arrested and charged with murder , and anything else DOJ can prove ."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Burnt straw polls; my revenge!
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Strongmen --NOT ""strong men"".  Inflections matter!"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thank you Belle and Team.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"""He admires strong men...""  Daddy Issues."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"The situation with Israel has little to do with Biden and his actions are bound by pre-existing treaties. The primary military treaties (1952 & 1991) are treaties signed by Republican presidents: Ike and Dub-ya Bush.

None of those treaties detail anything about the ethical behavior of the Israeli government...the treaties are trash with zero accountability written in for anyone involved."
2b8oBxpbRxE,I remember clearly when the testing kits disappeared.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Trump has been mirroring Putin’s comments since 2015. He’s definitely stayed in contact. Putin said his grandkid was learning to speak Chinese, recently.  Trump said the same exact thing, in the same week, long before Putin’s remarks were reported abroad. He’s a traitor."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"…and people wonder why he had ALL of our national secrets in his bathroom.  Handing kits to Putin while telling Americans to not take the test, but inject bleach or take horse tranquilizer instead.  At what point does he get arrested? Asking for a friend with lupus who couldn’t get the hydroxchloquine she needed during the pandemic because everyone else swiped it for Covid."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"people are getting this story WRONG.  It was not ""test kits"" it was TESTING MACHINES that could test thousands of samples-- he sent Putin machines for PERSONAL USE that could have supplied HOSPITALS with the means to test THOUSANDS of Americans."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Is anyone surprised by this? He'd betray America to help a hostile foreign leader, what about that makes him qualified to run this country? Hope everything's okay where y'all are. Just got my electricity back a couple hours ago, other than losing all my frozen foods things are good here. We were lucky, considering we were on the north side, with all the rain. There was a tornado not far from here that took some houses, fortunately none of them lost their lives."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Woodward write books faster than I could read them.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Not test kits, test machines."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Well, Biden is right about Netanyahu.  Bob Woodward is quite a reporter, and he does his fact checking.
Have a great day Belle 😊 
Thank you very much 
💙💙👍💙💙🐎"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Bibi is a crook
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thankyou for the true 💙💙💙
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I remember when Biden was Obama's VP. We called him several names. Attack dog, junk-yard dog, and he made gaffs from time to time. Never bothered me, because the GOP was attacking Obama nearly every day. They needed a junk-yard attack dog to get them moving. GOP is the do nothing party who wants to blame all their screw ups on the Dems.
End the GOP, it's dead Jim"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Glad to hear Biden is realistic about Netanyahu and see him for the asshole he is.
2b8oBxpbRxE,I saw that Harris interview on Colbert's Late Show. It's terrific. Thanks for drawing attention to it. I urge all to watch it.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I've said this elsewhere, but Biden really needs to cuss more in public.

And by the way Belle, compliments on how you've seized this thing; my initial reaction was seemed like you were kinda stiff in front of the camera & were a little too ""read-ey,"" but you're really starting to sound a lot more conversational, much more at ease & finding your own voice, which is really great. I know I'm not alone and hoping that this channel continues onward & upward & wish you guys the best."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Biden is right about Netanyahu 💯%!
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Gee, President Biden swears! But Trump- gave a precious resource to Putin- our enemy! People were dying by the thousands and he gave a Covid Testing resource to a Dictator!"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Netanyahu is a bad fucking guy.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Trump stole secret security documents. And was in contact with Putin. What do you think was going on? Fkn traitor should be put under the dir ..I mean jail.
2b8oBxpbRxE,I want to race Biden in his vette so bad but I also want to hear him say the F word out loud in conversation pretty bad.
2b8oBxpbRxE,As to neteyahoo he made it clear he wants genocide on Palestine.  I don't understand why this is so hard to recognize.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Needs another investigation on Trump
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Apparently, ""America first"" is a lie
How ironic 🤔🤷"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"This makes me love Biden even more.   He is a normal person, and cusses like a sailor  just like my mom.  Now I know why I love him 😂😂😂"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"It isn't really news that Biden and Netanyahu hate each other.  Evidence has been out there for a long time.  Now Woodward comes along and says it and it's like Surprise!  And, so far, Belle is the only one who I've seen reporting on it, everyone is focusing on the Covid testing machine to Putin.  It's important because apparently Netanyahu is delaying a cease fire in the hope that Trump wins."
2b8oBxpbRxE,I agree with Biden..
2b8oBxpbRxE,Love from a DeadDomain and Vaush fan!
2b8oBxpbRxE,The Kremlin's denial is confirmation.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Trump said Covid wasn’t a big deal but in his personal life he acted like it was. Which do you believe?
2b8oBxpbRxE,I imagine the downplay spin will be to frame it as supplies sent to the Russian people
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Are you in distress, Belle? I see you have your Curious George patch on upside down. Hope you come through the storm O.K."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Is it just me, or should that kind of information have been passed down to the FBI when that was happening between Putin and Trump after he got out of office, as there's only 1 president and he wasn't it. Thought it was a big no-no discussing foreign policy with world leaders when not in WH..."
2b8oBxpbRxE,President Biden is correct; BB is in this escalating war to keep his jester out of prison. Not a thought to the current or future damage he is causing. His actions guarantee this war will continue for generations after he is gone from this world.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thank you Belle and Team.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Vance's efforts to minimize Woodward's book were not only laughable, they made him look foolish and ignorant."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Netanyahu got that bloodlust
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Trump truly has mastered the art of the deal. He prevented the invasion of ukraine during his term, and all it cost was a couple testing kits /s"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Bob Woodward is the reporter who kept his mouth shut for months regarding how deadly and contagious covid 19 was until it was time to release his book. Woodward's hands aren't clean in the covid disaster. Woodward is no hero. He's an opportunist of the worst kind.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"“American First,” right? 🥸"
2b8oBxpbRxE,So we now know there were secret private conversations between Putin and Trump.  And the MAGA nuts are still crying about Walz taking HS kids to China for exchange trips.
2b8oBxpbRxE,One of the late night comics covered his talking with putin with something along: trump makes call.  Putin answered yes donald what is it. I am shirtless on my horse😂😂😂
2b8oBxpbRxE,💙🌊
2b8oBxpbRxE,"But it's not a thought, it's a book."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Approximately 440 000 American service men and women tragically died during WW2...
More than a million succumbed to COVID under Trump's term in Office.
This tragic loss of live could have been averted...
Complete and utter lack of leadership.

Many people near Trump have noticed that the individual hates be to seen or portrayed as a loser...
Well, this individual is a BIG loser.
""The whole world loves a winner...
And hates a loser.""  😁 ... It is just a matter of time before the 'downfall.'"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Nothing Trump does matters. The soviet style right wing disinformation machine can convince a right leaning man into thinking he's a woman if they want to. They don't believe anything bad about Trump, even if they see it with their own eyes and hear it with their own ears. Right now we're in one of the best economies of my life, but a majority of Americans think we're in a recession due to disinformation and intellectual laziness."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Much ado about nothing.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"according to another news report where they got a response from the Russian ambassador (or other official there), Russia receiving 'testing machine hardware', not tests like we think of today as the home tests. Those were not available yet, or only available to be used in conjunction with the machines (you may recall the entire nose swabbing 'fun' early on in the pandemic?). You may want to post a clarification at the top of the video."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Biden is also guilty for everything that has happened in Gaza.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"""Biden is reportedly not very fond of Netanyahu."" Well no shit Woodward, anyone could have seen that."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Biden and Netanyahu used to be friends! Says a lot about the guy that they aren't now.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"trump is the type of guy to go to a strip club, and then brag to all his friends about how much the girls *REALLY* liked him.."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"As for the Biden quotes, that only makes me like him more. Netanyahu is a war criminal."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I appreciate that this is coming out, but I despise Woodward for sitting on the damning evidence against T****** until he could put it in his book. Once again, it's all about the $$$. And I will NOT be buying his books."
2b8oBxpbRxE,And Oct 16 I’ll get a pir8ed copy. I’m not giving money to a guy who would rather watch our democracy die while he sells books.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"2nd time Woodward has done this-withholding important information from the American ppl so he can sell a book. He did it in 2020, w his book Rage"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"What I don't believe is that Trump and Putin have talked ONLY seven times since Trump was booted out of the White House in 2020.  Putin has been schooling Trump, who everybody knows is not the brightest bulb on the block, in the intricacies of how to become a dictator while making people believe you are their ""savior.""  Once Trump is back in the White House, he'll be to do whatever he wants, because SCOTUS has told him all he has to call whatever he does ""an official act."""
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Thanks, Belle."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"God Bless Joe Biden and our next President, Kamala Harris."
2b8oBxpbRxE,I will submit it happened many more times than seven.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Very interesting information.
Thank you, Belle!💙💙💙💙🌈🇺🇸😃💙❣️"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Chump didn’t bother bargaining for release of Americans when he gave the Covid testing machine to Putin. He’s such a loser
2b8oBxpbRxE,I’ll be interested to hear what’s in the book and what people have to say about it but I won’t give one nickel to someone who withholds vital information from the American public just so he can profit from it.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Really seems like this channel is Propaganda for the DNC now. Nothing ab gaza and no real criticisms of the dems. BB has attacked 4 countries in the region, so keeping it from escalating isnt working, maybe ask why theyre continuing to send weapons to the ""bad f-ing guy"" or why they still parrot the claims of a ""f-ing liar""... sure the election is important but geez"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Biden would still be the candidate if he'd been honest with the public about Bibi....
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Does any other head of state actually like Netanyahu? I remember being a teen in the early 2000sn in Germany, and looking over my dad's shoulder as he read the newspaper. There was a story about how then-president of France Sarkozy and Obama got caught on a hot mike somewhere where they were privately bitching about Netanyahu. Apparently Sarkozy said something to the effect of ""I hate that guy"" and Obama answered something like ""at least you don't have to deal with him every day."" So my impression is that dear Bibi has always been a nightmare to work with."
2b8oBxpbRxE,That’s treason
2b8oBxpbRxE,Was anyone else highly entertained by smiling Belle saying “a word that starts with F”?
2b8oBxpbRxE,"A much, MUCH, worse clarification.... Trump did not send Putin Covid Test ""kits"" (i.e. the boxes of at home kits available now)... he sent them Abbott Labs Covid Test MACHINES...  They were in high demand, and doing so likely caused undetected transmission AND DEATHS.  Trump put Putin over Americans (again!!)."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"""America First!"" -Trump
""What about your old pals, The Rooskies?"" -Putin
""Sir,"" with tears in his eyes, ""Sir, here you go."""
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Yeah, but IDGAF  how ""angry"" Biden is as long as he keeps shipping bombs and ammunition to Israel to continue their genocide.  Biden is like an ineffective parent that keeps yelling at their kid to stop hitting others on the playground, but never stops sipping coffee on the bench while complaining to the other parents about how bad their kid is behaving while also ignoring their advice.  In fact Biden had someone tell everyone else that his kid was in fact NOT misbehaving even though there were official reports of the misbehavior.

I think my metaphor got away from me, just like all those bombs got away from Biden and were dropped on Palestinians."
2b8oBxpbRxE,💙💙💙
2b8oBxpbRxE,Netanyahu a SOB and an effing liar!  I approve this message.  Strangly he's doing the same things Hitler did to the jews in Poland.  Except he's not moving the Palestinians he's killing them on place.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Explains the episodes of PPE around the country at the time.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Are you getting it yet maga ? Your cheeto jebuz is a TRAITOR ! Guess what that makes you ?
2b8oBxpbRxE,Netanyahu is a word that starts with a T: a terrorist. Let's call things by their proper name.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I'm with Biden on that one. ""Bibi"" Netanyahu is a far right wannabe dictator like bone spurs who wants to remain in power indefinitely and manipulates the system to create loop holes for his crimes. He is also a war pig. I support Israelis who recognize this and protest against him and his war."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Agreed. The best benefit of the doubt I can give Woodward is he's trying to October Surprise with this one. Like that worked so well with the Access Hollywood tapes. There is literally no good reason for a knucklehead former president Trump to call any world leaders. Only bad reasons.
2b8oBxpbRxE,The difference here is that Trump's actions were wrong and Biden's words were right.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Most folk agree with Biden's sentiments regarding NuttyYahoo. Most folk disagree with dumold rump_T's subservient worship of Pooptin. Nothing new in Woodward's book.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Afghan man arrested in Election Day terror plot was given special visa under Biden-Harris admin
""I am proud of the men and women of the FBI who uncovered and stopped the plot before anyone was harmed. Terrorism is still the FBI's number one priority, and we will use every resource to protect the American people."""
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward says in his new book ""War"" that President Joe Biden deeply regretted appointing Merrick Garland as his administration’s attorney general after Garland appointed a special prosecutor to dig into Hunter Biden and did not do enough to ease the younger Biden's legal troubles. He also criticizes former President Barack Obama for caving to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Crimea.....“They f*cked up in 2014,” Biden commented to a friend, according to Woodward’s notes. “That’s why we are here. We f*cked it up. Barack never took Putin seriously.”

“We did nothing. We gave Putin a license to continue!” Biden said. “Well, I’m revoking his f*cking license!”    You leftards left this part out of Woodwards book"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Good morning, Belle. Thank you for this. 👍🏼. Is Old 45 a traitor?  Why, yes. Yes he is."
2b8oBxpbRxE,I mean where's the lie? Bibi is a scumbag.
2b8oBxpbRxE,💙💙💙
2b8oBxpbRxE,Oh shit the kremlin confimred the Covid test thing?? I actually wasn't sure if I could believe that.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thank you for keeping us informed Belle. You are doing a great job 👍
2b8oBxpbRxE,"And yet, he still sent money, weapons and troops. Actions are facts. Words mean nothing."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Lol Biden is calling it like it is! Is anyone surprised that the orange menace sent our precious resources to putin when this country needed them desperately? Just more proof that he doesn't give one crap about U.S. citizens. Yet millions of people want him as president? Makes no sense at all
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Goes to show that ""America first"" is just propaganda for R's!"
2b8oBxpbRxE,THANK YOU BELLE
2b8oBxpbRxE,"He's not lying about Bibi an the rest of these Israeli chumps who think that, because of the horrors of the Holocaust, they  now have carte blanche to do whatever they want, to whomever they want, and spread themselves wherever they want, even if that includes unaliving anyone in the way.  It's disgusting."
2b8oBxpbRxE,This is disgraceful behavior by a sitting president.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"You call a spade a spade. People, obviously no one with no one with more power than a vote, thinks as well about the Israeli leadership situation as many do here about the #45.
As for the #45 allegations, come on it isn't out of the realm of possibility."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thanks your good and hubby. ❤
2b8oBxpbRxE,This is all so unreal and scary. Thanks for your comments!
2b8oBxpbRxE,All military aid should be completely stopped permanently to Israel
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Donald is dumb and vain enough to sut for another book interview with Woodward.  Clearly, Woodward can play that orange fool too"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"treason, traitor,trump vote blue"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Wonder if he sent any of the Top Secret folders he had after he left office?
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Trump ""I gotta a secret, nyah!""
Putin ""no you don't""
Trump ""oh yes i do""
Putin ""ok Donald prove it, what is secret!""
Donald spills the national secrets
Putin ""yes Donald, you were right, very good secrets you HAD. I applaud you."""
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Trump explains his reason for this in a story during an interview when he talks about a very rich guy waiting to get into a restaurant, so he called them and used his office as president to get his buddy to the front of the line. Outstanding leadership quality for a dictator."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Doesn't matter what Biden calls (or thinks about) Netanyahu, only what he does.  And I don't see him *doing* anything."
2b8oBxpbRxE,One of your best updates. Hate to see Joe go.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"You're so [word that starts with 'F'] cute! 😂😊
You're doing a great job ... obvious who wins the Queen of Sarcasm award in y'alls relationship."
2b8oBxpbRxE,I love Dark Brandon!  Calling Israel’s version of #45 out!
2b8oBxpbRxE,💖
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Won't happen but I would love if Drumpf was impeached again, convicted, and barred from holding office.  After all, there's nothing saying they can't impeach a former office holder, regardless of what the GOP claimed before.  New evidence, new crimes, they could impeach him again.  

And the SCOTUS immunity ruling wouldn't protect him there.


Won't happen though, the GOP won't act against the interest of their own power grab, even if it's in their own best interests long-term."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Of course trump is in contact with putin. He's gotta sell those classified secrets he stole to someone. How else will he pay all his legal bills?
2b8oBxpbRxE,I heard Arabia gave trump a whole bunch of burner phones to talk to Putin on.  Heard on MSNBC or Miedas Touch.
2b8oBxpbRxE,wow Netanyahu is a bad person whos only goal is self preservation and genocide. that must have come as a shock to biden because its not like the rest of the world has been saying this for a lone time. Biden living under a rock is kinda pathetic. So much for the best country in the world when the past leaders have been a supporter of genocide and someone who tried to end democracy.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Thanks, you are doing a fine job. Keep it up."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Body language when trump and putin are together is very telling. Trump with shoulders slumped and head down. Trump with head up and shoulders wide. Putin has dirt on try. Bad dirt.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thank you Belle💙 Vote Early 🗳️🇺🇸🌊💙💙
2b8oBxpbRxE,So Biden correctly understands the Netanyahu is a F***** but will not do anything to stop the genocide of  the Palestinians in Gaza or others and bombing and killing of others in Lebanon or Yemen.  What the F**** is the matter with Biden.  The only thing that is going to change Netanyahu's behavior in this is cutting off the arms that are enabling his despicable behavior.
2b8oBxpbRxE,💙💙🐴🐴
2b8oBxpbRxE,NOT BUYING HIS STUPID BOOK! He sold America out for $$$$!
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I just wish that some real, true, genuine patriot would slap the s**t out of DJT and call him out as the blatant, bald faced liar that he truly is."
2b8oBxpbRxE,How long did Woodward sit on this information?
2b8oBxpbRxE,"No collusion, huh?  Someone, please explain the deffinition of collusion to the MAGATrumpers.."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"At this stage of the game there's not much more one can say about Trump that would make him any more loathsome.  Shout out to Biden.  Calling a spade a spade.  Thanks for the post, Belle."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thanks for the continued sanity in the ocean of idiocy!
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Thank you,Belle. tRUMP has been Putin’s marionette since the early 2000’s. “We get all the money we need from Russia” an amazing quote from Eric tRUMP. These treasonous people need to be jailed.💙🇺🇸"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"i swear we heard about the tests thing years ago, or was it ppe?"
2b8oBxpbRxE,This may be a sign that Putin no longer thinks Trump is useful.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Remember the documents case that was dismissed? We need to know how these phone calls with Putin and the Saudi prince intersect.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Powerful people don't suck up to 'strong men'.  It is the weak who fawn on them. Trump is really an emotional and moral coward. Always have been.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"These supposed phone calls between Trump and Putin since he left the White House should be grounds to have all of Trump’s phones bugged.  Clearly some spying needs to go on there.  

As for Netanyahu, if Biden didn’t realize what he was actually up to by now, there’s a problem.  It has been clear to me that Netanyahu had two goals he’s setting out to complete.   1 - End this two state agreement with the Palestinians.  His bombing Gaza is intentional.  He wants to flatten all of it to make it completely unlivable.   And killing as many Palestinians as possible in the same breath just makes it all the more glorious for Israel.  The IDF clearly share this sentiment because they continue killing Palestinians even when it is not necessary.  A tell-tell sign when they fired and killed more than a hundred running behind the trucks bringing in food and supplies.   They have some lame excuse that was for sure a lie. 

The other goal Netanyahu is out to make is to end the voting of a new Prime Minister.  He wants to stay in power indefinitely.  The war(s), plural, are intended to also stop any chance of an election he would surely lose.  And he has the United States to give him unlimited weapons to keep as war going almost indefinitely.  But his bombs to Iran are particularly dangerous and concerning."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Vote trump, not tramp"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Personally I'm surprised Biden didn't get caught on hot mikes more often. A little bit more of Dark Brandon might have set a few people (MTG?) Back on their heels and put them in their place
2b8oBxpbRxE,"No Donald, the stripper, in fact, does not like your hat."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"*For Trump, it's Russia First...!*"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Hey, at least this one doesn't seem to have any interviews that go unreleased for months while hundreds of of thousands of people die due to a pandemic, the deadliness of which is directly acknowledged in the interview while it's being publicly downplayed."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Never forget: 100,000 Americans died of Covid before TFG even acknowledged it as a problem.😮"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I’m glad Biden doesn’t trust Bibi, but then for the love of God, stop sending them weapons!!"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Maga accepts trump as a Rapist, Adulterer, Fraud, Conman and a Felon. Will proven traitor be the thing to make them walk away? Vote blue and keep America great!"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Can we please quit calling them “strong men”??!! They’re absolute human garbage.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Nobody cares. I mean yeah, we all do, but the country as a whole doesn’t.

I know it’s not productive or even accurate, but I really feel like the vast majority of this country is stupid.  

Look at the latest RCP averages, it seems everything that should be hurting Trump seems to be helping him."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Yeah, he doesn't like BB, but he will still do whatever BB wants. That is why the Genocide is still happening"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I live in Delaware.  Although I've never met him, his reputation for ""colorful"" language is legend here. I've heard that he had to practice saying ""malarky"" in speeches and other public venues.  Listen to some speeches and just fill in whatever naughty word you want for malarky.  That's likely much closer to what he was thinking."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Trump should have sent Putin hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thank you
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Basic facts: Netanyahu is a fkn liar with no strategy for Gaza. He's a war criminal since long ago and he's not helping his country. He may not be stupid but he's definitely making stupid decisions for Israel to help himself and his party. It's not hard to see. The next generation of Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists are currently being radicalized with his actions as their inspiration. Either he doesn't understand this simple truth, or he doesn't care. Take your pick, but either way, he's a shite leader."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Naziyahu lives down to the name again.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"So Biden, with vastly more information than me, has come to the same conclusion as me about Netanyahu"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Trump’s FIRST WHITE HOUSE VISITOR was the Russian ambassador, Totally secret from US. We found out about it when photos were published in Russian media,"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Biden's private comment makes the lack of policy change even more ridiculous. If a ""friend"" never listens to your advice, always does something wrong, and gets themselves into trouble, at some point, you have a duty to stop enabling them and stop being a ""friend."""
2b8oBxpbRxE,Trump. A man who doesn't realise the club he wants to be in is filled with members who think of everybody else in the same way he thinks of everybody else.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"That Bibi is a f*ing liar we all know, same that he is escalating the ME conflict at every turn to avoid the jail time that is awaiting him for his corruption, same as the orange one, Putin and all the other dictators. Thats not a coincidence that is the MO of dictators."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Good ole Bob ... make that $$$, bro 🙄."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Does anyone remember when Trump destroyed the American translator’s notes after a conversation with Putin and then only used Russian translators afterwards? And yet, people will swear up and down that he’s not Putin’s lap dog."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I dont watch this channel often, but what happened to Beau? He hasnt been around lately."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I've already pre-ordered Woodward's new book. Can't wait to read it. I'm of an age that I can remember what Woodward, along with Carl Bernstein, did to Richard Nixon."
2b8oBxpbRxE,There's no level of depravity TFG will stoop to that would make his cult leave him.  None.  There lies the problem.  These people aren't going away if he loses.  They're nuts.
2b8oBxpbRxE,If trump gets back in the white house the world will see how cozy they are...... If we fuck around we WILL find out.
2b8oBxpbRxE,And he held it up to sell a fucking book instead of telling people immediately.  What a shitty thing to do.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Remember when Woodward, MONTHS after the fact, released information that Trump knew how bad COVID was early on and yet claimed it was just like a flu?  Trump lied and people died, and the GOP walked right in lockstep with him."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thanks Belle and vote Harris Blue Heart 💙 🩵
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Hmm. Word that starts with ""f""?  Is it ""falsidical""?  As in a ""falsidical liar""? 🤔

And ""b"".  A word that starts with ""b"".  Could it be ""balatron"", as in ""that son-of-a-balatron""? 🤔

Stay curious.  💛💙"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"So, the irony is that it's Biden who (at least in private) is the kind of ""tough talker"" that Trump's Idiot Lemming Brigade thinks their Dear Leader is... and only ""thinks"", mind you."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Putin loves Trump because he’s a starry eyed easy mark… there’s a REASON Putin doesn’t like Biden… 😮
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thanks Belle
2b8oBxpbRxE,"My eyebrows have been raised for so many years now, long before Trump, that it has become a permanent condition. That’s OK, they’re kind of bushy, anyway. 😁 It’s my version of the upside down patch."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Belle, are you sure it is a good idea to continue to pronounce strongmen as ""strong men"", with an audible space to make it into an adjective in front of a noun? -- Instead as ""strongmen"" as a form of leader in a primitive jungle society?"
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Well, Obama didn't like Bibi either, and yet he did a TON for Israel - more than most people know. Plus, right now, MOST Israelis would agree with Biden about Bibi. He is a son of a b**** who only cares about his own political position, and is a f***ing LIAR to boot, not to mention the three criminal trials going on against him right now. Bibi doesn't want to go to jail, and he'll do anything he can politically to stop that from happening, even at the expense of his OWN citizens. Sound familiar?????"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Obviously President Biden's opinion of the Israeli Prime Minister aligns with a majority of Americans.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Wow that’s heavy!
2b8oBxpbRxE,"In other news, Biden is aware that water is wet."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Before Trump goes to jail, he'll flee to Russia."
2b8oBxpbRxE,Drump is a walking national security threat.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"""He (Netanyahu)'s a bad guy. He's a bad f**king guy.""

He's not wrong. 😒"
2b8oBxpbRxE,Thanks Belle.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"I don't care if Biden personally called Netanyahu up to swear at him for twenty minutes straight, at the end of the day he's still supporting that lying SOB bad guy's genocide."
2b8oBxpbRxE,I have no problem with Biden being honest with how he feels :)
2b8oBxpbRxE,"So was woodward the fly on the wall when all this stuff was actually happening?  How do we know?  Naturally, America is always right and is the victim."
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Trump sounds like a useful idiot, mean while Putin sounds like a KGB handler handling a asset in a foreign country."
2b8oBxpbRxE,The Kremlin is no longer denying that Donnie sent them covid materials
2b8oBxpbRxE,is this supposed to make me dislike Biden?  because it's having the exact opposite effect.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"Never forget, once in the CIA always in the CIA.
Sounds like absolute BS talking points to make murica look more moral than you lot really are."
2b8oBxpbRxE,These two are the worst. Can't imagine why anyone would vote for that guy.
2b8oBxpbRxE,Trump = the most useful Russian asset in recent years. Is it any wonder why Putin wants him back in the WH?
2b8oBxpbRxE,"An entire political party is supporting this Felonious, cheating, stealing, piece of former Presidential fecal matter. We should vote Blue, then compromise with those same scumbags?"
2b8oBxpbRxE,So why are we still shipping arms to Israel 🙄
2b8oBxpbRxE,Bb is so bad that the administration gave them 18 billion in arms.
2b8oBxpbRxE,"""Bad f*ing guy"" is a bit of an understatement for the guy in charge of a genocide"
gPKkIkEnZw8,18 million votes lost in the post.
gPKkIkEnZw8,No. It was not peaceful. It was something else...
gPKkIkEnZw8,What's  with Ben's tough guy look? Needs rearranging
gPKkIkEnZw8,You can tell Ben is smart enough to know his own words are BS but he has too little integrity and he bought in too strongly to his libertarian world view long ago to change course at this point
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro protecting his status as a spineless human being and getting shown the ropes because of it.
gPKkIkEnZw8,I love Ben but who did his eyebrows 😅😂 bro its to  hight of a angle and way to thick not size but color. And left is to skinny with the s turn. Right is a thick line.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Sam is an idiot!
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Guess what Ben! Kamala conceded. 
And there was no storming the Capitol. 
Trump didn’t even have Biden over  after he won the election. 
He acted like a baby and even left the White House locked so Biden wouldn’t be able to get in. 
So childish, just like the rest of his MAGA Cult."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Um, Jan. 6th WAS an exercise to thwart the peaceful transition of power.  I am watching this post-election and the Democrats did NOT challenge the results. Furthermore, Kamala Harris graciously conceded defeat."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben can make himself interesting in some ways but man he just blew himself up in the end there. Doesn't know who Putin wants to win.. give me a fucking break.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Wow.  I consciously decided 2 yrs ago not to listen to Harris.  I see that he still suffers from chronic TDS.  OK, back to silencing this jack/ff.."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben’s in way over his head against Sam Harris. Doesn’t help that he was gunning for an objectively corrupt criminal. Sadly, he got his wish."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben is so annoying riding Trumps mushroom 🍄… I like listening to debate on different viewpoints, but I have to turn this off at the 12 minute mark because I can’t handle this guy‘s obsession with Trump."
gPKkIkEnZw8,5:45 Will Ben at least react to this now?
gPKkIkEnZw8,Best record in the Middle East? How so?
gPKkIkEnZw8,"When you look up “bad faith” on google, Ben Shapiro’s face is the first 103 results."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Trump and these two knuckleheads lack the intelligence of Adolf Hitler. Great speechifying but poor “doers”, like Shapiro on the violin."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"There was not a peaceful transfer of power as many Republicans have been claiming.  Trump did everything he could to hold onto the power he had.  Trump is also the first president to not go to the inauguration of the next president since 1869, which JD Vance has made false claims about.   ""Since Trump did not attend the inaugural ceremony—becoming the first outgoing president to not attend since Andrew Johnson in 1869  [97]—and did not communicate with Biden directly since the second presidential debate of the 2020 campaign, this tradition was not upheld.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden"
gPKkIkEnZw8,January 6th   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqmTeAEUha4&rco=1&ab_channel=CaptainCandor
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben is so intellectually dishonest. I'm surprised he hasn't equated Biden remarrying to Trump's blatant infidelity.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro is such a dumbass piece of shit I had to stop watching after Harris spoke at the beginning.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben Shapiro, you looking forward to a Christian Nation? Get ready to convert buddy."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"This clip is like an adult arguing with a child. There is much to be said, but in the interest of brevity let us address two pieces that appear to be the obvious core.

8:21 Mr. Harris rightly points out how Hillary Clinton conceded the 2016 election within 24 hours. And if he had it to do over again, because concession and attendance of the subsequent inaugural are the two most important signals of a peaceful transfer of power, I believe Mr. Harris would surely add the important fact that Mrs. Clinton attended Donald Trump’s inauguration. Because as everybody knows, Mr. Trump refused to do either concession or attendance, thus the contrast could hardly be more clear. So, it is utterly disingenuous to draw an equivalence between the way Clinton and Trump questioned election results.

15:26 Mr. Shapiro makes a statement of such profound ignorance that I felt confident saying this was an adult arguing with a child. Mr. Shapiro literally said “foreign policy is not all that complex and not all that nuanced.” This statement is so absurd as to be laughable, especially in light of the fact that the main example Mr. Shapiro uses is the conflict in the middle east, a conflict which is the very definition of complexity and nuance.

15:55 Because of the absurdity of Mr. Shapiro’s foreign policy claim, Mr. Harris asks nearly a perfect question about who Putin wants to win the 2024 election. And, the way Mr. Shapiro dodges said question is an important data point proving the utterly disingenuous nature of Mr. Shapiro’s claims.

Today is November 10, 2024, and I am still interested in identifying common ground between the governing philosophies of conservatives and liberals. But, finding said common ground will be nearly impossible as long as one side is so thoroughly detached from basic facts and reality. And, I write that last sentence with much caution and after much reflection.

I understand, as a rule effective governance comes down to competing value systems. But there is one exception to that rule, and that exception is both sides need their first value to be the actual truth. In other words, because he is an attorney Mr. Shapiro would surely agree that giving deference to the truth is the definition of “acting in good faith.”

In the interest of unity must we abandon truth?"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Well, Ben, you were wrong. The election is over , Harris has coincide, Biden has said the peace transfer of power will move forward. No mass election fraud out cry like the orange baby did and still does. I will add that you said Jan 6 was an insurrection and Trump should ever be allowed in the White House."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Shapiro taking an L as usual.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"I think Sam paints a good perspectivce here. Their 'party', 'supporter's, 'mob', or however you classify them will cry foul, but the sitting dem president won't activley push against the notion it was stolen to try and stay in office. Just saw this tweet, and there's hundreds and thousands of them like it. But Harris will and is going to leave office, peacefully.

Dear 
@POTUS
 There are 20 million votes MISSING. 

No way there were 20 million fewer votes than 2020 with a massive 25 million surge in voter registration and record turnout. 

NO WAY."
gPKkIkEnZw8,oh gosh. Ben Shapiro's voice.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Sam Harris is a fraud and I absolutely can not believe he still gets these gigs. The man is an idiot in matters politic. The election is over Sam. Move on.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"'08: Obama 69 million votes
'12: Obama 65 million votes
'16: Clinton 65 million votes
'20: Biden 81 MILLION VOTES
'24: Harris 66 million votes

Suuuuure, Biden clearly won fair and square. No shenanigans whatsoever. 15+ million people voted mail in ballots because of Covid. And that same 15+ million decided NOT to vote in 2024. Suuuuuure. Totally believable. TDS is a real thing."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben won. Sorry dems.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Watching this post election, Ben was demonstrably wrong about everything. If he had an ounce of the intellectual honesty he pretends to have, he would adjust his viewpoints to reflect actual reality, but of course he will just double down and continue to grift like he has for the past decade."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"15:00 - ""For ""supposedly"" humanitarian reasons""? Umm, what? What else would the reason be, sir? Man this guy is so disingenuous."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben  Shapiro is a boot licker, a twerp, and the most pedantic annoying person on earth and the Right calls this ""intellectualism"""
gPKkIkEnZw8,"It’s really great to see this video after the election and see how completely arrogant and self-absorbed Ben Shapiro is on how things are gonna go, but it turned out that the election was much closer to what Sam Harris was talking about. And have we heard any election denial? Has Kamala Harris come out and undermine the results of the election, no none of that happened. Ben Shapiro, you are a dishonest interlocutor who cannot face the topic at hand and will constantly shift to a Democratic blame game that makes you look like an indoctrinated tool at all times."
gPKkIkEnZw8,I use to respect you Sam Harris. Nowadays you so deep in to your own mid you cant recognized anymore what your own society needs. Here example. TRUMP WON! :D  take some DMT and stick to philosophy!
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Im not even an US citizen. But Sam Harris has ever made a good point? in anny thing?I have hear him for years, but i realice more and more, that he is a smart man, that seams to take a stance in things, but the reasons he made are just his opinions. Nothing less, nothing more."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Well Shapiros election denial claim from the left hasn't happened
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Harris is intelligent, but he comes off like such a smug douchebag."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Reality proved shapiro wrong.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben Shapiro is a hypocrite, apologetic straw-man."
gPKkIkEnZw8,The million dollar question is WHY did the Russians want Trump to win? I know the answer but I urge anyone reading this to consider it for themselves.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Lol who is this guy sam Harris why is this idiot relevant.
gPKkIkEnZw8,I mean Ben Shapiro speaks fast that’s his claim to fame. Not that he thinks fast 😂
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben shapiro is a disengenous, lying conman. There is no two ways about it."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"A very unbiased and concise snd balanced take by sam. Even though i disagree with sam in many things especially regarding gaza, this was extremely well articulated by sam"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"That America thinks a person such as Donald Trump is the right man to be President is genuinely, genuinely depressing. America is not, nor does it have the decent moral center I fooled myself that it did. Kamala Harris? I mean, who cares. I'd have voted for Elmer Fudd before a man such as this."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"5:45 Ben: ""I promise you, if Trump wins this election, you will see election denialism on the left""
that's where you were wrong, Ben."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Wheres Ben Shapiro now that the left has accepted the loss of the election. Unlike the narcissistic lunatics on the right
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Well this didnt age well ... gone sour in less than a week. Dr harris intimate knowledge of mr trump's thoughts, intentions and feelings amazes me."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Boy, was Ben Shapiro wrong, again!"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"The best thing that could happen, is unfettered Trump. Either he'll prove all his detractors wrong, and we can admit that he's genius businessman who should be running the country. Or (and far more likely), his lies will come back, and things will get worse. Then people will realize how much of a fraud he is. 

Ben is wrong on everything in this vid. Trump didn't leave peacefully. So far, the Dems have conceded the election, they are working to transition with Trump, and Trump is not working with them."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben you got this wrong ... no claims from KH that the election was not fair
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Sam Harris is a prime example of TDS. Anytime people use fascism, naziism, etc it makes them ignorant of actual history and also tries to take European politics, let alone EU politics of the 30s and 40s, and act like its 1:1"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben is genuinely not worth talking to imo. Please have more interesting interviews.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Sam Harris is a tool
gPKkIkEnZw8,14:50 hawk tuah?
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Didnt hear any claims that the election was rigged, in particular by Kamala Harris"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"I would be surprised if Thump and his new administration of ghouls and grifter didn’t crash the economy by 2026.  We are super fucked, especially if you are a sane and decent person."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Why would you Sam. Shapiro is a whiny pseudo intellectual. Don't even give these idiots space. Let them stay home on their keyboards wanking to porn.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Trump's camp has openly stated it wants to pull out of NATO and deprive Ukraine of arms and Ben is having trouble intuiting whom the Kremlin supports. Ben is not stupid, he's a liar and propagandist and should be treated as such, this is not a serious person."
gPKkIkEnZw8,mommy and daddy are fighting again
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Yeah,  Ben will be fucked if he goes against the new Trump Party."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Watching Shapiro fail going up against anyone that’s not a college freshman gotta be one of my favorite genres.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Hey Ben … where’s the election denialism on the left???
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Sam Harris is in love with his own voice. Don't think anyone else can stand it anymore. He can either talk to himself or join the 
Lincoln project"
gPKkIkEnZw8,They shot & killed unarmed Ashli Babbit
gPKkIkEnZw8,Look at the bitterness in his face 😔  Someone should check on him to see how he's doing after Trump landslide victory
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro was WRONG!!!
gPKkIkEnZw8,5:44 aged like milk
gPKkIkEnZw8,"It is sad that Ben Shapiro has degraded so much. I used to think that he is honest and intellectual. Sam Harris is amazing, as always!"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Genocide supporter.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben was wrong (as usual).
gPKkIkEnZw8,"""He is not a man of ideas on any level."" Really. Not one level. Not on the economic level? Military level? No level huh?🤔"
gPKkIkEnZw8,The best argument against trump.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Kamala lost for the same reason Hillary lost. Democrats failed to vote. Democrats stayed home. Trump received the same number of votes as he did in 2020 74 million. Kamala received 70 million votes. 11 million fewer votes than Biden did in 2020.
gPKkIkEnZw8,She lost in a landslide and conceded the very next day. So we know what Kamala Harris has done and Ben's claims now is bs.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Honest question: why would you commit to a peaceful transfer of power if there’s a chance that power will be stolen? Sam has said himself, quite literally, that he would advocate a nuclear first strike against a country that would nuke us first. It sounds extreme, but it makes sense logically, just as leaving the option open to not conceding power peacefully if the election was stolen."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro is a moron
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Funny how when Ben debates someone actually intelligent who pushes back on his incessant bullshit, he becomes much more restrained in spewing fallacies."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"after the cut, my intuition says that Ben might be Putin's guy"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Trump won and in a landslide  as you said was a high probability and the transfer of power by the president was indeed peaceful and graceful.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"January 6th was, without a doubt, the absolute worst catastrophe in the entire history of humankind. The terrifying mastermind, Donald Trump, orchestrated this brilliantly strategic assault on the U.S. Capitol—complete with an elite squad of supporters wielding signs and sporting bizarre costumes. Every single person across the United States who watched it unfold on TV was, naturally, paralyzed with fear as our democracy hung by the thinnest of threads.

And then, after a short recess, Congress courageously reconvened, and none other than Mike Pence himself valiantly saved the entire nation by certifying the election. This unforgettable chapter in our history will forever be etched in our textbooks as the nightmarish day democracy was nearly obliterated. Never forget! Everything we hold dear was almost lost for all eternity.

As for the poor, traumatized members of Congress—forced into a two-hour recess—they will surely carry the burden of PTSD from this harrowing ordeal for the rest of their lives. NEVER FORGET!!!"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"You can see in Ben's eyes during parts of this that he knows he's full of shit. 😂. Total bullshit from Ben, per usual."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben is such a fucking weasel with his arguments, holy shit"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"The moral Landscape was one of my favourite books over a decade ago! Sam Harris in 2024 is a completely different person a possessed person, quite upsetting and sad to watch."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Sam is hot trash.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben’s question at 12:00 is absolutely ridiculous. If Sam DID want Kamala not to certify the election, Ben would obviously say that makes Dems the same as Trump. Sam doesn’t want that but Ben still tries to use that against him in the debase. Beyond absurd."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"So Ben shitpiro, did VP Harris contest the election? Dude you sound like a cartoon character and you have an intellect to match it😅"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"So Ben said we’ll see election denial on the left if Trump wins. 

Well, he won, and Kamala conceded, and no one is denying it."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben is an idiot. The certification of the results of the election is part of the transfer of power and that process wasn’t peaceful. Fucking duh
gPKkIkEnZw8,Trump just announced Pompeo will not join his administration. Proving that Shapiro was just talking rubbish about his internal knowledge of the campaign moves. So full of
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Yay. Non-Idiot vs Idiot, I wonder who won?????"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Obviously Ben's claim of both sides-ism did not come to pass, not even a little bit, and was never based in reality. There was a clear result as Sam hypothesized, and Harris conceded graciously without incident. Get off the see-saw Ben, the rot is not equal in both parties."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Perhaps not listening to sound bites and you wont be morally confused Sam Harris.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Oh this clip aged deliciously. It was a decisive victory and NO ONE on the left is questioning the legitimacy of the election results. Harris conceded and Bidem already committed support to peaceful transfer of power. We really need to hold these talking heads accountable when they get it wrong because they are actively shaping perception. The double standard is ridiculous if the results were in the other direction. Its lose lose for dems.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"What all of you should be concerned about (regardless of who won in 2020) is the fact that those in power interfered with the election by censoring the likes of Twitter, Facebook, and other media outlets."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Let’s microwave manage the truth Ben!
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Actual context to ""the peaceful transfer"" of power is helpful. Here, youtu.be/PYRYXhU4kxM?si=yf2t_h7NgTDEE2g_&t=339 you can get a bit.
Just imagine that every possible thing is rigged against the Dems in the next election, and the Dem candidate is asked, ""Will you pre-commit that you will accept the results of an election?""
If Sam weren't such a sophist he'd bring such balance to the question."
gPKkIkEnZw8,The reason the landslide example is more relevant is because Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by a landslide
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben the left did not deny the election you were wrong.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro looks like a Thunderbirds character.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro needs to stick to debating college kids lol
gPKkIkEnZw8,"What Trump did, and continues to do, is indefensible."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"If we treat Trump as a common politician and his followers as common political supporters, we would miss it completely and come out with wrong conclusions.

In order to understand Trump, his followers, and this phenomenon, we need to start with these facts:

1. Thousands of his supporters attacked the USA capitol and many went to jail for him.

2. Donald Trump: 'I Could ... Shoot Somebody, And I Wouldn't Lose Any Voters'

Trump has millions of such devoted supporters who cheer and support his every move. They treat him like a God, a Messiah. 

Logic doesn’t work. Reason doesn’t work. Facts and data are irrelevant. Many politicians, journalists have already understood it and they have already surrendered and aligned or have left the public arena. Now even smart billionaires like Elon Musk have realized and have offered their allegiance. 

Threat this like a religion and you might begin to understand. If you don’t, you will remain confused forever. This is not about logic, rationality or data."
gPKkIkEnZw8,And the winner here is Shapiro
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Its crazy how beautifully this aged for Sam. Kamala conceded immediately, and there was no uprising like Ben said."
gPKkIkEnZw8,I have all the respect in the world for Sam Harris. However I am a little disappointed with his emotions towards Trump.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Look how absolutely wrong Shapiro was!
gPKkIkEnZw8,"So ben agrees that trunp tried to stop the transfer of power, and it was stopped because pence opposed it. Now that he has filled the gov with sycophants he wont try again? Ben cant be this dumb."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Religiously your sooooo spot on but you can’t seem to understand why people like trump
gPKkIkEnZw8,Dude Sam your getting your ass handed to you in this debate and I think your usually right
gPKkIkEnZw8,Crazy how much Sam knows when it comes to thinking about the world but when I see how much TDS he has it really makes me question all of his ideas
gPKkIkEnZw8,Has someone done a wellness check on Sam?
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Post election, this clip did not age well for Shapiro. He was proven wrong and Sam was right."
gPKkIkEnZw8,2 jews debate over what's good for white Europeans lol
gPKkIkEnZw8,Hilarious to watch this after the election and Ben is so completely wrong prognosticating about Harris contesting the election.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Funny how maga uses the same terms over and over. “Word salad” is laughably ironic. Trump served up word buffets with word salad bar included .
gPKkIkEnZw8,This video sides on the side of Trump looking back 8 days ago.  As most of the country voted Trump
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Thank you Sam......like many, so sorry for what happened this week in the election.  Stay strong."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Seems like there was no election denialism at all Ben?
gPKkIkEnZw8,This didn't age well at all for Ben Shapiro. Kamala gracefully conceded and pledged a peaceful transfer of power. Something Trump has never done.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"As a Conservative i had to, for the first time in my life, vote in opposition. Trump is just an unhinged, wingnut, criminal and it is cringeworthy to hear Ben in this video. Ben is being dishonest and reactionary here which worries me."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Kamala conceded..... The right knows nothing
gPKkIkEnZw8,Sam was just exhausted with Ben Shapiro's utter nonsense. I feel that on a deep level.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Urgh listening to this for 10 minutes, just can't listen to shapiro anymore, guy is full of shit. He's got no actual arguments just baseless emotional drivel. Can't believe anyone holds this dude in any regard."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"I'm already in Sam's camp, but this logical and in (my opinion) objective breakdown of trumpism is hard to argue... Seems like a lonely voice in the desert now more than ever, people who adhere to critical thinking and the elegancy of the style of mr. Harris are few and far between."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"But there WAS Russian interference that contributed to Trump's win in 2016.   Why did Flynn lie to the FBI about having contact with the Russians during the campaign?  Lying to the FBI is a felony.  Lies are told to hide the truth.  Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI.  Why did he feel like he needed to lie?   The same is true for Manafort, and Papadopoulos, and  Gates.   Trump says everything is ""fake"" about the Russia investigation.  The only thing that's fake about the Russia investigation is the Trump presidency."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben was wrong.
gPKkIkEnZw8,12:44 is peak sam harris.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"It’s been proven that the the Steele dossier was fabricated and the whole thing was a hoax. 
How tf is Hillary not in prison?
We just glossing over that Sam? 😂"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"The people voted for Bernie, but the party didnt appoint him as the candidate.....choosing Hilary instead.  The Democrat party ignored the people's selection.   Yet the Democrats accuse the Republicans of destroying democracy.    Fascinating huh?"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Sam Harris has lost it. He just assumes the motives of someone he doesn’t know personally, and then he attacks those things. It’s not a humble or honest way to judge a politician."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Your opinion means nothing if your religion control you.
gPKkIkEnZw8,We need a 2.0 debate on this.  Shapiro was wrong
gPKkIkEnZw8,So Ben was 100% wrong. I well expect admission will be forthcoming.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Watching this on November 8th and what ben said at 5:48 was as wrong as hes ever been about anything
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Election is over - NONE of what Ben Shapiro predicted the Dems would do actually happened. But of course, none of it matters. We're a doomed society of Debate Lords"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Smart articulate individuals arguing about their choice of which of the lesser idiot should rule America. The state of American politics is seriously sad 😂😂😂
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro is arguing in just the worst terms imaginable and living in cloud cuckoo land with his 2020 was a peaceful transfer of power!
gPKkIkEnZw8,"While it is true that Trump is not ideological , 
Trump will say whatever if it gets the results he wants,
If Trump was told his best chance of winning the election was as a democrat…
Then he would have run as a democrat 

While Trump may not have an ideology, those people behind him do, the people pulling his strings 
It’s those people who are the danger"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Does anyone still speak to this sneaky little lap-dog of all groups evil?
gPKkIkEnZw8,"There is, in fact, election denialism on the left as we speak haha"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Shapiro is just another right wing grifter at this point. He will not go against the current MAGA trend because money means more to him than principles.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"It’s so lovely to see how wrong Ben is in this segment. Every. Single. Sentence was Wrong! after the election, it just shows how much of a grifting weirdo Ben actually is. His brain has melted!"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"god, murkans are so far up themselves."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Yea...except looking at the last several elections...where did 15 million dem votes go this time?
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Eh, heh! 😆"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Watching this two days after the election, it's so clear that Sam Harris is grounded in reality, and Ben is just plain wrong, wrong, wrong. He sounds smart but is such a fool."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Listening to Ben makes me nauseous. Really a nasty person
gPKkIkEnZw8,Funny how when Trump won Harris concede and all the Democrats acknowledged that she lost and Trump won Benny
gPKkIkEnZw8,Anybody else here 3 days after the election to see if Kamala didnt concede to the election results?
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben is an example of an intelligent person who is simultaneously stupid at the same time. His brain works fast and he knows a lot of facts but he lacks the ability to connect facts in a rational way to the truth.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"So Trump won on a “landslide” and as predicted by Sam both Harris and Biden have not only conceded, but will help the Trump administration move in.. we all now what would have happened if it had been Harris wining on a landslide"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben is definitely dyeing his hair and eyebrows
gPKkIkEnZw8,Russia Russia Russia? Still? Did you not hear the news? Didn’t happen.
gPKkIkEnZw8,I'm a Muslim and I voted for Trump.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro just pulling the wool over your eyes
gPKkIkEnZw8,Soooo it’s been 48 hours and no democratic election denialism that Ben promised. I’m waiting for him to update us on his promise we were going to see……
gPKkIkEnZw8,"There's always illegal activity with elections, so it just comes down to _how much?_

The 2020 election was so over-the-top rigged, with blatant empirical evidence.  I've never been aligned with any political party, nor am I a Trump sycophant; I'm pointing out matter-of-fact information.  So at that point, all you can do is debate on how Trump handled the deep state stolen election.  A constitutional republic (which kamala/their team doesn't even know) did a very undemocratic thing, and that's all I can say on that."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben just talks fast and over people to make himself feel correct.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"I _used_ to watch and respect Ben Shapiro, until several years back I just couldn't anymore.  Leaving out blatant atrocities that Israel has done, _never_ talking about any news that involves jews (like expounding on what they consider ""hate speech"", etc.); I just can't with a zionist jew.  Your kids going to hebrew school, living in a jewish community, all that is totally great...but when your a sycophant to Israel, nope.

I'm not pro or anti Israel or Palestine, I'm pro America.  Ben is anything but an unbiased journalist...playing identity politics where the jews do no wrong."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Well this didn’t age well.  I guess ben was wrong and he should clarify time has shown his implication to be more fallacious then he believed it to be.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Something that would make me respect the right just a bit more is if they said “yes, Trump is despicable, an incompetent man-child with authoritarian ambitions, I fully see the risk of putting him back in power, but I need my political interests protected, so I’ll still vote for him because the benefits outweigh the costs”. That would be awful still, but at least more honorable and honest."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Let’s reverse everything. BIDEN refuses to accept that he needs to leave the White House; asks a mob to march to the Capitol (“… and I’ll be right there with you”); floats the idea of using the military against the enemy within, namely the right; etc. I’m sure conservatives would not say a single word about it. 😅"
gPKkIkEnZw8,this is just pure hypocrisy on the part of Ben Shapiro
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Sam: ""It seemed likely based on her poll results in the last weeks"" (referring to Hillary claiming russian collusion). Yeah, this didn't age so well... did you see the poll result this time? Most of them said it was _extremely_ likely that Kamala would win... Why does a smart guy like Sam get fooled by the media?"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben was wrong. Nobody denied that Trump won the election. Biden’s speech and Harris’s speech also underlined Peaceful transfer of Power.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Well Sam’s arguments aged well lol Trump 2024!
gPKkIkEnZw8,.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Nov 7th. Where are the liberal election deniers, Ben?"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Update after the election - Kamala lost pretty hard and conceded within the first couple hours. Ben is, as always, being disingenuous. Ben can never admit this because it would mean that the left and right are not equal on this, and that would hurt his viewers."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Lmao well Ben was wrong, conceded instantly."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ugh. I keep trying to give Sam a chance, but he's so broken that it's sad to see. This is what TDS does to a smart brain."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"I need a liberal atheist Jew lecturing me about how great Reagan’s principles were.

And two zionists lecturing me about American politics 

Thanks"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Sir, please share your thoughts on the Trump victory."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Watching this after the election is so brilliant
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben, Trump won the 2024 election. Now where’s the election denialism on the left similar in magnitude to the right’s in 2020?"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Trying to be neutral here, but Sam knocked this out of the park ⚾ 🏟️ 🥇"
gPKkIkEnZw8,It is November 6. Kamala conceded without a single drop of any of the “election denialism” the Ben promised would occur. Fucking fraud
gPKkIkEnZw8,Kamala is backed by Liz and Dick Cheney. Putin may want a non-establishment figure who doesn't want to perpetuate the war in Ukraine for the militay industrial complex. Why? Well if you ask Kamala it is  so he can invade all of Europe. Which is an absurd lie. Trump says he wants the war to end. What does Sam want.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Who else is sick of the false equivalency tick the right has as an argument?
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Hillary’s great at connecting  Russia to her opponents 
Oddly did it to Tulsi Guibard to keep a free thinking democrat from winning."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Project 2025 can finally be acted on
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben using weasel words and being entirely disingenuous. Nothing new.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Oh, Ben...this is so embarrassing. Wow."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Well Ben's prescience isn't holding up very well, is it?"
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Ben Shapiro is just a pig as Trump. When Kamala just accepted the nomination, he said ""she slept her way to the top"". A moron for certain things"
gPKkIkEnZw8,Great contribution from the person in the middle.
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben now that the election is over has the happened? SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben Shapiro is a PAB loud mouth
gPKkIkEnZw8,I’m a 65 year-old father of two.  If you were my son I’d be extremely proud of you.  Please keep up the excellent work!   😊
gPKkIkEnZw8,Boy am I laughing my nuts off.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"I used to love Sam Harris until he contracted TDS.  I don’t think I’ve heard him this emotional in any of his voluminous debates. 

Sam - you’ve also said that the ends justify the means with keeping Trump out of office. You said you didn’t care if there were any damning evidence on Hunter Biden’s laptop. Withholding that information likely impacted votes. You’re willing to betray democracy when you find it necessary."
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Democrats pretend to worry about Russian or any foreign election interference, but on the other hand want to remove voter ID  which would allow them to vote directly."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Sad that i used to like Ben. Another sell out to Trump
gPKkIkEnZw8,People still take Ben Shapiro seriously?
gPKkIkEnZw8,"Well the election happened, Trump won, and we see Kamala has accepted the results, and Ben is wrong."
gPKkIkEnZw8,Ben is lying about biden leaking documents. Ben doesn’t care about facts.
gPKkIkEnZw8,The guy who uses facts don't care about your feelings. Literally is ignoring the facts for his opinion.  Ben is definitely a republican cause his hypocrisy is on point.
gPKkIkEnZw8,"God Sam Harris is so out of touch...
He's the literal definition of an ivory-towered intellectual."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Great listening to Sam. When the other two morons were speaking it was such an insult to my intellect
R-FwEbGGCzU,I still don't understand why Sam gave his precious air to Ben.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Hey Ben, news flash, Mike Pompeo is not going to be part of the administration."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I am impressed by Sam Harris's misleading language. Trump has the atomic bomb buttons but Biden never had the responsibility . . .

Maniacs, stupid, extremists marginalizing people is not an argument, like the methods of regimes using propaganda for mass information."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Worst way to cut a video. You realise Sam spoke for about 80% of that clip and went all over the place from topic to topic. Filled with 
 vague and extreme assumptions too"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam maintained a rational mindset throughout all the chaos of the past eight years. I’m sure he is disappointed that Trump won, but you have to admit, he was completely right about Harris conceding without protest."
R-FwEbGGCzU,I want to like Ben...but I don't see how.  As an intellectual Jew I expected a lot more reason form him.
R-FwEbGGCzU,10:28 aged like milk
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Ben, criticism of the terrorist Israeli government is not antisemitism"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I can’t take Ben’s weasel voice so I’m not rewatching this “debate”. But wasn’t it Mike Pompeo that Ben was saying would be Trump’s sane cabinet pick for foreign policy? It’s a week after the election to destroy democracy and both Pompeo and Niki “the Birdbrain” Haley have been SMOTE!! Also,on a side note, Google searches for the definition of the word tariff spiked on Nov 6. 😐"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"SMART LATINOS FOR TRUMP MAGA FOREVER CARE ABOUT AMERICA FIRST AND DONT GIVE A RATS ASS ABOUT UKRAINE OR ANYONE ELSE, AMERICA FIRST!!!!   STOP WASTING OUR MONEY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND MAKING FEDERAL RESERVE PRINTING MONEY AT US CITEZEN EXPENSE WHILE THE INFLATION SKYROCKETS"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben Shapiro is intellectually dishonest
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben doesn’t miss bro he’s a sniper
R-FwEbGGCzU,Who would be better for the women and children in Gaza? Why not ask that question?
R-FwEbGGCzU,What about that they're BOTH telling the truth?
R-FwEbGGCzU,"To have empathy for the plight of Palestinians does not equate to antisemitism.  Nor does anti-zionist discourse mean you don't also support Israel's right to exist . Antisemitism is by definition  rightwing. Leftwing antisemitism is a myth, used to try to discredit criticism of the Israeli state and it's policies and actions. Criticism of Israel comes from a broad spectrum and often it is antisemitic yes. But non-Racism is a pillar of leftwing thought. It and antisemitism are diametrically opposed."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Gotta agree with Ben there Sam
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Ben makes some good points but there's a lot of false equivalence (like a Dem president has never refused ro concede an election loss) and some disingenuous stuff like not knowing whom Putin prefers. On the last part, I speak Russian and can tell you that watching the Russian state TV coverage of the US is exactly like watching Fox News or OANN. They LOVE Trump."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Under Donald Trump ukraine government was a puppet of Russia. So its funny to claim Trump helped ukraine. This 60 IQ man is not unpredictable, he is very predictable."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Instead of asking which would be better for Israel, Maybe we should be asking which candidate would be better to stop the genocide going on in Gaza and Lebanon."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam getting beat pretty badly in this debate. 

One example, he made the point that you just have to flatter him. Ben says that’s evident, rhetorically, but policy outcomes reflect an effective foreign policy. Then, Sam says the same thing but offers no evidence of the offer of flattery (or golf courses) has meant anything.  

Surrounded by grifters and maniacs? How about Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. Come on, Sam."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Cougars will like Bens face.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"look Sam, I'm with you on this but when your argument boils down to ""my candidate's hands are tied because a plurality of their supporters are either antisemitic or dumb enough to be ideologically in thrall to antisemites"", you're actually explaining - or excusing - a vote for Donald Trump as easily as anyone else."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Shapiro makes a lot of assumptions but his rapid-fire delivery enables him to pass over a lot of them. For example, assuming Trump 2.0 will be like Trump 1.0. No allowance for mental degeneration."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Ben forgets all of the chaos of Trump’s presidency, especially his disastrous handling of the biggest health crisis in a century…. You know… bleach in the veins; it’ll all be over in a week, giving hard needed tests to Putin over Americans… what about the Donbas region of Ukraine, the abandonment of the Kurds, the abandonment of the Afghani government and the surrender to the Taliban…"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Still deranged Sam. Disappointed. I thought you were a big picture guy. You’re missing the whole point entirely.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Shapiro is the epitome of an oxymoron
R-FwEbGGCzU,Lol @ ben Shapiro being a victim..
R-FwEbGGCzU,Dems arent anti semetic. They see zionism as the failed force ethnic state that it is. Israel is not a real place and they're committing genocide.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Must be nice to ignore dentity politics.  Its easy tho when your identity as a white male is rarely under attack even when it should be..
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben Shapiro just stsrted being Jewish oct 8 2023. Foh. Dude is a tool
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben trying to hard sell “unstable” 😂😂😂
R-FwEbGGCzU,Thanks Sam. I especially appreciate you breaking up your discussion in bite sized chunks; makes for easy consumption.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I am beginning to think that one day some future Renaissance scholar will discover that Dante’s Inferno includes a Tenth Circle of Hell that is filled to overflowing with pricks, assholes, and maggots who continue to believe in Trump, this obviously corrupt criminal, despite his own stupidity, his many failures, his criminality, his corruption, and his countless lies.
As Kamala Harris once noted: “Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States. Certainly not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had - himself.”"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam’s warnings about Trump and his circle feel like fear-mongering, especially when he paints Kamala and her team as the 'sane' option. The last 3.5 years have shown us the impact of policies that have been anything but favorable, especially for Jewish communities in both the U.S. and Israel. Sam’s view here just doesn’t align with the clarity he's brought over the past year.

That said, I genuinely appreciate the respectful exchange among Sam, Bari, and Ben. Thank you."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Ben won this debate. The reality is, our nation was better off during the Trump administration. It's quite simple. That's why he got my vote. 

I'll take Trump's peculiar personality over the thinly veiled evil that the Democratic party has become any day of the week."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Shes already threatened a cut off of ALL support for Israel within 30 days.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Did Ben rally day, literal, that trump is unpredictable because with him ukranians we're not dieing?"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Wow great discussion about what’s good for Israel shame that what’s good for America had to be cut for time
R-FwEbGGCzU,What an amazing moderator
R-FwEbGGCzU,Shapiro - have you forgotten what Trump did (or did not) do during COVID? It was a disaster! He is a threat to America and the world. Watching from Canada.
R-FwEbGGCzU,The problem of Kamila is the same - she knows there is no genocide - she actually have access for the information of IDF's efforts in preventing civilians casualties- yet she reports lies lie just to be fevorit  for this or that voter...
R-FwEbGGCzU,I used to like Ben.    : {
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben is a brilliant person.. Trump did a fine job as President.. Biden and Harris are an unmitigated disaster
R-FwEbGGCzU,These three are the third column in the US. Jews who should be Israeli citizens rather than American citizens.its because of these Israeli moles that the US foreign policy in the Middle East is in shambles.
R-FwEbGGCzU,That’s not good enough for Ben that we have given billions and billions and US soldiers have been involved.. Kamala must do more & never mention the unimaginable loss of civilian life -again we live in America stick to American citizens safety & prosperity.
R-FwEbGGCzU,What a dumb ass trump hates Iran it’s Obamas fault they have nukes Iran could not give him anything
R-FwEbGGCzU,"„He seems to have nothing but contempt for our allies and nothing but praise for our enemies“ What Sam Harris says here is what a lot of Americans seem to not be worried about, but it is a massive danger to their place in the world. Even the mighty USA can NOT keep all their adversaries in check, without allies. Great points from Harris here!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Who will be better in stopping the ongoing genocide you is not a question that pops in these two “very moral” guys
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I find it disappointing that Sam would so easily excuse Kamala's pandering to a political base that Sam himself thinks are idiots. He would never excuse Trump for doing that, but for Kamala the ends justify the means. 

To be clear, I'm not commenting on Sam or Ben's positions overall, I'm just saying on this point I think Sam's bias is clearly showing."
R-FwEbGGCzU,The reality is that Trump funded and armed the Saudis to commit genocide in Yemen.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Hey Ben Shapiro,
Will you be happy after Netanyahu lfinnally finishes genocide of Palestine? No more passes for the Holocaust you weazel"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"*_>""Timothy McVeigh style violence""_*

As distinct from the ""Cave of Patriarchs"" (1994) style, huh? 😏"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"In case there are those who are still confused about such a seemingly unpatriotic and, what some might even argue, seditionist discussion, read below:
*_""All we [Jewish-Americans] care about is being good Zionists, and being good citizens of Israel.  Because, even though I'm not Israeli born, Israel is my heart._*
 ~ Sheldon Adelson (2010) — the most prolific ""donor"" to both sides of U. S. politics (2016 [R], $150M; 2018 [R], $55M; 2024 [R], $100M)"
R-FwEbGGCzU,One of the most severe cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome I’ve ever seen
R-FwEbGGCzU,"right *JEW* v. left *JEW* moderated by another *JEW,* pushed by *JEW* algorithm...
absolute state of ""american"" political discourse"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Does anybody know what happens to Sam when he starts talking about Israel? 
Most of the time, he is very thoughtful, rational, and a proponent of peace and compassion. I generally like his speeches and debates. 
Here in this video, its all about 'regime change', anti-war people being morons, being right of the right-wing war-hawks, and IDF being so moral.
Where the fuck is his compassion, vipasna and meditation practice that he always talks about?

After watching this, I don't think I can take him seriously anymore."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Im worried about the US support for the terro ris t State of Israhell
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam and Ben are morally bankrupt to the extent of being evil
R-FwEbGGCzU,I wouldn’t post a debate I was destroyed in
R-FwEbGGCzU,9mins is enough of Sam Harris saying nothing real at all. Trump was the most stable president in our lifetime. The world is in chaos by comparison.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Palestinians have a right to defend themselves against Israeli occupation........U.S. is complicit in genocide in Gaza
R-FwEbGGCzU,Why should Americans care about israel that does nothing but leech of America
R-FwEbGGCzU,Does supporting Israel mean you support genocide?
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben should co-host a show with Meghan Kelly.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben shows his intellectual weaknesses when up against Sam Harris.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"He dosent have an issue with the right ""They will replace you"". We know Trump is anti semite and his supporters."
R-FwEbGGCzU,US people's interest in Israel is weird.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Trump did the Abraham accords..what did Kamala do..
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam Harris is simply wrong..Trump is better for Israel. How can an atheist decide what is better for Israel..
R-FwEbGGCzU,So tired of the disingenuous and dangerous argument that opposition to Israeli policies is equivalent to a hatred/fear of all Jewish people.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam Harris has Trump Derangement Syndrome. The antisemitism on the left, is so clearly linked to Jihadist sympathisers"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam Harris is the most unimpressive public intellectual out there today.
R-FwEbGGCzU,You think Ben dyes his eyebrows?
R-FwEbGGCzU,https://youtu.be/K8o6n-AVqMw?si=aOksAm4SA2v65CdV
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam Harris 🙏 we need more American values normal thinking people like you 
Unlike these Rabid Trump Cultist Weirdo Freaks. Seriously!!! 
Ben Shapiro is truly a Rabid Trump Cultist who lives in an alternative truth world.
Drifter Pundit for sure"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben Shapiro would be an incredible debater if he was actually correct about things. He really handicaps himself by being wrong
R-FwEbGGCzU,"A better question is, would Kamala or Trump be better for AMERICA?  Israel is a liability."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam is usually such a great speaker, but I couldn't understand him at all in this clip. I think there might he something of the IDF's in his mouth?"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Israel is fighting existential war, you say. Jesus Christ, man, they came in with AKs and trucks an year ago, which is laughable for any modern army to defend, no breach since. Ukraine fights an existential war – Israel could have done absolutely nothing, but to negotiate/prison exchange to get the hostages back, and everything would have been fine."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Move to israel FFS
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Wow, not enough Palestinians have been killed by the IDF, says Sam. 1 to 1 death ratio? Which world does this buffoon live in?"
R-FwEbGGCzU,What more a⁵⁵ kissing can Democrats do for Israel? We giving them Billions of our money & weapons. The privilege is outrageous!!!!
R-FwEbGGCzU,"The more I listen to the brilliant Sam Harris talk about Trump, the more I’m convinced Trump slept with his wife, infecting him with severe TDS. OBVIOUSLY Trump is better for Israel than weak Kamala. October 7th likely doesn’t happen with Trump in office. That Sam can’t concede this simple fact speaks to the severity of TDS 🤦‍♂️"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Trump is NOT a republican. Bernie is not a democrat. They are independents.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Love how you guys are just learning that Israel controls America,"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"RFK should have been president..
but supporting Trump is the biggest mistake ever. yes the democrats have corrupt people supporting them. but part of their lying is that they are holding to a few secrets and inner wars they can't freely speak about since that deep state wants to crash everything. With Trump it will be too aggressive, they are trying to fight the deep state from within in a subtle war right now. Trump is also allowing my corrupt gov' Netanyahu to inflame the entire middle east, risking ww3. and the fact Netanyahu knowingly skipped a hostage deal of -civilians! in favor of strategic manouvers tells you who Trump shakes hands with. Netanyahu intends to occupy gaza, creating a needless long war killing hundreds more of our troops in the future and thousands of their mix of civilians and terror troops. And Trump allows it. Something tells me he might give Putin a similar free hand to massacre ukranian civilians and defeated troops (he'll just give him some of crimea but the fate of the ukranians?), and only when its too late will Trump realize the mistake, fight back and whops, another door to ww3."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Wow, it's crazy how the left almost always have a very difficult time expressing themselves and their beliefs through their speech.
It's so crazy how they almost always speak in word salads, they sputter, stutter, or say um a lot. 
They seem to always struggle and be somewhat confused when they speak....
Where as the Republicans speak clearly, speak straight to the point, the words seem to just roll off their tongues with little effort.  They speak with greater conviction.
I see it in ever6 debate."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Trump pressured Ukraine to produce material Rudy Juliani could use in the 2020 election by withholding weapons that proved crucial to defending Ukraine during Russia's renewed invasion. That's a high crime and he was impeached for it.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Trump is better for America the world and Isreal. What principles do the democrats actually have, anything but trump syndrome, child abuse and as much war as possible!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Did Sam Harris have a frontal lobotomy? Never in all my born days have I heard so much nonsense from a person I have been told is a public intellectual.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"The whole argument of ""this war wouldn't have happened if Trump was president"" is called a non-causal event. It is impossible to test because you would require a time machine. It's all conjecture and has 0 foundation in reality."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"More importantly, (at least if you’re the “nationalist” you claim to be) who is better for the United States"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Does Sam even know that Kamala cannot speak without a teleprompter? That she cannot speak about her plans or express her true self without pre-written words? Only unique and people of character can speak without assistance. Her accents keep on changing to win over black people one day and Hispanics another day. Basically she is a created product instead of a genuine person with her own ideas and beliefs. How someone like Sam does not see that as a major problem really discredits him in my eyes and most likely other peoples as well. Originality of character is one of the most important things a president should have.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Curious what a self-defense genocide is?
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam, usually you sound so coherent. In this topic, you sound like you are completely taken by emotions and your willingness to explain Kamala's flaws and bash Trumps character is incoherent."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Israel own America it will make zero difference
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam wouldn’t call liberals who are appalled by the devastation in Gaza morons if he saw Palestinians as humans.. 

I guess his spiritual path helps him feel “connected to the universe”, but not to certain humans.."
R-FwEbGGCzU,A strong leader Kamala would explain to the far left morons why they are mistaken. A leader would lead them not follow them.
R-FwEbGGCzU,^the permitted political spectrum: zionism only
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam Harris is saying that Trump is very practical...
R-FwEbGGCzU,Two Zionist Jews talking about which president would be better for a country they don't live instead of who would be better for AMERICA. Lol these two don't give a damn about the US
R-FwEbGGCzU,I’m not a Harris fan but Sam is right Donald Trump is not an honest person and it’s a terrible look for America
R-FwEbGGCzU,Both candidates are lousy. This is how far we’ve come?
R-FwEbGGCzU,Most people in Israel wants this war to stop what does most Israel want ? They are tired of losing their loved ones . It sounds like Israel is upset with their leader. Ask what the most of the Israel people wants
R-FwEbGGCzU,Vote blue all the way to save our democracy and our freedom💙💙💙💙💙
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam is broken… he sounds dangerous to himself and others…
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I wonder how much of your own humanity you have to lose, to be able to show support for a candidate like Trump."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Love watching Ben Shapiro. Don't agree with much of what he says. Love you brother. 
One take though: the then President Trump said there were fine people on both sides in regards to the Antisemitic march in Virginia during his time in office. If that's not alarming about Trump and GOP... I wonder what is. 
Also, in all the talk about Trump's administration, I don't hear any mention of Pence, I mean I never hear Ben say ""Trump-Pence administration"" but in reference to things he finds wrong with the Biden administration, he makes sure to say ""Biden-Harris"" in some cases even ""Harris-Biden"". That's just wrong, the powers of the presidency so much outweigh that of the VP. This guy, Sam, is trying to knock them to the reality of Trump but they're just too far gone. I think the hate for the other side makes them feel there are no merits to them. 
""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT"" is what you stand for?
Come on Ben. Come on!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"At least we have an honest discussion, who will be represent AIPAC on the international stage and best let them dictate American foreign policy"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Blows my mind that Ben Shapiro is taken seriously as a religious person, utterly unbelievable!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Not normally a Shapiro fan but I thought he made much stronger arguments in this case.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ben paid by Russian confirmed…he is such a sniveling coward
R-FwEbGGCzU,if these people are so concerned with Israel maybe they should move there
R-FwEbGGCzU,Is Ben equating support for Palestine as antiSemitism?
R-FwEbGGCzU,Why should Israel even be a consideration ? Who is America for exactly ?
R-FwEbGGCzU,What even is Israel without Americans?
R-FwEbGGCzU,The Democrats eagerness to combat disinformation by using censorship is too anti-democratic for my liking. Trump has no interest in limiting free speech
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Jews hater is didn’t start from 7/10, very long time ago, Muslim just Cary on the Jews hater."
R-FwEbGGCzU,I don’t thing that Kamala or trump will be good for Israel.
R-FwEbGGCzU,I don’t thing that Kamala or trump will be good for Israel.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"For me, as a foreigner, it sounds absolutely preposterous, it sounds weird,  that people ask which President woud be better for Israel, instead of asking which of them would be better for the American people.

Not better for Israel, or Latinos, or Blacks, or Asians, or American Muslims, but for THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

That kind of debate really baffles me. It seems to show that something is not OK, something is out of kilter. Could anyone here tell me of a single instance when two Israeli journslists met to discuss which decisions Israel had to make  would be  better for the United States?"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I really dislike that Sam Harris almost always interrupts Ben Shapiro.  That an indication either he's not listing to the discussion and just wants to keep bashing Trumps character, or he intentionally knows Ben has a valid point to and answer and doesn't' want the public to hear the answer."
R-FwEbGGCzU,I love what sam bringg to the table but what i dont respect is that he didn't admit that he was wrong about what he said about trump in 2016. At least say i was wrong.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Good conversation!
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam is asked if Trumps policy was beneficial, Sam responses he does not find it useful to look back. WOW very clever way to not answer a question which obviously puts Trump in a good light and the Dems is a bad light, perfect woke debating, dishonesty."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Ben simply can't contend with the avalanche of fact and reason wielded by Sam. It is clear Ben's forfeited moral principles for political allegiance, a symptom endemic to the current republican party."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Come on, ben, you're a smart guy. You know full well that trump a disaster."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Free palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
R-FwEbGGCzU,Why are they ignoring that Israel is racist against Palestine and actively trying to extinct them?
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam Harris should stay out of politics
R-FwEbGGCzU,"The woke college students support Hamas, they have attacked Israeli supporters man are crazy!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,White Supremists are not right that is woke theology. they are wacked.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Just to know,  70 % of the GA£a war bill was covered by USA , and still Ben Shapiro is not happy. Wow"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam Harris has do throughly  gaslit himself about Trump, he’s become impervious to debate"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Trump lost Afghanistan by freeing all prisoners of war who went to join the Taliban army
R-FwEbGGCzU,My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤❤Trump 2024❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻 My Hero president Trump ❤❤❤
R-FwEbGGCzU,Two American citizens arguing over which American presidential candidate will be best for Israel and not America? How strange.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"If you want to know what ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" is - just listen to Sam. LOL Sam has this constant look on his face like he has constipation, whenever talking about Trump, it's really funny to watch."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Has Sam Harris been sick? Has he got TDS too?
R-FwEbGGCzU,The only thing that connects Sam and Ben is both of them are not sympathetic towards Palestinians.
R-FwEbGGCzU,It’s weird that we throw around the word antisemitism in an attempt to shape the discussion when it’s simply a distaste for evil.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam Harris would get us into a war.  Just like the rest of them do.  Trump looks at the situation very practically with street smarts and common sense.  Trump ends up being right about a lot of stuff.

Harris associates Donald Trump's ugliest side to his ability to work.  As Peterson says, you shouldn't attribute conspiracy to what you can identify as incompetence.  Harris sees Trump as incompetent, yet Trump is far from incompetent.  So Harris, must by default believe there is a deeper conspiracy into why Trump is able to operate and succeed as a politician.  This is also known as...Trump Derangement Syndrome."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Israel sucks
R-FwEbGGCzU,no sane person cares about this. most important is who would be better for america
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sorry brother Harris is a branch of the evil Obama tree who tried his best to destroy Israel 

Trump is the most friendly president for Israel ever

This Jew votes for trump"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"In 1400 BC, The Jewish people & their culture lived in Egypt and throughout those lands. In 570 AD, Muhammad and the Muslim religion were born. But before the Persian invasion, Israel's territory and the surrounding lands belonged to the Jews hundreds of years before the Arabian culture conquered it. Lost it to Britain, then Britain gave it ""back"" to the Jewish people, even though Palestinians occupied it. A little history for all the ""illegitimacy illiterates."""
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam and Ben are definitely not same level, ben is many levels higher"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sane people....really? That's hilarious! The entire reason why Hamas attacked Israel, Russia invaded Ukraine & China imposed a Security Sweep Law in Hong Kong, incarcerating the leftover independents, was ""because"" of the weakly pathetic leadership in office from a superpower country like America. Kamala, as president, is like ""begging countries who've been dying to invade & overthrow their bordering countries to do so."" That's insane, just like Kamala allowed Cartel to set up shops all over America because she didn't feel like dealing with the border crises."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"In USA, on 9/11 - 2,977 people were killed in a country of 285 million people. On October 7th, 1,200 people were killed in a country of 9 million people. That's the equivalence of 36,000 Americans being killed & thousands being taken hostage and then killed. How do you think the USA would react to that?"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Moses, along with thousands of Jews lived in Egypt in 1400 BC, While Muhammad who created Allah was born in 570 AD. The Jewish culture has been from that land since way before the Persian invasion."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam, your ""opinions"" are duly noted. However, what everyone hears is personal opinions. NOONE CARES! Sorry. But our economy is more important than your feelings."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"The ""There were no invasions of Ukraine under Trump"" argument is weak to me.  I am surprised no one has argued against in the following way:

Under democratic presidents, Putin felt the need to take action due to the US's support of Ukraine.  Russia invaded Ukraine as a measure to stop Western influence from gaining ground in the country.  Under Trump, that support waned, and Putin again saw the need to take kinetic action.  Putin didn't invade Ukraine because Trump scared him with unpredictability, but because Russia did not fear Trump and the US when it came to the Ukraine due to Trump's lack of support for Ukraine.  

And even if it was true that Trump scared Putin into not invading- his current policy is to not continue support for Ukraine, but to instead force them to deal with Russia.  Republicans are actively trying to undermine Ukraine.  So why are Republicans trying to act like Trump would have better foreign policy when it comes to Ukraine?"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Trump is a weirdo and most in the whole world thinks so. He is not fit.
R-FwEbGGCzU,“Trumpism” is a vague term.
R-FwEbGGCzU,3 very evil people
R-FwEbGGCzU,If RFK junior and Ben Shapiro made a baby at least it would sound normal😊🇸🇩🍉
R-FwEbGGCzU,"The TDS is strong in Harris.  ""If the Mullahs in Tehran offered him a golf course...""  Dude, he already has many golf courses.  He's willing to lose them to restore sanity to government - ours and then around the world."
R-FwEbGGCzU,The deluding word salad from Ben is mind blowing! Just tons of words real fast to try to cover up lies and utter stupidity. Very American actually!
R-FwEbGGCzU,"2 Jews, moderated by an Israeli spy, conrversing on which candidate is best for their Jewish country.
Fascinating."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"We all know Trump will be the best for peace.  You mess with Us, then you mess with the full power of the United States under Trump, vs, the left talk talk, that never end up nothing but a cash cow money laundering for the democrats.   Trump 24"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sams outlook is skewed.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I agreed with almost everything Sam said in the debate aside from the first point he made in this clip. In fact, I’m pretty sure Sam Harris doesn’t even agree with his own point here. If we include jihadi anti-semitism in the left-wing antisemitism bucket, left-wing antisemitism is clearly the bigger threat. Given the fact that many on the left are currently protesting for Hamas, I don’t think this is an unfair grouping to make. Anyone who listens to Sam regularly knows that he has come into contact with many left-wing Jihadi sympathizers, so it’s strange that he is pretty much ignoring that point in this debate. Probably because it is inconvenient for his argument.."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Ben, Trump doesn’t have a strategy. Anything “good” that happened in Foreign policy was due to staff around him, and good luck. Harris is far more conservative, and potentially more powerful, than Trump on foreign policy. NATO fears Trump. They want Harris, to maintain stability"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Talk about so-called 'identity politics' - Shapiro has made his whole career on it 😂
R-FwEbGGCzU,Pseudo intellectual Sam Harris at his genocide speech
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I am a Jew.  Trump thinks Hitler is a “good man”. Con Man Trump is a criminal. Don’t believe he’s a friend to a Jew. YouTube Michael Cohen, he knows him best.  U.S. General’s that worked under Trump under his last administration came out to warn America that he’s a fascist. Google it."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"You are 💯 correct Sam , Kamala hit trump hard when she said at the debate that world leaders are laughing at you and would eat trump for lunch"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"2:44 = ""...if mullah in Tehran offer him a golf course deal somewhere, our policy could change...""
Me = Bro never herd of the Israel Lobby!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Candace Owens secretary of state would be hilarious.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Very nice debate, respect to all"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam Harris is one of those far left liberal jews
R-FwEbGGCzU,"The survival of israhell????
Dragging America into global war and thinking about survival of israhell ?"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"To say that more on the left are against Israel is totally wrong. Ben conveniently forgets to specify that those on the left who are against Israel are so ON ISRAEL'S GENOCIDAL ACTIONS. Otherwise, nobody is against Israel's existence.

Bery said that Trump looks crazy and Kamala weak on foreign policy, which is absolutely stupid. Just because kamala is a woman makes her weak?!!!!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,More worried about who’s good for America personally. Maybe I’m just crazy.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam, where are you getting this data on your 'defensive war?'"
R-FwEbGGCzU,The fact that Sam presents himself as a coherent person is what’s most puzzling
R-FwEbGGCzU,1 to 1 in Gaza is horseshit
R-FwEbGGCzU,Love how Shapiro completely ignores a million Americans dying from Covid and having their economy wrecked because of the Donald's administrations moronic incompetence. This is the same administration that closed the Obama pandemic preparedness department of the government. Idiots.
R-FwEbGGCzU,Have you or have you not seen the atrocities that Israel are currently commiting? WTF guys I used to think you were smart
R-FwEbGGCzU,The fact that warmongers want Trump to win is indication enough that he shouldn’t.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Lol so these ""americans"" will pick the president who is true to Israel 🤣"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Ben, supporting people not being slaughtered is not antisemitism.  Just stop."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"This is a joke right?

I think it’s very telling how we have commercials about supporting Israel from candidates along with debates like this surrounding Israel. I think that says an awful lot about the corruption we have infested through the banking system, along with many other sectors. You’ll never see a commercial about “kamila supports New Zealand, trump supports Britain” it’s always isreal. I wonder why.  I love how nobody goes back to how isreal was formed. How they are relatively new, and have all the tech and power of a nation three times their size. Wonder why. Must just be smarter than everyone else.. you guys are wolves in sheep clothing. Even though I like Ben unfortunately.. he’s off on a couple things.. like 2. The other 1000, he’s golden."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"1 to 1 combatants to civilians, Jesus wept what bull"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam Harris's argument at the end falls flat and makes a lot of assumptions about Kamala Harris' intentions and true allegiances. Her words have been consistently mixed on Israel. Often severely castigating them in their fight against utter demonic evil. There are no excuses for that. Expedience is not an excuse bec the far left will vote for her anyway over Trump. The far left are also not one issue voters. They care about climate, women's issues, minimum wage and more. She has no excuse for equivocating repeatedly on Israel in their moment/year of horror. None. Other than cowardice and moral turpitude. I usually have deep respect for him but his arguments are thin on this issue."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Wow, Ben is worried about anti Semitism but does not give a shit about the many other ethic groups in the US that the Republicans have insulted and threatened in the most racist and disgusting manner !"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Afghanistan??? TRUMP brokered that stupid deal!
R-FwEbGGCzU,Sam Harris is a brilliant man.  Shapiro needs to defend the indefensible but that's his choice.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"If you need a narcissistic moron like Trump to defend liberty, free speech, the west, democracy, enlightenment and Israel you and all those things are lost!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,Kameltoe is good for nobody but the elites
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Sam, as usual, nails it!"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"WHO CARES? Is this the election for president of the US, or the president of Israel?
This is why people accuse you of having dual loyalty. You do."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"I am so bitterly disappointed in your statements about Israel and how they conduct their war on the Palestinians. Yes I get some of my information from social media, but the genocide that is happening has been declared as such not only by the UN, scholars, politicians worldwide, not to mention the many millions of people taking to the streets. How deflating to hear you talk so nonchalantly about what is happening in Gaza and in the Westbank. Deleting your app, you still have a lot of an awakening to do."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"You both make me sick on this topic.  How can you just hand-wave away people's concerns about children who are being intentionally starved and bombed into Oblivion and sniped in the head by the IDF. I'm not even on tiktok and I understand it's a genocide. So belittling, it's gross."
R-FwEbGGCzU,"There is a genocide, IDF are doing ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, over 15,000 children dead is sick,hospital schools university’s bombed destroyed, this genocide needs to stop now, forget your hatred of Muslims, this is facist behaviour of Nazis in world war 2, nobody is confused the world wants a ceasefire release hostages on both sides, for the IDf to leave Gaza and West Bank and Lebanon now… bib and trump are the same dictator’s and only care about themselves no matter what the cost in the long term, Israel are committing war crimes and will face justice, God bless the women and children the people who suffer the most will eventually come on top… sick beyond words"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, is like equating the opposition to the Third Reich to being anti-Aryan.  It's absurd."
R-FwEbGGCzU,Ahhhhhhh a lecture about the fear of bigotry by two bigots.
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Shapiro is wrong. Things weren't better with trump. 
Unemployment skyrocketed to over 14%. A trillion dollars was added to the national debt. Just for 2 examples"
R-FwEbGGCzU,"Dang, Sam’s an idiot now. It’s astonishing."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Heated Debate w/ Gavin Mcinnes Derails Into Violent Threats
►https://youtu.be/M96L2fPxJVY"
JiIY3MHN7YI,I don’t mind these types of conversations. I don’t view them as debates but rather as conversations that explore different perspectives. Both sides should listen attentively and express their opinions. I wish the government operated in a similar manner; Americans would be better off.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"They did touch on the big elephant in the room at one point. If you distribute the wealth just a tad more, more people will potensially get more time to get their head above water and be able to create businesses that are probably more relevant for society than the billionair investing it in a spaceship bringing two people to mars."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Entrepreneurs don't take all the risk...employees take the real risk. Especially when losing your job puts you closer to being homeless and not merely a bankruptcy filing.  This is just typical business bootlicking bullshit by this so called ""wealth expert""."
JiIY3MHN7YI,This was very informative and easy to listen too.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"1:09:40 ""What you're seeing right neow"""
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Love your content and especially these types of macroeconomic policy discussions with wealth managers, more of this please!"
JiIY3MHN7YI,I'll take any tax deduction I can get bro.  Speak for yourself we don't all have alot of money
JiIY3MHN7YI,"""Their wives and their wive's lovers are all voting for me.""  -Trump laughing at Destiny. BRUTAL"
JiIY3MHN7YI,Listen to Destiny throw it down while listening to Helldivers music in the background.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"LOL @ destiny dismissing everyone else's ""perception"" of inflation and reinstating his own. Yes, keep pretending that inflation isn't _""that big of a deal""_ and see what happens to you in 2028."
JiIY3MHN7YI,your body my choice
JiIY3MHN7YI,"These guys are not thinking just pushing ideological view.

Destiny gives them facts about how Obama had to fix the economy after Bush and faced a financial crisis that he got us through....he forgot to mention that he also got us through Ebola......Then Trump blew it up....and screwed up a medical crisis unlike Obama.....then Biden got ys through that....

But they start talking about how many years a Democrat was in office and ignore the facts."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"It is is interesting that the one  guy in the middle keeps mispronouncing Harris' name......shows an ideology.

Destiny is logical and practical and understands why he can do what he does......the grunt doing everything else."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Weird nobody challenge the other side's policies....Wait. Nothing was ever done. lol
JiIY3MHN7YI,"This guy has an ideological view to let the rich keep getting richer.

He does not understand that this is causing the strife between those having the riches, (which keep expanding), and the worker (who keeps being stagnant and not getting ahead).

The encome gap between those who are rich and those who are poor keeps expanding, and the care of the rich for them keeps being less and less.

The money given to businesses during the economic crisis was not invested on people and passed through as investment but put into stock.......different than what they promised."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Taxes is only for the poor.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"He said corporations aren’t people. Legally, that’s incorrect."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Just put the fries in the bag bro
JiIY3MHN7YI,Thomas Massie is dope and I'm a demonrat
JiIY3MHN7YI,Thought you were leaving fairy boy
JiIY3MHN7YI,"this was a great debate, but tom was pissing me off. like let caleb speak stop cutting him off."
JiIY3MHN7YI,So should January 6th not be taken as a huge deal? I thought I was incredibly awful for our country
JiIY3MHN7YI,please tell me at some point he explains to this goober that if you reinvest what could have been profits they dont need to count as profits anymore so everything he was saying about the taxes needing to be lower to encourace reinvesting
JiIY3MHN7YI,Destiny's slowly morphing into Peter Dinklage.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"…okay sorry to interject  but at the beginning the guy debating Destiny said he read a report saying 80% of gdp  comes from consumption not production. 😅

This is fundamentally incorrect. Like categorically. If you described GDP on an Econ test like this you’d get an f.

GDP stands for gross domestic ‘product’. It’s all production in real terms."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"destiny is suuuuch an idiot, good god."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"First off, what a great discussion. Second, bro had to go to a 70y/o to get a conservative with principled beliefs"
JiIY3MHN7YI,The most enjoyable/informative debate I have seen this year.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"When you say you like reducing the corporate tax rate from 38% to 21%, that only applies to the top most, simultaneously we raised the lowest bracket from 15% to 21%..."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Good talk
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Capital gains and capital gains taxation has completely destroyed the Australian housing market along with the unprecedented amount of legal migration. My city in the past year has experienced a 16.9% increase in the housing market within the past year.

Australia is probably the most centralised country in the world so the ""move somewhere more affordable"" argument doesnt really work here either."
JiIY3MHN7YI,All Trumpsters were so concerned about transgender and abortion and never discussed tariffs and healthcare. Guaranteed the idiots will be crying when more money will come out of their pockets. 🙄
JiIY3MHN7YI,"This guy, Destiny, speaks like Ben Shapiro. The only issue, that I see, is Ben spits facts and Destiny swallows misinformation."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"I absolutely didn't understand everything said here, but the disagreements were civil and in good faith which i haven't seen in awhile."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"These debates are so much better, very informative."
JiIY3MHN7YI,i feel like these guys will defend trump no matter what since he will cut thier taxes ngl
JiIY3MHN7YI,Destiny was in EXCELLENT form. He's really been studying and listening and thinking hard.
JiIY3MHN7YI,12:20 These corps made record breaking profits during covid and every year after and they in fact did not invest in the economy or infrastructure. We saw more salaries and stock buy backs then ever before and citidel kinda said we’d fight you if you wanted a part of it
JiIY3MHN7YI,10 times more money was given in quantitative easing to Wall Street than was given in stimulus. Plus how can you talk about economics without talking about the corporations who saw the profit levels go from 18% to 58%. It was price gouging several corporations including eggs and milk have already been sued for it
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Those fkn pre-WW2 manufacturing jobs are NEVER coming back. It will never make economic sense. It doesn’t mean they will always come from China, but these products will not be manufactured here."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"This was a good debate, I'm glad to see destiny speak speak with someone who isn't insane."
JiIY3MHN7YI,This was a great discussion. No emotional fighting egos just trying to have a practical discussion.
JiIY3MHN7YI,You pay VAT on domestic goods as well so he is talking crap
JiIY3MHN7YI,Corporations always always just buy their own stock back when you give them tax cuts -  the idea that they will invest in growing their business is utter bullshit .  In fact their fiduciary duty is to reward their share holders by buying their stick back .  This guy is no financial advisor
JiIY3MHN7YI,"So the guy agrees with every point Destiny makes praises parts of Harrises tax plan and doesn’t like Trumps yet he votes for Trump , lol is this not the definition of brainwashing 

The rich don’t create the jobs - the middle class small businesses have. Always created the vast majority of jobs in this country .   Rich people make money off investments that why they don’t want high capital gains taxes"
JiIY3MHN7YI,"So the guy agrees with every point Destiny makes praises parts of Harrises tax plan and doesn’t like Trumps yet he votes for Trump , lol is this not the definition of brainwashing"
JiIY3MHN7YI,Great conversation until 1h30 when the TDS finally kicked in... Poor tiny is brain rotted
JiIY3MHN7YI,This is one of the best discussions/debates I've seen in a LOOOOOOONG time. Intelligence level +100
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Destiny is the epitome of the phrase “An ocean of words, but only puddles of knowledge”. Dude thinks wikipedia makes him an expert to debate any issue."
JiIY3MHN7YI,This Tom guy sounds to me like he’s selling the new “TRICKLE DOWN” economics argument. From the Regan era. That was harmful to most Americans.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"God damn, Destiny like a Sayan over here, learning as he fights."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Why vote someone in your party out if they're higher seniority?  WTF, the vote is the people keeping their representatives in check... if they're dicking around instead of trying to work with the rest of government, then get their asses out and put someone in with some ethics.  Mitch is a spineless partisan, he's exactly what's wrong with people that have been their too long."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"That was really interesting and I hope he enjoyed it because even if I think we need to raise taxes on very wealthy people to fund services, it was nice hearing what he had to say."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"You lost me at 2:09, Kamala smarter than Trump?  lol 😅"
JiIY3MHN7YI,Very constructive
JiIY3MHN7YI,Is it normal for your jaw to be moving like that?🤔
JiIY3MHN7YI,"42:00 is a HUGE missed opportunity to point out that the GOVERNMENT ITSELF can invest money into research, innovation, construction, and alternative energy. You don't even have to concede that the money taken from taxes would go to ""consumption"", that's such a superficial way of looking at the governmental budget."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Worddddd saladdd.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"At 14:00 Already destiny is taking a L.

High taxes don't stimulate investment, deductions would.


And this assumes that the duductions are even useful. I'm not going to put all my money back into he business unless I'm a psychopath with a myopic vision of taking over the corporate world. I want a life

Me deducting my business vacation isn't really producing anything even though business expenditures go up."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Of course he thinks tax on investing is a bad idea because most of the money is coming from investing   cuz I can tell you right now he's not gaining most of his wealth off of working he's gaining an offer investments
JiIY3MHN7YI,This guy's really arguing for trickle down economics
JiIY3MHN7YI,This the irony about the supreme Court right they saying that Biden couldn't  forgive student loans but then after the fact they say that the president has immunity and presumptive immunity for any action he takes  we should have gave Biden the ability to give to the loan forgiveness
JiIY3MHN7YI,"@destiny  If there is any time to switch back to nation manufacturing, inflation is the time to do it, when you can undercut the prices that have increased for imports, due to supply and demand.  Moving manufacturing back is the right move, but it would have been a lot harder during Trump's first term, because it would require passing on the cost.  Democrats totally could have taken the initiative away from the GOP, but instead pushed out IRA that was a subsidies act for industry friends, that Nancy Pelosi got inside trade with.  Now, the cost of imports without tariffs are through the roof in a lot of areas, the same arguments back then, cannot be applied to today.  The problem with economist is that they do not care about local economic circulation, because global exploitation is where the money is for those that are financially able."
JiIY3MHN7YI,I got a good idea for how to go making raise revenue how about you get rid of the law that says that the federal government it's not allowed to make a profit
JiIY3MHN7YI,Decent guy there
JiIY3MHN7YI,"@1:02:00 On VAT and raising to meet Frances tariff: This becomes a game theory problem wherein tit-for-tat is the appropriate strategy if you want to win the game. That tit-for-tat engagement becomes a trade war and that means an enduring restrictive trade environment with constant supply interruptions. The guy's literally complaining that US companies importing goods from France are paying too little without the tariff. What's the logic here? Given that most of it is passed to the consumer, at whatever level, he's saying the problem is that it's too cheap to import and instead of passing those savings on to the US consumer the Government should capture it. Even if it only makes us level. Fine, make it a VAT or better yet call it what it is; a sales tax. Maybe then France wouldn't be provoked to respond."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Destiny thought he was doing right by ditching the orbiters for actual experts, but now the experts are shattering his reality xd"
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Destiny,  STFU, let your guest speak"
JiIY3MHN7YI,Cut government funded jobs. Quit sending money to other countries. Become an exporter of goods.
JiIY3MHN7YI,Who is watching after CHRISTIAN PRINCE smocked him alive ? 😂😂😂😂😂
JiIY3MHN7YI,+
JiIY3MHN7YI,How much of the tax-cut money was spent on stock buy-backs?
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Good lord, please speak slower. I’m trying to learn and you seem knowledgeable but it’s very hard to follow you when it sounds like you’re on a fast forward setting."
JiIY3MHN7YI,I do enjoy a civil debate and people who come respectful
JiIY3MHN7YI,"France has a EXTREMELY protected marketed so I wouldn’t doubt the VAT being exactly how he states, their cost of living is also extremely high, and they are a good case study for economics, like looking at when they introduced the 70% supertax on the rich and the like"
JiIY3MHN7YI,"I wish you'd get into politics, like in an actual position of power. I feel your potential and knowledge are wasted by just talking about these things on YT. I realize that your bringing the knowledge to light is still powerful in its own way by informing us people--but who in power is seeing these videos and making changes based on the information? Just my humble opinion."
JiIY3MHN7YI,This only proves Destiny runs on assumptions.
JiIY3MHN7YI,Destiny argues based on feelings.
JiIY3MHN7YI,This conversation is really about which do we want to fine tune more: corporate efficacy in generating more revenue or making lower and middle class people’s lives financially better.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Destiny claim is disproven rather easily regarding profits for a business.  He acts like any company that makes a profit, is more likely going to take those profits out of the business.  Why would they do that.  Anyone who is building the value of their company isn't taking it out as cash to sit in their bank.  Once you're not a brokie, there is literally no advantage to have massive amounts of cash in the bank, it's a disadvantage.  You always want you cash being invested, sitting in a bank it loses value day after day.  You keep it in investments, in your company."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"As with most anything I click on with Destiny, 10 minutes in, he's out of his depth."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Revisit last action hero!
JiIY3MHN7YI,"I think the difference the main difference between republicans and democrats is summed up in Destiny’s first statement. He says that republicans have a delusional view of how money works, drawing the line that all the voters for Trump, which is the majority of the nation, are delusional when it comes to money. There’s not much respect for each other that can be had with this type of thinking and rhetoric."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"My Boy Trump WON.
Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA  HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"For relaxed convos like this, don’t interrupt"
JiIY3MHN7YI,Actually enjoyable to watch
JiIY3MHN7YI,Now these are the debates i want. Not screaming matches where i don't know what the actual fuck is being said lol
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Destiny is right when it comes to Macro and Imo it is kind of whatever if you have solid tax deductions IF you also intend to cause massive systemic shocks by implementing huge tarrifs across the board. It ain't just companies importing that are affected, literally everyone is that's the sad part about it. 

However Destiny's take on finance and microeconomics are the first time where I'm VERY opposed to what he's saying and he's really showing his lack of knowledge in the topic. Like the part where he references the NPV valuation model then completely fumbles the basic notion of why present values coincide with us wanting our money now rather than at a later date. Or where he even fumbles something as easy as the corporate tax referencing it like it isn't a flat tax."
JiIY3MHN7YI,COPE
JiIY3MHN7YI,I havent viewed the channel in a while and damn. the destiny glow-up is insane. Looking good boss <3
JiIY3MHN7YI,US dollar being at a 25 year high against the Euro is entirely False. Currently the US dollar is worth like 10% less then the Euro.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Holy fuck destiny would you STFU. Seriously. Your overly fast talkin BS is so fkn annoying. You notice how the economist can say the same amount of meaningful speach without saying the amount of words you do???? The amount of words per second doesnt make you smarter, it makes you less concise. FFS im so fucking annoed by this. Just STFU and make your point concisely and stop taking so much adderall/cocaine. Such a fuckin bum honestly."
JiIY3MHN7YI,We have a scorned band nerd possibly on the spectrum who has no legitimate education or qualifications to speak on this subject debating an expert lmfao this is laughable
JiIY3MHN7YI,Excellent convo. I don’t understand how the VAT in Europe puts the US at a disadvantage however as domestic goods also pay the same tax rate. Does anyone have an explanation for this?
JiIY3MHN7YI,trump 2024.
JiIY3MHN7YI,Your side lost.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"TRUMP WON! AMERICA WON!
Your wife’s bf voted Trump"
JiIY3MHN7YI,"It's very clear Destiny doesn't know anything about economics, but it was nice for them to keep educating him."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Debates... used very loosely.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"13:37 Destiny is ofcourse correct. When a corportate tax rates are cut. Companies tend to lead heavily towards share buybacks and dividends.The thing that increases more supply is demand. You sell as many as you can sell but then eventually it costs more to make then the profit of getting that next sale. So when you get more money off of that it would be stupid to try to sell more than you're allocated budget towards sales. Unless you get A massive influx of cash. But even then you're probably investing in R&D. It usualy goes. Buybacks and Dividends, investment in expansion or R&D. Streamline operations, then consumer price reduction."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Let's see if i can get my head around this. Other countries should manufacture our comman goods. Sell it to us cheap. so we can make more advanced stuff. The advanced stuff is then going to be sold to ourselves and advanced nations. We are not selling it to those nations that make cheap stuff. Because they can't afford it. But when we sell our stuff to nations, they change us for it. But we dont change them for it. The stuff we sell as a result is more expensive. Disincentivizeing their people from buying more expensive American products. On top of all that, it's good people here make so much because they can live well. Yet we need more cheap labor to bring down the cost. Explain to me how this position makes any sense."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"This guy had generally pretty reasonable takes. I think his best point on the tariff thing is that, what has totally been missing from this discussion is what other countries are doing. Everyone knows that when two countries have free trade and one implements a tariff there is deadweight loss and it is less efficient. The reality of the situation though is that there are exactly 0 countries globally for the US to trade with that have free markets and no industrial policy / tariffs / capital controls /etc.

If one country tariffs another and the other has no tariffs, the country with the tariffs gains a competitive advantage, while reducing the overall efficiency of the system. It's kind of like the prisoners dilemma in game theory. I think US policy on trade should be based mostly on the idea of cancelling out other countries trade policy as much as possible to create get back to homeostasis where the market is most efficient. If France tariffs American cheese by 10%, doing nothing isn't the closest thing to free trade efficiency, it would be doing something that offsets French tariffs, such as implementing another tariff for the same amount and good. 

In general the west could also benefit from a tax on foreign investment. Overall we have a lot of investment going to non-productive enterprises. If anything there is a glut of capital and not a shortage. That would be a reasonable place to collect revenues, and would help with the asset inflation issue. A 20% tax on foreign capital would not discourage investment much from a lot of countries. Chinese investors, Russian oligarchs, saudi princes, etc, all want to invest in western countries due to the security and high returns, Europe exists but they are not big enough to absorb the entire worlds excess capital like the US does,, we could tax those at high rates. America could have literally 0 foreign investment and there would still have more than enough capital domestically to sustain, all the massive capital inflows do is increase inequality, create asset bubbles, and promote non-productive enterprises that waste resources. These capital inflows are the real source of current American asset inflation, unemployment, trade deficits, and debt, something needs to be done to solve it. I think a tax on foreign investment directly makes more sense than tariffs, and is less likely to spur retaliation."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Trump is my idol 😬
JiIY3MHN7YI,
JiIY3MHN7YI,"I have literally blocked you. I have flagged your content, and I have tried to make sure that my algorithm doesn’t feed me your trash perspective on life, but you still shows up so now I feel obligated to leave comments and make you realize that I hate you."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"I appreciate that Destiny tries to justify his positions, but his analysis on many issues runs skin deep.  His reasoning for not supporting tariffs and USA made products for example.  He hyperbolizes cost of US production where it suits him.  Tom should have pushed back better."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"I appreciate that Destiny tries to justify his positions, but his analysis on many issues runs skin deep.  His reasoning for not supporting tariffs and USA made products for example.  He hyperbolizes cost of US production where it suits him.  Tom should have pushed back better."
JiIY3MHN7YI,Was a nice talk for about an hour and a half. the rest so far has been a mess. Love this guy showing his trump ass.
JiIY3MHN7YI,Destiny out here deleting comments😂😂😂😂😂😂
JiIY3MHN7YI,"The problem is always going to be trickle down doesn’t actually work, it never actually trickles down it’s just hoarded at the top. It’s given out as dividends and stock buybacks far more than any extra profit by lowering tax on the wealthy is reinvested by anyone. Usually they’re borrowing against some other asset or expected future income to invest, there’s little to no evidence that decreased taxes lead to additional hiring which is really what they’re saying here when they mean investing what they want you to believe is that they’re investing in hiring people, and that’s just not been the case… and even when it is it’s not like we’ve been experiencing real wage growth despite significant profit growth for businesses. At this point, unless they voluntarily decide to do it it should be forced upon them, but that sure ain’t going to happen… at least not in my lifetime anymore."
JiIY3MHN7YI,The difference between a VAT and a Tariff are you only pay VAT once at the consumer level. I'm sure he'd love a VAT.
JiIY3MHN7YI,I’m one of those (former) conservative fans of yours that you said you’d laugh at if I was murdered by an assassin. WHEN AND WHERE ARE YOU MOVING OUT OF THE COUNTRY?!?!?!
JiIY3MHN7YI,Trump 2024

JiIY3MHN7YI,I just want to point out how genuinely astonishing it is that Destiny can read up on tax law for fun and then go hold his own against a tax expert in a debate

JiIY3MHN7YI,That meth jaw wont ever go away bud
JiIY3MHN7YI,WHEN / WHERE ARE YOU MOVING OUT OF THE COUNTRY?! BYE FELICIA 😂
JiIY3MHN7YI,Nope
JiIY3MHN7YI,"in addition to greater purchasing power of dollar / currency from tariff revenues used to pay government debt / deficits that reduces inflation, tariffs also keep wages higher with higher export / import prices; so consumers have both higher wages and greater purchasing power of wage dollars / currency, which provides a double stimulus to the economy"
JiIY3MHN7YI,"Destiny started off the debate by saying, ""well I didn't research that"". All he does is do thought experimenmts, and gets corrected after every single one. This was educartional, but I don't feel like this is a real debate, more like business tax lesson for Destiny."
JiIY3MHN7YI,"MOVE OUT DESTINY. Of course you dems never keep your word, nothing new."
JiIY3MHN7YI,let me suggest an all girls lefty pagan music band 4 u. Its called cry cry cry.

JiIY3MHN7YI,My pronouns are Trump/ Won
JiIY3MHN7YI,No one believes your disingenuous rhetoric.
JiIY3MHN7YI,Did you cry last night ? You’re on the wrong side of history. The people have spoken and the popular vote shows the country has had enough of people like you and everything you stand for. Debate that.
JiIY3MHN7YI,Suck it Destiny!!
JiIY3MHN7YI,@DESTINY   You said you are moving out of the COUNTRY .... I hope you do LIVE videos of you MOVING and setting up shop in new country!!!!!!   11/6/24   I would tune into that.
JiIY3MHN7YI,"revenues from tariffs used to pay government debt / deficits increase the purchasing power of dollar / currency by reducing the need to increase the money supply / print money; the increased purchasing power of dollar / currency allows consumers to buy more goods with fewer dollars, reducing price inflation; the more government debt / deficits are reduced by revenues, from tariff as well as other, the greater the purchasing power of dollar / currency can more than overcome the rise in import / export prices"

j_VQqUyylQs,A liar does not need to work…he takes other peoples credit and his voters don’t care.
j_VQqUyylQs,Our democracy is on the line vote blue please as Liz Chaney said don’t sleepwalk into dictatorship and project 2025 their are think tank and special interest groups that want project 2025 to become a reality
j_VQqUyylQs,"Hopefully, Jasmine can come up with a slogan for the Chump as good as the one she made for MTG..."
j_VQqUyylQs,"I don't care that president Biden did not debate well, I will vote for him ."
j_VQqUyylQs,Project 2025 is  for   having all the horrible in government
j_VQqUyylQs,His crezy self wants to take credit for everything.
j_VQqUyylQs,Don't let Joe do any more debates unless you are prepared to ensure that he is rested up and not just returned from a strenuous tour of Europe. Otherwise offer Trump a debate with Jasmine. She's only a rookie so a big man like him should find that easy. Think of the fun it would be. His misogyny would kill him.
j_VQqUyylQs,"I’m from Canada and love Jasmine Crockett and Jamie Raskin,  they always speak the truth unlike Trump who spews lie’s every time he opens his mouth."
j_VQqUyylQs,Isn't she fabulous? Hope she gets an important and prestigious job when Dems win. Definitely Rookie of the year.
j_VQqUyylQs,WAKE UP AMERICA!

j_VQqUyylQs,"Subscribed, I appreciate the positive, but realistic message."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Fortune 500 CEOs do not support Trump.  He will create chaos, which is really bad for the market."
j_VQqUyylQs,"You’re all correct, Biden didn’t appear very quick on his feet during the CNN “debate.” But remember: not all songwriters can sing, not all scriptwriters can act, and not all mechanics can drive race cars. Joe was so flabbergasted by the audacity of Trump’s lies, he let it affect his own performance. Trump talked an awful lot that night but said almost nothing substantial. I would rather fly with a pilot who can land the plane safely than one who is curious if he can barrel roll a 747."
j_VQqUyylQs,"BIDENS debate should not mean anything.  He had a bad night but TRUMPS WERE worse with 30+ lies that NOBODY talks about. He lied every  single  time it was his time to talk.  THAT is not a win.  At least Joe answered the questions.
Joe needs to do anything he can to defeat the Supreme Court.   It is simply gross what they have done.    on TRUMPS REQUEST. 
I am not American but seriously hope that Trump does  not get to the Whitehouse again!!!!!!!     What he and his people have planned could I,pact the world. 
They want America run like Putin or Ping run theirs .   And if people dint take action NOW,!!  This will happen.  Very scary for everyone. Nobody is safe from these hooligans except them!!!!!!       

EVERYBODY needs to get out and vote BLUE  on November5.    Biden/Harris need millions of votes people.   Vote Blue all DOWN  the ballot and make sure your vote is entered INTO THE COMPUTER.      REPUBLICANS ARE VERY BUSY TRYING TO RIG THIS ELECTION.

j_VQqUyylQs,"Crocket for POTUS!

AOC for VP! 

2 women of different  color on the same ticket?

Republican heads would explode!

Worth it!😂"
j_VQqUyylQs,I'm not a fair weather Biden supporter. He's honest and cares about people.
j_VQqUyylQs,"Well, people, it's a Republic, if you can keep it!  Benjamine Franklin."
j_VQqUyylQs,"WATCH, ""DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN"", a movie starring Eddie Murphy in ~ 1999.  This is the modus operandi of the Trump team.  The Trump team is a mirror image of this movie.  Watch it!  Life imitates art!"
j_VQqUyylQs,His base does ZERO research. They follow whatever Trump says.
j_VQqUyylQs,I'd rather vote Biden even if he was in such bad shape that he couldn't finish his term or Kamala serves as acting President than vote Trump or third party any day of the week.
j_VQqUyylQs,"Follow the money, who is behind and in control of the unconstitutional SCOTUS? 

In 2024, WE the people, have seen the actions of a corrupted Supreme Court, a court bought and controlled by a handful of billionaires, not WE the people, that the constitution has already been overthrown. 

The billionaires that have colluded in treason, against the USA have secretly bought SCOTUS and have made WE the people, women, people of color, and simple basic human rights answer to their new constitution, and have invalidated the actual constitutional rights and guidelines. 

These leaders of conman-45, their former king, have put themselves above the law. In fact SCOTUS NOW runs the three “former” equal branches of government and have taken over the USA. They have made themselves the SUPREME lawgivers and above all actual constitutional guidelines.
They think they have ended all checks and balances against their SUPREME POWER. This must be fixed immediately!

The corrupted SCOTUS traitors are so sure that in making tRump beyond reproach, that they can complete THEIR billionaire secret cabal plans and take full power over the USA! Brilliant right? 
MAYBE NOT.

By wielding their food processor that SHREDS the actual constitution, the billionaire cabal by way of the corrupted SCOTUS have created a two edge sword, that must be used to CUT THEM DOWN!
The immunity THEY HAVE CREATED for a former CRIMINAL president, ALSO secures the power of that sword to be used to cut themselves down, by the current actual constitution following President/king Joe Biden.

IF WE the people can use our power or voices quickly, and urge our President/king to take pro-active measures now! WHY quickly? Because WE are only 2 assassins bullets away from ending our current President and VP, and ending America forever! After such assassinations, MAGA Mike Johnson the next king in line, could rule himself or coronate a former king. The probability for this is extremely likely.

Will our current king, Joe Biden, sit weakly by trying to do the optic best good-guy thing or make the HARD decisions he talks about? SCOTUS WILL ACT AND OVERRULE every LEGAL CONSTITUTIONAL action against their planned and functional actual destruction of the real constitution. 

This is no longer an election matter! 

King Biden must act now, to stop the billionaires and their corrupted SCOTUS. WE the people must demand that President Biden, use these SCOTUS enabled powers temporarily, for a law abiding President and round up all of these insurrectionists NOW, starting with SCOTUS and their treasonous cabal billionaire handlers!

Put them all in GITMO, pending their treason trials, and rebuild SCOTUS with provisions to never let the Supreme Court to be come unaccountable again, and put in place all measures like term limits and court accountability and infallible checks and balances for SCOTUS and for all congressmen as well as removing benefits that WE the people do not get like free medical for life and so much more. In addition all members of ALL THREE BRANCHES currently acting in support of this ongoing insurrection must also be housed at GITMO, pending their treason trials as well.

But will king Biden act as he should? Because the billionaire cabal plans and their control over SCOTUS has created a corruption so powerful that the only salvation for our constitutional nation, is to use this new sword in accordance to protect the constitution. Because WE are only 2 bullets away from the END OF AMERICA!

Biden is king by their declaration, and if he goes soft he will be disposed of and or deposed of; either way, only our new king President Biden can ACT to reset the constitution! ALL real patriots and supporters of the actual constitution must support President/king Biden and make America REAL again!"
j_VQqUyylQs,"Uninformed voters will vote for racist criminal Felon trump just on optics, not knowing that Joe Biden did more for the country than that racist criminal Felon trump."
j_VQqUyylQs,Well said Congresswoman Crockett. Vote blue!💙
j_VQqUyylQs,She’s great.
j_VQqUyylQs,So someone comes on and calls someone a liar but have no proof is an idiot. I remember when they passed that bill. And it would not take affect until after the election. And he was supposed to do more. But things happened. The legacy media is here only to spread propaganda. And it is real obvious now. Todays media is for people that don't do research or adolescent minded people.
j_VQqUyylQs,"Jasmine Crockett and Gavin Newsom both gave good interviews about the debate.
The court of public opinion needs to find Trump guilty and sentence him to a large election loss in November.
Get active. Donate to good Democrat candidates. Share information about Project 2025. Speak up.
Project 2025 recommends getting rid of the department of education and environmental protection agency. It is the plan for rule by a dictator and power hungry people."

j_VQqUyylQs,"Just like Jasmine said why wasn’t Joe able to call out trumps lies  , instead Joe tried to answer 3 things at once…."
j_VQqUyylQs,And don't forget we need to completely revamp the supreme court.

j_VQqUyylQs,"I *love* Jasmine: intelligent, well informed, clever, witty,  outspoken and beautiful."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Shame on CNN for not fact checking Trump! I don’t care how bad President Biden was in the debate, I’m still voting for him!  Better than what’s his name!"
j_VQqUyylQs,"Apolitical administration workers and experts keep the state going. Replacing them with incompetent sycophants, and replacing taxes with blanket tariffs, will destroy the US economically.

j_VQqUyylQs,I wish I could hang out with Jasmine for a day. She's the coolest member of Congress we've ever had.
j_VQqUyylQs,"As Allan Lichtman, the historien who predicted the last 10 election outcomes, said: Republicans have no principles, Democrats have no spine.

Oh God, there was a setback, we have to replace Biden, give me a break!! Grow a spine folks! Cult members will vote for the orange menace no matter what. It's time to understand that you don't vote for a single man, but policies, rights and a whole administration behind him. Ask yourself, do you really want to risk future generations to grow up in an authoritarian regime that doesn't care about climate change or women's right just because of a bad debate performance?? Can 90 minutes really destroy 3.5 years of someone fighting to help the American people? 

Even IF Biden weren't able to fulfill his next term, ANYONE, really ANYONE replacing him wouldn't be as bad as the alternative!!"
j_VQqUyylQs,"About voting ""Red"": I find it darkly funny bcuz Chump types were the kind of ppl who had a slogan ""Better dead than Red"". This was from the 1930s til 1990s. Now they wallow in their ""redness"". SMH"
j_VQqUyylQs,Voting all BLUE down ballot in Ohio for the first time in my voting life!!
j_VQqUyylQs,"I've been a third party kind of guy since 1984 until 2018. Straight blue ticket starting in 18. 
I look forward to the time when MAGA is defeated and I can go back to voting third party.

j_VQqUyylQs,"IF this is a Superstar, they have low expectations."
j_VQqUyylQs,"I'm going to stick with Joe and Kamala. The people wanting to replace them are the Reagan Democrats who long for another white Wild Willie Clinton and his wife Hilary. They are the rich opportunist trash of the DNC who love Trickle-Down, hate Obama, and grift the American workers."
j_VQqUyylQs,"I have the biggest crush on her. She’s brilliant, beautiful, classy, sassy, and would make a great president one day."

j_VQqUyylQs,We all know Trump is the biggest liar in the country. Nothing he says or do surprise me. Con man spoiled brat big baby Trump.
j_VQqUyylQs,Jasmine Cricket! What an excellent lovely lady. I love her energy!
j_VQqUyylQs,Biden lied all night too you babbling fool. Why did it take so long for jill to go get joe off the stage? Then she made him use the stairs. Trump was already in his limo headed to his plane before jill rescued joe off the stage. Thats freaking embarrassing!
j_VQqUyylQs,"The people who prep Biden must not be up to speed he never needs to go at Trump hard. Just let him explain stuff, and he twists himself into a pretzel"
j_VQqUyylQs,"ive been trying to stay off political media this weekend because of the braindead punditry.  I went on twitter because a jobapplication asked for my handle and i see #byetimmiller trending.  Tim Miller and the bulwark are the people who originally set me off with their terrible analysis, because while I appreciate their efforts, they are so unaware of their own biases and so snobby about their politics, meanwhile they're part of a political party that does not even exist anymore.

I'm not going to ""cancel them"" , but jesus christ Im not going to waste my time listening to these faithless pundits, especially ex republicans who talk shit about democrats constantly  for 'bedwetting' - so casually too, they say it.  Go watch the Bulwark any day of the week and all youll hear is scared people giving unsolicited advice to the Biden campaign with ZERO introspection, if they knew what they were talking about they wouldn't be part of a political party that consists of only them and their friends.

""Cancelling"" anybody over this is just childish and stupid, but I'm absolutely not going to waste my time listening to people who confidently say things without the expertise or knowledge to say them.  I've become a better news analyst then the people I listened to when I first started, because my thoughts are my own thoughts and I don't jump to conclusions."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Jasmine is an awesome person, keep fighting the fight."
j_VQqUyylQs,What is that noise on this video.
j_VQqUyylQs,This fool…. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
j_VQqUyylQs,"Trump is a lie machine, but I'm if Joe spent a week at Camp David training for anything else then WTH. Everyone else is doing great fact checking afterwards. we needed Joe to do it on stage when the most people, independents are watching. Any Joe apart from the one that Hur described in the classified files case. You're all trying to lock the door after the horse have bolted. Any other Biden would have done what Jasmine, Kamala, Newsome, and a pile of others are doing now. Any other Biden and I would be booking my holiday to America next year. Now I have to wait and hope"
j_VQqUyylQs,Ha ha ha!!! Trumo was correct about what he did for insulin prices.
j_VQqUyylQs,"Congress... ENOUGH happy bs... DO SOMETHING... scotus is out of control,  Macron lost to LePen and handed the EU over to Orbon and the Orange AH isn't going to be tried??? Possibly ''ascending to the presidency''??? I AM DONE with both parties... you are incompetent and Texas Paul's excuse is ''we don't know how to fight like that""""  THEN GET THE FKOUT OF THE GAME. I've never h8ed this government more... FK THEM and everyone who gave the public false hope  KNOWING what the outcome was long ago. Garland, Wray, Biden, Trump.... GFTY"
j_VQqUyylQs,"Standing around lying, making up stories, and calling others schoolyard names is NOT debating. Trump is weak. He’s a sissy. He’s spineless. He’s a whiner. He obviously has no ideas of his own because steals credit for ideas he’s too stupid to comprehend. . He conveniently can’t “make it to court” to face his rape victim
And confront her about the lies she’s “concocted”.  He conveniently can’t testify at the hearing of another woman who has “spread malicious lies about him.”  And  MAGAts think this wimp is an ideal man??  Seriously.   The poor idiot can’t fight his own battles."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Love, love miss. Crockett🎉💙💙💙"
j_VQqUyylQs,America smarten up if your not rich your not a republican trump quote I love the poorly educated. Why ? Because only Rich men and morons vote for republicans.
j_VQqUyylQs,Republicans are a horrible waste of taxpayer money and they need to be voted out drain the republican Swamp by voting Blue City State and Federal Gov. That said President Joe Biden had a bad night but 4 great years as our President right now The United States economy is the envy of the world because Wall Street is hitting new highs because the Stock Market’s are still Bullish because unemployment is low and Job numbers are up and US debt is coming down and the United States is producing more oil than any other oil producing countries and that makes us Energy independent. And even republicans are voting for Joe. Listen When your Team is having a Winning Season you don’t Fire your Head Coach just because he stutters unless your a maga moron. America smarten up if your not rich your not republicans vote for President Joe Biden 4 more years of progress and prosperity for everyone 🇺🇸😎.
j_VQqUyylQs,"In the wild way of politics, Jasmine,Jasmin Crockett, the queen of the maga smash.(You know the Davey Crockett song)
I Would be absolutely riveted to the screen if Jasmine went one on one with that moron trump in a televised debate.

j_VQqUyylQs,RIDIN WITH BIDEN 2024. DEMOCRACY OVER DICTATORSHIP
j_VQqUyylQs,"Here's the deal: Unless Biden voluntarily gives up his 90% of the primary votes, THERE IS NO procedure to make another candidate appear like IRON MAN or caped crusader.  Besides, 1st shot would be Kamala, or pizz off all people of color, and she's already in the succession if Biden falters.
Sunday night gathering was for a photo shoot, so all drama queens can unclutch those pearls.
Wherever Biden's going, it's on a redemption tour, and (gasp!) he's TAKING NOTES with him."
j_VQqUyylQs,34 count convicted lying felon trump is a lunatic that needs to be in prison asap 
j_VQqUyylQs,Words come out of trumps mouth like a hurracine from the south what biden does speaks volumes
j_VQqUyylQs,Magats try to take credit for what Biden's administration has done because they haven't done anything good themselves.  Every one of them are traitors and Putin's puppets!!!  💙🌊🗣️
j_VQqUyylQs,"The only people panicking about Thursday night was the Pundit class and a few Democratic operatives, but these other Candidates had a bad first debate, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barrack Obama against John McCain and Mitt Romney and Donald Trump in 2016 and then there's the Sh*t show first debate in 2020. The last time they did have to replace a Candidate was Lyndon Johnson with Hubert Humphries, who had no Campaign Funding because the money raised by Lyndon Johnson went with him, Humphries had to start fundraising from scratch and didn't have the time to build a good Campaign around him and he lost by 1% to Richard Nixon. 
It was one bad night people and so far the voters seem to be staying with President Biden and the debate audience was around 50 Million people which is considerably lower than most debate night audiences, so it could be that the Orange Messiah reduced the number of viewers because of everything dragging him down, Convicted Felon, Sexual Assaulter and defamer and having stolen and retained National and International Defence Documents AND a Conspiracy Theorist and Liar. 
The North Carolina Rally seems to have shown us that the President did have one bad night and that he had a cold, was tired and over prepared for the debate, he will be fine and everyone should continue ""Ridin With Biden"" to protect Civil Rights, democracy, the US, Ukraine, Gaza, Europe and the rest of the World."
j_VQqUyylQs,"I love all the Heroines in our party!!!!!!! I choose DEMOCRACY over Dictatorship.  I choose public schools over no funding for school, I choose social security over poverty, I choose safe pregnancies for my younger sisters, I choose Mother Earthʼs health over destroying the environment with no regulations. I choose our Constitution over whatever rules Trump decides to invent to benefit himself."
j_VQqUyylQs,I gave 34!
j_VQqUyylQs,This is like the Supreme Court trying to make decisions on Federal policy.😮
j_VQqUyylQs,0:10 did someone fart in the Mic? 😂
j_VQqUyylQs,Miss Jasmine Crockett is freaking FANTASTIC!!!
j_VQqUyylQs,DJT-is a Putin puppet
j_VQqUyylQs,I am a veteran and am equally infuriated by the fact that tRump also again falsely took credit for the Choice program inacted under Obama that allows veterans like myself to seek medical care outside of the VA when they can't provide the care within 30 days. I have taken advantage of that program for care that had been delayed prior to 2015 when Obama enacted it.
j_VQqUyylQs,She is the realist they need to put her out thier as a surrogate
j_VQqUyylQs,"I love that she refers to Donald Trump as ""this fool.""  I usually refer to him as ""that fool."" 😂"
j_VQqUyylQs,ESPECIALLY YOUR RIGHT JESSIAH MY HERO 🦸‍♂️ NONE OF THEM WON THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AND CONVICTED GELOM DONALD TRUMP SHOULD DROP OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
j_VQqUyylQs,Please Vote 💙 Donald Duck Is Bad Business For The World
j_VQqUyylQs,GREAT JOB CONGRESS SUPER HERO 🦸‍♂️ JASMINE CROCKETT DESTROYING CONVICTED FELON DONALD TRUMP ON HIS FAILED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
j_VQqUyylQs,"Crocket joins the club of Rasken, Moscowitz, Porter and several others who have a track record of good legislation and calling out the Clown Kar boobs. You keep the pressure up Mame❤❤❤👍👍"
j_VQqUyylQs,Congresswoman  crocett is my favorite congresswoman.
j_VQqUyylQs,Biden needs to drop out and get someone into that place and Jasmine should either run or she should be the VP
j_VQqUyylQs,"""FOOL"" 😂😂"
j_VQqUyylQs,"The people surrounding Biden should have done what Trump advisors would've done had Trump been as senile as Biden and just refused to debate at all.
It was a terrible performance from Biden.
The Democratic party were warned that Biden is really old and picking him to run again was a mistake.
Both candidates are bad but for very different reasons.
Biden knows how to run a country successfully whereas Trump couldn't run a Casino.
The Democrats need to grow a pair and pick some young blood for christ sake!"
j_VQqUyylQs,Jasmine is awesome
j_VQqUyylQs,Crockett future president in the making
j_VQqUyylQs,"Who among us has not had a ""bad day"" during our work history? Disappointed does not begin to describe my reaction to Joe's performance, but I did my best to boost the effort by donating to the cause afterward. We know that Joe can do the job, even if we don't always agree with him. But Trump has not a clue about being ""President."" To him, it's akin to being a carnival barker."
j_VQqUyylQs,Jasmine Crockett please marry me...
j_VQqUyylQs,"1:35 And thats where Democrats need to focus... It isn't just a vote for Biden, it is voting for Jasmine, Mayor Pete, Newson, Katie Porter, AOC and *every other* Democrat fighting for us in DC and around the nation in local governments. You arent just voting for Biden and Harris!!! Lol You are voting for actual leadership across the board. This isn't about Biden, he is just the key that opens the door. So quit complaining about the shape of the key and just open the f*cking door to progress. This was never about 1 man for Democrats... We are not a cult like them. Lol 
""you improvise, you adapt, you overcome""
Semper Fi💙"
j_VQqUyylQs,"Biden campaign should be putting Jasmine Crockett front and center. She should be their hype ♀️ 
Shit, you want Biden to step down, here's your president. She'd be awesome. Hopefully, real soon, she'll be president"
j_VQqUyylQs,PROJECT 2025 isn't just for Trump.  It's set up for the next republican president period.  This is what they plan to do regardless of who's their nominee going into the future.
j_VQqUyylQs,I'm voting blue no matter what.🤨💙💙
j_VQqUyylQs,You step down you Republican no good Criminals...😠😠😠😠😠 Lying Morons..
j_VQqUyylQs,VOTE BLUE to stop the DEMON Donald Trump from destroying our Democracy.🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸🌹✟🙏😎
j_VQqUyylQs,A the rest of you democratic get off your ass and fight!🤣🤣🤣🤣
j_VQqUyylQs,Folks let me remind you that the Democratic party was the ones that elected Trump in 2016 because of the division within the party like we have now and if we don't unite behind Biden our division will cause us to lose all branches of government and then you can kiss your Democracy and freedom bye forever and women rights. It's time for Democrats to grow up and let's keep this dictator out of office.
j_VQqUyylQs,"I think the good majority of the country saw that Donald Trump was lying, and I think we are wasting time combating his lies right now, right now we need to be rallying behind Joe Biden and realized what actually happened in that debate and that was that they brought out joe biden's greatest weakness and that is his stutter, Joe Biden is not demented, he is elderly and he has a stutter"
j_VQqUyylQs,The felon is trying to take credit for every good thing President Biden has done. He is also trying to say he did more for the American people than President Biden. As a family of veterans we think the Felon is a threat to American and our allies.
j_VQqUyylQs,We The Hardest Working American People And Families We Must Never Ever Stop Defending Our Democracy And Freedom 💯🙏
j_VQqUyylQs,GO CROCKETT GO!! ❤❤❤
j_VQqUyylQs,I gave after the debate. I gave for democracy.
j_VQqUyylQs,"We can't keep going over all Donald Trump's lies there is a method actually to his madness that night and that was playing up when Joe Biden's stutter, it's called the Gish method, and why they had a debate I'll never know, but donald trump continually constantly and rapidly spit out lies so fast that no one could respond not even the moderators because you don't know where to start and where to end, that was a very successful trick by the republicans and by the way the Russians also use that trick, the American people need to calm down and the television pundits need to shut the hell up and stop influencing our elections"
j_VQqUyylQs,MAGA DEI but it's about loyalty to Trump.
j_VQqUyylQs,Trump also tried to take credit for Obama's choice program for Veterans.  He's said that multiple times.  I got my choice card under the Obama admin.
j_VQqUyylQs,"That's the problem with Democrats. They don't stick together and they don't ask Trump the right questions. When he said, Childcare was not important enough, Democrats should've jumped all over that. That was the perfect answer to prove his disconnect to regular people because he's never needed Childcare."
j_VQqUyylQs,I love that woman! ❤🤍💙
j_VQqUyylQs,"Velshi, thank you for mentioning the pearl clutching.  My party (Democrats) need to stay the hell on message.  Republicans have us beat on staying on message"
j_VQqUyylQs,C’mon we need to do an intervention on Biden to step down. Trump will otherwise win and not treat the Biden family well in the country they have served.
j_VQqUyylQs,"Democrat  are  not  freaking out!
The pundits  Trump and magas
Wish  that we were. We will
Continue  to support  president 
Biden because  he has  done  a Phenomenal.job for we Americans
Period."
j_VQqUyylQs,"This election is about one thing, dictatorship or democracy."
j_VQqUyylQs,She's a super hero - watch out Trumpty Dumpty
j_VQqUyylQs,"In a perfect world, Biden steps down and the entire party gets behind Newsom as president and Kamela as VP. 

Unfortunately its not a perfect world. Biden would only endorse Kamela as replacement and if the party could unite behind her, it could work. But if Biden stepped down, its the DNC who picks the nominee and it would throw the party into chaos."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Just like the saying goes "" UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL!""- anyone who loves our country and our freedom should be rallying behind Biden through this campaign on the road to victory, no matter how bumpy the journey may sometimes get. Showing strength in solidarity against a common threat to our democracy and our very way of life. Not breaking and running scared at the first signs of trouble and/or temporary setbacks that may arise. Trump wants to be a king, a dictator, a god. He wants to undo 200 years of progress by taking away the constitution, our rights, our freedoms, our voice! Women,minorities, the disabled, seniors, and veterens will lose and suffer greatly. The poor will get poorer and the rich richer. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness- The American Dream will become just that. A DREAM! If we are to save our country and our democracy people need to rise up, stand tall with pride, and fight with conviction for this great nation. Tell Trump, Maga, and anyone else who would see our country fall to Go To Hell before we end up living in one! Your voice matters, your vote matters. #VoteforBiden #VoteBlue"
j_VQqUyylQs,"If they push Biden out, i will not support Democrats ever again. The Democratic party should have instantly backed Biden, why they didn't is the damn problem they have to begin with, they are wishy washy. They need to stand up for Biden because no one else will beat trump, how ridiculous are these idoits. If Biden doesn't run we will end up with trump as the president again. Surely they arent that crazy. I love jasmine Crockett, by the way!"
j_VQqUyylQs,This is not going to undo what the world saw
j_VQqUyylQs,Jasmine should be on the campaign trail because she’s a very strong woman who can deliver a positive message to the voters and she has the ability to make a strong rationale and point out the fact that trump is a liar who is a convicted felon and a rapist and is responsible for the insurrection and was found liable of fraud and ordered to pay 450 million dollars in damages and another 88 million dollars for his defamation of the woman he sexually assaulted and he has been indicted for espionage in Florida and election interference in Georgia and he has said that he will deport millions of immigrants and dismantle the civil employee and replace with his own loyalists and so on. So I hope that she will do some campaigning.
j_VQqUyylQs,"Unfortunately the small sect of voters that actually matter.....they're not watching this, or MSNBC , or Nbc even."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Stay foucs democrats,  keep your
Eyes on the. Prize, our democracy. 
Let the lying  pundits  and Republicans  tell. All these lies 
On us.  Action speaks  louder
Than lies. Vote vote  vote blue.
Thats all we have to do."

🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉"
j_VQqUyylQs,"there were several times trump took credit for things that happened when he was out of office or blamed biden when he was still there. Things like blaming biden for the border or taxes or covid deaths, biden didnt react to rebuke his lies and instead talked his policy."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Trump. ""Loud and Wrong."""
j_VQqUyylQs,I'll choose Biden on life support before i would ever vote for the orange buffoon

j_VQqUyylQs,I'm a grassroots donor after the debate.  Biden 2024 !!!!!
j_VQqUyylQs,"There’s no chose here, Biden or buzz"
j_VQqUyylQs,"Only in America would the greatest president for accomplishments in decades be mocked and disrespected, told he's unfit, because he had a few mishaps in a debate because of old age, seniors bog down later in the day and get burnout but are good to go the next am, and you want to reelect a former failed president that blew the economy in the first place over his covid failure, Joe should step aside give trump the keys and give the people what they want, and deserve, because he's not appreciated"
j_VQqUyylQs,Crockett is a very smart individual! Everyone vote blue in November 💙 🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸
j_VQqUyylQs,"Just Donated the first time this election cycle to Joe Biden, John Ossof, Collin Aldred and Vindman."

j_VQqUyylQs,"Jasmine you are a treaure for us!  Thank you!  Well done!  You show our fire and our energy, when we can't do it anything like you do!   Great work!"
j_VQqUyylQs,Because some American 🇺🇸 sit down and listen 👂 to the debate 🤔 the word of the debate what was coming out of there mouth when the question was being ask the right answer you was suppose to be giving ? Not lie after lie no matter how slow it is and Trump is slow in the head too 🤪 and but nobody say nothing about that 😡.
j_VQqUyylQs,I'm betting that this time next year leftists are going to hate democracy 🤣
j_VQqUyylQs,She rox!!!
j_VQqUyylQs,"Chump supporters are either uneducated, or complicit.. The notion that one can try and argue that Chump is somehow fit for the office of Presidency is laughable after what he's shown us he is capable of. The mere fact that he doesn't have an ounce of integrity, & lies every time he opens his mouth. Would be enough to disqualify him from most jobs but The blatant disrespect, and disregard for military members whom served this country is abhorrent. 

Why even waste time trying to educate them.. Let them believe what they want to believe... They are the smallest group in the room, jus so happens they make the most noise... It's a dead issue,  Chump hasn't gain support over the last years, he's lost support! The Republican party has imploded. This doesn't mean that the Democrat party is so much better but since it comes down to these two as the choice.. Only one is a safe choice,  the other is a pathological liar, that is purely in this for his own purpose and benefits.  As the saying goes ""Fool me once, shame on you... Fool me twice, Shame on me""🫡"
j_VQqUyylQs,For sure Biden 2024💯💯💯 no questions asked
j_VQqUyylQs,She's not a star. She's a loud mouth victim.

j_VQqUyylQs,Crockett for 2028 POTUS
j_VQqUyylQs,"Everyone is crazy if they think we will walk blindly into a dictatorship with Donald Trump. Idc how bad Joe Biden did, we are not changing direction this late in the game no matter what."
j_VQqUyylQs,"FYI PRES. Reagan used 25-30% of the plan offered by the Heritage; Trump used 60% of the Heritage foundation while he was in office.
This Heritage plan is NOT NEW so they have been conditioning the Republicans for years. We Must stop them!!"
j_VQqUyylQs,Jasmine Crockett is an exceptional representative. We need to fill upcoming seats with quality individuals such as this remarkable human being!
j_VQqUyylQs,"I love how she keeps calling him ""that fool"" 😂"
j_VQqUyylQs,Raskin:Crockett ticket!
j_VQqUyylQs,💙
j_VQqUyylQs,The MAGA 2025 Plan is a modern day rewrite of the Mudsill Theory.
j_VQqUyylQs,"Have I told you guys I love this lady? ""JASMINE CROCKETT FOR PRESIDENT!!!"""
j_VQqUyylQs,"Reducing Social Security deductions for Medicare to zero, tax-free, by executive action could potentially influence votes. Try It in September."
j_VQqUyylQs,"I love Jasmin, she's the best."
j_VQqUyylQs,It is Clear the Orangutan is so full of BS it just spews forth from his mouth. I have been saying that people need to believe what he says. He really is that CRAZY!  That was no debate it was a carnival barker trying to look tough.
j_VQqUyylQs,"CNN was definitely Team Trump in the debate!! I do NOT know about anyone else, but I am boycotting CNN"
j_VQqUyylQs,"President Biden had a sore throat, CNN cut him off and turned his microphone off so many times!! I am NOT making excuses for him, but it seems like CNN was team Trump!! All Trump did was lie, try to take credit for things President Biden did, and lie more!!"
j_VQqUyylQs,"This is delusional. He is too old. Period. I take no pleasure in saying that, but Biden not stepping down is essentially forfeiting the election to Trump."
j_VQqUyylQs,"Love Jasmine Crockett!!! VOTE BLUE 2024!! we need the house, 60 in the senate and the white house!!!💙💙💙💙💙💙"
j_VQqUyylQs,The debate was bad but I will vote for President Biden. Trump for years in prison! Trump proved he was a liar and not fit to run the US.
j_VQqUyylQs,Switch dem VP to her ....keep Biden... Pretty simple....would shake things up
j_VQqUyylQs,"DOWNVOTED and ""Do Not Recommend this channel"" pos!"
j_VQqUyylQs,"Yep, he tried to take credit for most everything Biden has done, we KNOW better you fool, we need her and others to shout it out!"
j_VQqUyylQs,Doing nothing....is a choice....and the stakes are too high
j_VQqUyylQs,"Trump, the Liar In-Chief.  You judge actions, not words."
j_VQqUyylQs,"You know, she looks to f'n Cool. I worked with beauties, some are stunning singers, they would go off in the store, I would freeze, telling her Keep Going."
j_VQqUyylQs,I totally agree with you and thank you for being a great source that brings us the truth!!!
j_VQqUyylQs,WAKE UP!  It’s time to take on PROJECT 2025 head on!!!
j_VQqUyylQs,Jasmine Corckett speaks as if she's been in Congress for years.  A star is born and  I'm happy as hell she's a Democrat.  Vote blue 💙💙💙 top to bottom.
j_VQqUyylQs,"https://youtu.be/KQZHs6SndOc?feature=shared
Donald Trump audibly crapped his pants during the debate and Joe Biden wasn't the man capable of pointing that out to millions of people on live television. We need a candidate to wave Donald's dirty diaper under his nose. He crapped his pants sitting right next to Dianne Feinstein. The look on her face is priceless: ""You dirty MF"". 
Is this the most consequential election of our lifetime? Is the Gestapo knocking at the door? I think it is. We need a candidate that gets people excited about beating Fascists, bigots, criminals, sex offenders, liars, thieves, traitors, insurrectionists"
j_VQqUyylQs,This campaign shoud be a Democratic blow out..... Something is wrong with the DNC strategy
boJiZb8Fb4M,Isn't the idea of a debate to help determine who people want to vote for? Fox is mad that people are endorsing Harris at a difficult time for Trump. Awwwww😢
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Of course Trump won't have put pen (or sharpie) to paper; he's barely literate.  I'm sure he hasn't ""read"" the 900 pages himself.  But he has people read parts of it to him,  he works with them to make their plan happen, and he supports them in every way."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump said he doesn't enforce project 2025. You stupid idiots need to learn how to listen you stupid bastards.
boJiZb8Fb4M,"It's really telling that elite conservatives openly acknowledge that the more people who learn about their *actual goals*, the more regular, real people are repulsed by their ideas."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Why are people focusing on ""This is Trump's plan"" and not ""THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN PLAN"".  It isn't MAGA that supports this, it's the billionaires backing Trump. They will not go away when Trump is defeated."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Project 2025 affects tens of thousands of voters...which way do you think they will vote?...go Biden/Harris...
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump's name pops up 312 times in the search for it in Project 2025 and 22 times alone being mentioned in the section of the Authors' short biogragraphies at the beginning of the manifesto.
boJiZb8Fb4M,Spread Far and Wide...
boJiZb8Fb4M,These people have no bottom period!!!!🤬😤😡😤🤬💯
boJiZb8Fb4M,Great 👍 👌 👍
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Yes. Spread the word about Proj 2025. 
And 🗳💙🇺🇲"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Replacing Biden, even with Harris, will be a BIG mistake. Think about it. Let's say Harris replaces Biden and she wins in November, Trump will NEVER accept the results. He will file a lawsuit for whatever BS reason to invalidate the presidential election. He will win because he has the justices and judges to do it. The next person in line to be POTUS is the Speaker of the House, MAGA Mike Johnson. As POTUS, Johnson will bring in Project 2025. 

Mainstream media is focusing on the WRONG thing. Biden is old, we're ALL older than we were, especially living every day hearing BS about or from Trump. Biden is doing the job now. He has his cabinet members and Congressional Dems helping him, as they are now.

The Heritage Foundation (HF) is a think tank. I wish legacy media and the George Clooneys of the world would stop playing checkers by focusing on Biden's age and start playing chess like the HF. HF is playing the long game and while legacy media is focusing on insignificant things in the grander scheme of HF coming for the US government from all directions and on all levels."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Wake up people vote blue 💙💙💙💙
boJiZb8Fb4M,Vote blue people vote blue 💙💙 no project 25 forever!! No trump and his asshats!! No church and state!!!!!
boJiZb8Fb4M,"People need to remember, it's not about just Biden, it's the party and thr people behind him that are not Trump and his bootlickers"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"How about Tylor talk with someone, an expert on project 2025. Let them explain to her and her flock what it really is."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Keep in mind EVERY single Representative and Senator at the Federal level has signed on to Project 2025. If you live in a red state, a vote for your state's Federal Senator or Representative is a vote for Project 2025. This goes for those you elect for your state level representation."
boJiZb8Fb4M,I’ve been screaming about this to my friends and they brushed it off. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I’m so grateful that Taraji got this FINALLY in the mainstream media!!!!!! “It’s about DAMN TIME.” - Lizzo
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump's name is mentioned in Project 2025 312 times!!!!!!
boJiZb8Fb4M,"The very absurdity of questioning President Biden’s cognition while ignoring the demented rambling of trump every time he gets to a microphone is just laughable. 
Vote blue 💙"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"With the Democrats deserting Biden, the Republicans close ranks around Trump's lies, and hate. We lose."
boJiZb8Fb4M,trump has been on record saying that Republicans were stupid enough to be manipulated by a buffoon like himself (he said it differently in an attempt to appear “smart”) 😂😂
boJiZb8Fb4M,Why aren’t there more calls for 🍊🤡 to remove himself?! 🍊🤡 is devastating for America! Vote  blue 🗳️
boJiZb8Fb4M,"That's because they are finally opening up their eyes, he is just a loser. Whining about the election was rigged against him, he has to realize that no one else believes him. Vote 💙💙."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"I hope the FBI and the IRS are looking into these domestic terrorists. Because of course they are   501(c)(3). Good ol “religious” tax exempt. 
🤢🤮."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"At least 140 ppl from dumps administration had a hand in project 2025...
An thats from ...
fn ..CNN..👹..."
boJiZb8Fb4M,It's up to Joe Biden who's going to win the next election. He must decide.
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Correction, he was a useful idiot, a tool for the likes of traitors such as bannon and miller not to mention the enemies of America, putin, xi jinping and kim jong un."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Could you do a story about priorities,  what people in America think a rapist is better than an old man that might die in office?"
boJiZb8Fb4M,I hope that all that is reading it can see what Trump is up to and will vote against him!! I also hope Taylor Swift will take all of her followers to the poll and vote against Trump!!!!!
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Taylor swift was born in I believe 1989 not an American tradition. Maybe Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Billy Joel or my fav the Grateful Dead might be considered an American tradition but ta ta …..yeah that’s a hard NO as far as being an American tradition. FYI I have nothing but respect for Taylor because of all the good shit she’s done and I guess she’s a decent musician, wouldn’t really know…."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Its looks like they been writing down everything they hate since Nixon resigned. And found out if you can't get American's to vote with you, just buy the government one judge, one president at a time ."
boJiZb8Fb4M,No. Reagan would endorse it. 😊
boJiZb8Fb4M,Highlight the trump administration connections by what positions they held in his administration 😊
boJiZb8Fb4M,Taylor Swift needs to alert her fans about project 2025😊
boJiZb8Fb4M,"his ideas are getting BIG ratings, he's gonna be so excited! 
Oh, he's upset about it? He doesn't want people to find out what his plans are for our country? That's ... scary"
boJiZb8Fb4M,If trump wins he is deporting his black and Latinos supporters 😂
boJiZb8Fb4M,The only thing you need to know to inform the public of this agenda already being implemented is that in the project 2025 plan the only government agency that is not involved is the Supreme Court because they already have a super majority in their control! The plan includes every other government agency and their powers to do whatever they wish to gain complete control and authority over the independent agency and the people who work for them to install loyal individuals to be the culprits and corrupt entities to discharge the orders of a treasonous presidential administration!
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump delivered abortion bans for the religious right you can bet your life that he will deliver “project 2025” to them as well.  Trump will brag about it too when he thinks he’s in the clear. Right now he wants his dummies to blindly vote for his cult of personality instead of his plan to give religion control of America. Just look at his religious SCOTUS and the power they gave him should he become president. Kick the conservative plan to the curb. To save America vote Joe and Kamala!
boJiZb8Fb4M,💙🇺🇸💙
boJiZb8Fb4M,"CNN is dropping the ball so badly right now when it matters the most. I am disgusted. All they cover is replacing Biden. Not the lies Trump spewed on the debate stage, not Project 2025, not the corrupt Supreme Court, not the ""There wont be blood if the Democrats dont allow it"", The clear climate change, newly released Epstein files, not the corruption from the Trump family, nothing! Only replacing Biden, other countries' elections etc. Hyper focused securely on anyone saying Biden should step down. What networks loke CNN are clearly avoiding and focusing on should be the number one subject being talked about everyday. It first was clear to me when the debate happened. It may as well been Hannity and Laura ingrahm. I have watched CNN for years, but I dont blindly fallow anything or anyone and I smell something rotten...... Does everyone have a price, even when it comes to our great country???? Btw, the best moderator for a debate I have seen was from FOX, CHRIS WALLACE. And he did it by himself! Trump better hope they dont pick the channel 9 guy from Calorado for the next debate......"
boJiZb8Fb4M,Have Americas finally discovered how to use Google?
boJiZb8Fb4M,"C'mon Taylor do your thing, spread your magic and save democracy"
boJiZb8Fb4M,GET OUT AND SPREAD THE WORD FOR BIDEN FOLKS - WE CAN'T RELY ON THE MEDIA. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE HERE. PUT YOUR POSTS INTO REAL ACTION!
boJiZb8Fb4M,You would have to be pretty stupid if you believe trump is not connected to project 2025.
boJiZb8Fb4M,It’s all about the ratings with Trump. Always has been 😕
boJiZb8Fb4M,All Chump understands is RATINGS....THIS IS NOT A REALITY SHOW ...TRUMP you af
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Oh my god. Is this really happening?  Is MAGA really about to be thwarted because everyone found their CD for explaining their evil plan to their 6 year old advisor? Like a cheesy spie movie?

It's an appropriately pathetic way to bring an end to them. 5:21"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"He admires dictators because he wants to be one, blue down ballot, this election could be our last."
boJiZb8Fb4M,By the way this is global. Check out how many people are Googling Project 2025 in different countries around the world. People around the world are concerned about it
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Trump used the Heritage Foundation’s recommendations 64% in his first term! 
The use of Heritage Foundation’s Recommendations started with Reagan when he gave it to his cabinet and used 60%in his domestic plan!! Bush used the control of Press during the War. 
Heritage has been slowly ruining our government for years!"
boJiZb8Fb4M,Do you think the fear of these damning and incriminating affiliation’s are making citizens silent or more emboldened? For? Against?
boJiZb8Fb4M,"“Unpack” has become the most overused word of late, much like “orbit” a few years back.   Can we try alternatives such as “we will expand/elaborate on that”, “more details to follow” …"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Down with Project 2025
Down with Trump Biden 2024 💙💙💙🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump's Project 2025 is a sh*t show. I started reading it yesterday. Women will be second class citizens and the Old Orange Fascist will be king for life. - Gen Z
boJiZb8Fb4M,"I’ll vote for the guy who’s not on the Epste!n flight logs several times, thank you. Vote Blue! Biden/Harris 2024"
boJiZb8Fb4M,But he will do it all if elected.
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump always hates it when the truth is told. He hides like a cockroach in the dark and puts on that spray tan to pretend he has any connection to the light at all.
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Are the Maga's too idiot to realize that project 2025 will affect them as well, even the ones that are working on the project? It will affect every American!!!"
boJiZb8Fb4M,What ever trump says is a lie all he does is lie
boJiZb8Fb4M,By default all those tfg supporting media CEOs are complicit.
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump’s dictator plans like Hitler’s has caught up with him and the republican senate and house and Supreme Court they have been exposed in their coup and conspiracies against their oaths and the constitution and constitutional rights and freedoms of all Americans. That is an insurrection and a criminal enterprise all raped up in one. Justice will prevail None of these people are above the law.
boJiZb8Fb4M,So true about this  and trump  the biggest lies trump and Crooked stupid trump 😅😊
boJiZb8Fb4M,😮😅😂😂😅 i love it.
boJiZb8Fb4M,"But it's not actually at the top according to the graph, people please stop the B.S. don't be like the MAGAOTS."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"JUST LIKE ""HE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT KKK"" RIGHT?"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"The Dirty Diaper has no clue that his top aides, responsible for some of his most inhumane policies during his admin, who are still part of his team, are major players in another attack on Democracy.  I call BS."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Remember, everyone: just because project 2025 is now becoming a common topic, the fact that people have been working on and AGAINST it for a ~very~ long time. We need to listen to reason more quickly. Politics needs to be a good conversation, not one to be avoided, going forward."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Project 2025 is a dystopian nightmare  we have to defeat their blueprint to end Democracy 😢
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Agenda 47 is a snaphot of Project 2025. This sh*t is cra cra 🤪. Is anyone paying attention to the fact  he's running for the 47th president, skipping over 46, just to keep the election lie  going!!"
boJiZb8Fb4M,DEMOCRATS ... LISTEN UP  ... PROJECT 2025 SHOULD BE ON HARD REPEAT!!
boJiZb8Fb4M,INSANITY🍊🔥👹🐷🚫
boJiZb8Fb4M,The Cats out of the 🎒 BAG🍊🔥👹🐷🚫
boJiZb8Fb4M,"When trump says “they are not coming after him they are coming after you”, believe him!"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Trump is a LIAR. He knows all about Project 2025 and would use it on his day one dictatorship. What would he do on his day one dictatorship? Purge the government of 50,000+ civil servants. Where is that idea and plan found? Project 2025. ~40 out of ~50 9; the authors of project 2025 are his FORMER ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS. Trump will distance himself from P25 now and use it the second he got into office. He needs to remain President to keep out of jail. He needs p25 to transform our democracy into his kingdom in earth."
boJiZb8Fb4M,The Christian terrorists will turn those who defend the constitution against them.
boJiZb8Fb4M,I wonder what maga will think when the traitor is named in the Epstein documents? He won't be just a convicted felon or a traitor but also a pedophile 😮
boJiZb8Fb4M,"REMEMBER DONNIE LOST 2020 and his J6th coup attempt, fake electors, find me 11,780 votes. Vote 💙freedom from the maga-religion-cult."
boJiZb8Fb4M,The shit just hit the fan!!!
boJiZb8Fb4M,Vote 💙🇺🇸 for our democracy
boJiZb8Fb4M,He’s always dishonest
boJiZb8Fb4M,His attitude of its always someone else is doing something
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Trump for the Big House, not the White House"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Taylor, please endorse officially Pres Biden!"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"The right message is finally getting out. Two weeks bashing Joe Biden (old, but not a wanna-be dictator) v Donald Trump (a convicted felon, r*pist and domestic terrorist) who has an odd fixation about electric batteries sinking ships and Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. Old beats Crazy."
boJiZb8Fb4M,We all need to keep Project 2025 trending through the election! Share! Share! Share!
boJiZb8Fb4M,More Fake News lies ! Trump has nothing to do with Project 2025 and also disavowed it ! Bye-done !
boJiZb8Fb4M,You know you guys are losers hoping Taylor swift is your savior 😂
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump’s plans are criminal and they know it.
boJiZb8Fb4M,Unfortunately Google is a private company so they could start interfering.
boJiZb8Fb4M,Put their nightmare plan on BLAST
boJiZb8Fb4M,So the pulse of what's important in American is based off of Google searches between Taylor Swift and Project 2025? This country is fcked.
boJiZb8Fb4M,I still think Bidens gonna win (even though I’m not a fan).  You’re telling me that over 7 million people are going to change their minds and vote for trump and the hard-right ideology?  I just don’t buy it.
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Considering that Trumps aids are frustrated, it goes to show that Project 2025 was supposed to be under the radar, we weren't supposed to know about it."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Someday time will give us justice against Trump. Let’s make sure the maga party isn’t in power when his time on earth comes to an end because they will appoint a new king who will likely be even more of a monster. Their plan is the communism that they so loudly cry out and point at everyone else for. A total takeover of the government and sweeping federal power over every single American’s life.
boJiZb8Fb4M,Everyone needs to see 2025. 2025 is a sci fi script! Talk about wailing face plants.
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Project 2025 is a map to turn America in to North Korea, China, and Russia, only with extreme religious laws and to turn trump in to a king, if trump wins the election then Project 2025 starts and when it starts it will be the darkest days for America and it will last for decades."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump lies like a slithering snake. He is all up in Project 2025. And let's not forget the White Summer Boys. I am 70 years old and never ever have I seen a presidential situation as horrible as the one we are having to put up with now and for 3 more months.
boJiZb8Fb4M,Trump chose the republican party because he loves the poorly educated. 😂
boJiZb8Fb4M,"donald trump and his lies are so powerful, his cult followers believe he will live forever, die, then rise again in two days."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Republicans have always been a money grabbing party, they have no honor whatsoever, they converted in to the confederacy of the new era"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Well how can I say this, if the vast majority of Americans chose to stay home and not go out and vote to keep President Biden in the White House and Trump wins, then they will just have to live with the consequences."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Now that President Biden has all this newfound power from the SC imunity ruling, why can't he just extradite loser45, and all his goons to Russia where they could live happily ever after with their Commie dictator ? 😂🤣😋😚"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"💙⚒️🇨🇦🇺🇲⚒️💙
Still the
""UGLY American""
Vote BLUE 💙 
This November."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Good on Americans for getting informed!   Don't do what the Brits did by voting blindly for Brexit, and since then, regetting and suffering from the consequences of their brainless vote !"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Months! Oh baby, I have so much regret! I was going to start a podcast in 2019 on project 2025. This shit's been on my radar for so long. 😅"
boJiZb8Fb4M,"I was watching the Smithsonian channel and they had Air warriors on, they were talking about aircraft not politics. I heard this sentence NATO for the Taliban for 11 years, Trump let out 5000 Taliban. Dollars to donuts that is the deal he made to get out of NATO."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Ronald Reagan did implement quite a few points of project 2025. So did the bushes but 
nowhere near as many as trump. This ""blueprint"" was drawn up after Nixon lost to Kennedy. It really has been around a while. It's definitely been added to by trump and the RepubliCONS. Don't forget, the federalist society puts forth the federal judge candidate."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"This shows the American People are paying attention 🙄 

VOTE BLUE for democracy 💙 😎 and our freedoms 💙"
boJiZb8Fb4M,Why aren’t they talking about Trump’s association with Jeffrey Epstein?

They are getting rid of all the Federal employees and put THEIR   Loyalist in those jobs. Now it  is apparent why Trump said he would only be a Dictator for one day."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"""Civil Servants"" wake up & vote blue or lose your jobs & pensions!"

boJiZb8Fb4M,"81,000,000 American voters FIRED Trump in 2020, and we have not changed our minds since he became a Convicted Felon, Insurrectionist, and Adjudicated Rapist."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Damn right! I googled it and now I am posting the hell out of it!
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Trump is too completely stupid to put pen to paper for anything and he is exceptionally even more stupid to know he is a puppet for his *cough* dangerous allies who have nefarious intentions against Americans. Trump is a puppet, a moronic figure head being lead by the nose like a stupid bull to the slaughter oblivious to the evil that lurks in the Heritage foundation!"
boJiZb8Fb4M,Keep talking about project 2025 every day like everyone’s talking about President Biden’s  Age.
boJiZb8Fb4M,"Do those lines indicate that Taylor and Travis will marry next spring?

boJiZb8Fb4M,Thank you for keeping our attention on one of our greatest threats…Project 2025!
boJiZb8Fb4M,Unify under biden and let trump sink himself.  Seems to me the left is trying to lose this election by calling for biden to step down 24/7.  The democratic panic machine is pathetic.  Thank you for your logical coverage.

boJiZb8Fb4M,As it should!
boJiZb8Fb4M,At the end there you gave away that THE most disturbing thing that Americans aren't engaged 🤦‍♂. We Australians consider that as a consequence of NOT having compulsory voting that at least causes people to engage as against leaving things to the fringe.

boJiZb8Fb4M,The heritage foundation should be called the heretic demented foundation. Expecting that project 2025 will be good for our country not in a million years!
boJiZb8Fb4M,"I agree almost on everything , I am definitely against project 2025 however I am an independent who never voted for Trump nor will I ever… he was toxic from the moment he got sued and paid to keep people quite from his Trump university … with that said, I have only one disagreement… with what you and others are saying. I hear people calling project 2025 as the “conservative agenda” and while it’s permeating through the Republican Party as such… looking at project 2025 I argue that there is nothing “conservative” about it and rather anti-American"
boJiZb8Fb4M,MAGA loves being lied to and abused.

boJiZb8Fb4M,"There is a huge infrastructure developing to implement project 2025. Why would they need this infrastructure if they weren’t planning on using it? Obviously trump knows about it, and is anxious to have a government composed of nothing but yes men."
boJiZb8Fb4M,"The question is are they 'on board' with 2025 or not, that's what the world is watching🤷‍♂"
boJiZb8Fb4M,I don’t know why they’re panicking. They’ve been bragging about this. I think they thought Americans would like having their government destroyed and their rights taken away. 😂

Highly abnormal to build on federal land and put people on it then to deploy the national guard to keep order.
That sounds like internment camps to me.

No thank you trump.

I like my neighbor the way it is."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Mission accomplished

boJiZb8Fb4M,And why wasn't more made about Trumps interview with 'Time' magazine. Or has it been all too convenient to have been forgotten by mainstream media?

Also how George Clooney saying Biden needs to drop out. Lastly how that Dem. senator on  CNN said he believes we are going to lose the House, Senate and the Presidency."
boJiZb8Fb4M,Project 2025 Trump knows exactly what it is Trump the no good racist ass Republicans an judges an lawyer all need to be in prison

boJiZb8Fb4M,"Biden better drop out by the weekend if Dems want any chance. I still think Biden can win still but the damage is done. Maybe Harris is the choice but it better happen this weekend if not enough. The Dems problem is no one is able to attack the Republican BS. We need someone able to do that. The only two alternatives are Newsome, Major Pete maybe Hillary as someone said she is polling almost as good."

And that's a fact. 🇺🇲🙏👍😊
With President Donald Trump back in office  as Commander and Chief🌹"
g4Kv-S6sYQE,you did not 🚫👎🫸 even say 😭 on long ENOUGH to be called the News 🗞️ that was a joke
g4Kv-S6sYQE,"I can think of one individual who must be pleased:  Vladimir Putin.
Who has more to gain?  

Trump did not deserve to win; in the words of one former Republican presdiential candidate, Trump was running for office in order to stay out of jail.   A king or a Communist dictator could hardly ask for a better mandate to solve his own legal problems.

BUT, as usual, the Democrats have shot themselves in the foot through excessive confidence and
nauseating self-righteousness.

When Kamala Harris made it clear that an evangelical Christian was not welcome at her rally, 
she was begging for a rebuke from above.
If she can sit comfortably in a church pew one day, yet expose to public mockery someone who states the fundamental tenet of Christian faith ('JESUS IS LORD') on another day, what can one conclude?


Only  that this woman lacks integrity.  Telling people what they want to hear, one thing to one
group and another thing to another group, is NOT moral or even political leadership.
It may be standard Democratic strategy, but it is not leadership.

At least DT is consistent in his abominably racist and xenophobic messaging.
And Hillary Clinton's comment about 'deplorables' was a small thing compared to Harris' contempt for Christianity.
Harris ought to know that many followers of Lord Jesus are neither Republicans nor Democrats.
Where did she go to school?"
g4Kv-S6sYQE,😮
g4Kv-S6sYQE,Now hopefully the media will learn a lesson.  Media needs to report not propagandize the public with their bought and paid for scripted opinions.  Done with it.

Please can you read the new educational book called 'The Replacement People of the Bible', and see what the rabbis and priests have been hiding for thousands of years about Prophet Muhammad being prophesied in the Old Testament.

g4Kv-S6sYQE,i voted today 🇺🇸
AEhWtUxjoxQ,The African American person on this video is the most racist person I have heard in a long time.  There is no such thing as reverse discrimination there is only DISCRIMINATION MORON!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Nice to see Van talking for and down to the African-American women who he says have been talked down to.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Sorry  Kamala!!  but who loves Taylor Swift or Jenifer Lopez more than his kids ? We simply picked the common sense!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,CNN😢😢😢😢 never stop crying like a baby 😅😅😅😅
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Because of cnn I voted for trump
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Dana Bash comimg to the realization she's going to have to address JD Vance as Mr. Vice President in a couple of months 😂
AEhWtUxjoxQ,So much joy 😂🎉
AEhWtUxjoxQ,This is the best CNN show I’ve ever seen 😂
AEhWtUxjoxQ,fake news cnn deliberately delay the call to allow Dems to cheat as they did in 2020 but God was up to it and our vote was overwhelming. SHAME ON YOU!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"You guys were a little late maybe y’all should keep up with Fox News, NewsMax, & the Guardian News. Guess holding out hope for Harris didn’t work. All 3 of those stations called it way before y’all did! The numbers were there,"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,President Trump 🇺🇲 is the President Duterte 🇵🇭 of America 👊🏾💚💪🏾 GOOD FOR AMERICA ❤
AEhWtUxjoxQ,She is a hack
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I’m surprised that Van Jones didn’t say it was another white lash like he said in 2016.🤣
AEhWtUxjoxQ,This is hilarious the democrats are turning on each other.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"If Hollywood celebrities support something, you can guarantee that I will support the opposite."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,They are amost crying. Fake news media 🤣🤣🤣
AEhWtUxjoxQ,its so fun watching the CNN dousches squirm 😁😁
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Am i watching a funeral show?
AEhWtUxjoxQ,First guy is like “I voted for Harris because my gf told me too”…that’s the democratic part in a nutshell…
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Ahh this stuff is better than 2016. The popular vote cinches it and 312-226 electoral margin as of this writing
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Its like watching the moive Downfall
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Damn she was desperate to lay the claim that only uneducated people support trump and that level of arrogance is why they lost the working people
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Let be clear ,,, Biden administration was doing a political persecution to Donald Trump,, i am sure that 65% of the country knows that,  and another 15% thing the same but no want to believe,, is just the 20% that believe 100% that Trump is evil,,, and those 20% are the ones now cries about his victory"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"I love watching these CNN people eat their words, so delicious."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,People have had enough! I have had enough of being called racist because I'm a conservative. I have never heard a conservative republican threaten to leave their country if their candidate didn't win! What is wrong with people?
AEhWtUxjoxQ,God please tell me she wasn’t kidding about breaking up with that creep
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Thank goodness !!
CNN is full of idiots !!"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"CNN got a dose of reality of what the people came out to vote for, but they still won't get it."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van Jones is full of crap.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Van Jones ""people woke up with a dream and went to bed with a nightmare""  What the fucking hell do you think the last 3 and half years were?  Our economy is a nightmare!  Our border is a nightmare. In fact, YOU Van,  is a nightmare!!  Nov. 5th was when the people took back America!"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Jake Tapper wants you to believe Kamala still has a chance. CNN is fake news to the bitter end.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Knock it off Jones. Nobody's buying your sob story bs
AEhWtUxjoxQ,isnt that the media should report the news....but why do these people seem so crushed when their election has just produced a new president.????
AEhWtUxjoxQ,CNN 🤡 a lesson for life. Your lies and political leftist activism through a news organization does not work. Their faces are priceless.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I can’t find any good compilation meltdowns as the votes come in
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"It is not about  rejection , my black  brother( I am a black immigrant) but it is about the economy , I voted for Trump. People who came here illegally broke the law. It is not about feelings but follow the FACTS. For once, be non-partisan and be objective."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Lol bruh came mad close to getting dumped.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van Jones delivered an Oscar  worthy monolog.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van Jones (outlook)  is the reason why the election went the way it did.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Yes you guys need to come the center.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Without CNN and Swift and J-Lo and DeNiro, maybe Trump doesn't win."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,We in trouble if dey call in da Bobby bouche.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Pennsylvania was the brick that hit CNN. 😂🍾🥤🍟🍔🏹 USA 🇺🇸
AEhWtUxjoxQ,TRUMP ALSO WON THE MOST POPULAR VOTE. 👋💯❤️
AEhWtUxjoxQ,CNN still spreading their bullshit. Lol.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Don't forget Trump is a convicted felon and he is awaiting sentencing. This means that if the judge sentence him to prison her cannot be president!  I hope the judge do the right thing, but i fear he will cave to the mob."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"The republican made that young man wait 2 hours to vote!  They do that to all democrats hoping that they just go home. This is election interference. Republicans let republican vote without waiting. This is pure cheating. Trump cheated, he did not win. Not my president. Kamala is our real president."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,11:40 close? sir you must have the loosest definition of close on this planet to actualy believe what cnn said just then
AEhWtUxjoxQ,10 million missing voters
AEhWtUxjoxQ,These polls they are talking about are just nonsense. There’s no way that 41% of Americans approved of how Biden was running our country. Why would these so called news reporters continue spewing lies
AEhWtUxjoxQ,college degree in lesbian dance theory very important! so people with degree are smarter. yes
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Biden didn’t win Georgia in 2020 the election was rigged and everyone knows it. It’s really sad that the left will never admit the 2020 presidential election was stolen
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Cuck-a-doodle dooo Brian!!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,No Van Jones......... she wasn't seen as worthy.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,It's all Trump's fault. Just kidding.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,The news media was so out of touch with the people. They gas lit us into thinking Kamala was going to win. I didn't watch the news and went to bed not knowing who had won. Woke up the next morning ecstatically surprised.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,the COMMIE NEWS NETWORK ratings are trash!!  its over for brainwashing
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Ppl without papers will be scared? Does he know it's a crime to just enter the Country illegally?
AEhWtUxjoxQ,DJT is the BEST POTUS EVER 🇺🇲
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Male Hispanic voters wanted Trump.  That says it all.  Kamala was not the dems best choice.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,We have been lied to by the media.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Ha Van Jones is such a hack. Parents of “trans kids” are abusers
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"She should have won..

We need someone happy and joyful in charge 

If not..


Who is stopping to bring the best of the best of leaders of Earth??"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"The funny thing is they used the same lies they used in 2016 as if we wouldn't remember! In 2016 they said Trump would be a dictator, a fascist, a racist and a sexist...and he was NONE of those things during his 4 years, and they thought we'd forget how much better things were four years ago!!! Dems will never learn!!!!"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I’m actually pissed that the media painted women as so concerned with abortion that we’d throw out our country. We aren’t that stupid!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,That Trump won the popular vote is so key. They’d be whining like babies if he didn’t
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Suddenly I'm a cnn fan😅😅😅😅😅😅
AEhWtUxjoxQ,One of the greatest days in American history
AEhWtUxjoxQ,God bless USA and Trump
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"I hope you CNN and your likes will be professional again. You lost your plot to lie about TRUMP. I know you are pained, but you can't do anything about it. Americans and the world are well informed about your biases against it. Tell Democrats to come to middle left instead of far left😅"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van is racist!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van your an elite loser. You have no idea about average Americans and money!! So shut up and stop causing division!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van your an elite loser. You have no idea about average Americans and money!! So shut up and stop causing division!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Democrats flying over 20,000 illegals into our country is one huge reason they cannot be trusted to run America. 🇺🇸"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Too big to RIG!!🇺🇸🇺🇸
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I'm melting......................
AEhWtUxjoxQ,We rejected liberal talking points and liberal ideology. MAGA!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,The only time watching CNN was worth watching 😂
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Why was I 100% sure when asked he was gonna say he voted for harris.  Omg cnn is absolutely loathsome & they appear to have NOT learned a thing after being completely destroyed in the ballot box lmao
AEhWtUxjoxQ,EVIL THING WALKING
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Whenever they would bring up one of their favorite topics -- how uneducated and those without college degrees continue to vote the wrong way -- they must be talking about the likes of Robert DeNiro, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Lebron James, et al.  All people with no college degrees and in some cases probably even without a high school diploma."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Where did 11 million democrat voters from 2020 go? They never existed.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Boy, I've seen more cheerful faces at a funeral."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"cry CNN  cry,"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"This interview was funny as fuck,. this was the beginning of the end for Harris"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,They’re about to cry
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Utter bs, trump saw a major shift in university educated woman, black men, and hispanics, and also got better numbers with black women. People no longer believe MSM bullshit."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Ok we won’t now.  But we republicans need to now start to marketing are ideals to the 2026 voters
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"America will unify around our shared success. Plus, the sweeping win means that the literal majority is already excited about the future. America IS a great country and we have an even stronger future ahead TOGETHER!!🇺🇸❤️🙏🏽"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"WILL VAN JONES CRY AGAIN ??? 😢😢😢😢

AEhWtUxjoxQ,1:02 You should have stayed home and ate chips. 😢
AEhWtUxjoxQ,19:19 LMAO
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"It’s delicious! As the night went on, Dana Bash’s face became longer and longer 😂🤣😂"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Thank you media for all your vitriol, hate, and fear towards one candidate! You put him in the whitehouse when Kamala could have won! Shame on all of you smart political commentators your the smartest dumb people I know! You lost it for Kamala hope you’re happy!"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Lmao Kamala had to come back tommorow so she could spend all night crying and eating ice cream
AEhWtUxjoxQ,It’s funny how lefitst spend all day deep-throating CNN’s propaganda.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Trump
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"""Parents of trans kids""
Nonsense. Woke weirdos groom kids into becoming trans, nudging their decision making.
I didn't even know how much I liked women until I was 13.  I certainly didn't discuss my sexual identity w/ my parents. 
Boys put on hormones and puberty blockers will never achieve full size or functionality
The Left has lost their minds"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Funny how U.S never talk about woman for president...
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Hey Van Jones where was Harris and Biden for 4 years fir the black woman. You are a loser. America has spoken. You are an idiot.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I love Chris Walace weak answer as to why Trump is doing so well.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,That first moron who said he voted to keep his girlfriend.  Typical Democratic voter.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Harris was never ""one of their own"", Jones is such a phony shill."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,You guys are full of sh.. God Bless PRESIDENT TRUMP
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Anyone has the full thing?
AEhWtUxjoxQ,i hope Trump is allowed to wipe his stupid charges off of his record and then wipe his a$@ with the court documents!!! LETS GO AMERICA!!! Lets get back right! i have slept like a baby these past 2 days....❤❤❤
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Harvard Graduate here……I voted for Trump❤️
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Loved to see Dana Bash so salty
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Fon Jr. Stayed away from standing next to Baron Trump 😂😂😂, towering over Don Jr. 🤣🤣🤣"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,If anyone is really irritating me at CNN is Dana Bash..Why you are beating around the Bush..Trump won fare and square...
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Lol
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"I heard someone say, will Garbage take out the Garbage, help me out here. Who destroyed the economy?  I was in line to vote, it wasn't white men I heard saying these things."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Wallace lol
AEhWtUxjoxQ,America and the world needs Donald Trump
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Cry more Van Jones
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"WALLACE, YOU ARE A TRAITOR. I HOPE YOU ENJOY CNN 😀😀😀😀😀😀"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"I have never  seen this lady smile, nor anyone on CNN."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,😂
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Jake Tappy and Dana lookin so sad 😂
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Biden taught Gen Z and Millennials the misery of hyperinflation. Boomers tried to warn their children and grandchildren but all warnings were ignored, of Boomer’s Jimmy Carter’s economy. The good news is taxpayers will keep the $250/month tax cut Trump gave them in 2017 and seniors will save 6.5% tax cuts on social security. The young and old will have more spendable income because of Trump."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"We’re so SICK of the white women low educated voter comments. CNN needs to fire every racist on their staff starting with Audie Cornish. Fifty percent of white women are college educated. Trump’s election favored the man’s vote, who are SICK of being maligned as toxic."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Parents of trans kids 😂😂😂 would cnn just cop on
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"The meltdownsss😂😂😂😂😂
I cannot y'all"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,People are sick of how wacky the liberals are acting.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Alot of simps voted for Harris bexaus of thier wives/ gfs.... balls dropped off lol
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van Jones ( sure he has nightmare LOL) is hurt the most in America after Trump victory.  Come on man open your mind as an American not by your party and what only you believe in.  At least be gracious. CNN is always a left party and they need to change that. Laugh only when you win and cry and hate when you lose. Come on CNN take it do not be childish.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,blad white dude was dropping facts at 15 mins but then the black guy ruined it by playing the race card and thats why they lost
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Why do you keep saying the numbers of the polls!!!!!! Your polls have been wrong all the time even with all the bad press you could give Trump won by a landslide wasn't even close
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Biden admin won the election for Trump 🎉

Most orchestrated voter fraud in US History caused many to not vote and Trump still won"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Trump 48 hours not even in office 

1. Call with Putin to end Russia Ukraine war 
2. Cease fire in Iran
 3. Hamas calls for ""immediate end to war"" 
4. China hopes for peaceful coexistence with America 

Kamala Harris 4 years as VP
1.?"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Trump campaign denies and revokes journalists’ election night credentials after critical coverage
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Does Van Jones know anything other than race-baiting? People don't care if the president is white, Black, or Green or if they are a man or a woman. They care about someone who will put America first and not try to gaslight people into voting for a DEI candidate that has utter disdain for hardworking people who have been devastated by woke and detrimental liberal policies. Van Jones and others need to add a new tool to their toolbox, and that tool is called ""introspection"".

and fyi...  I am a black man."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"What God hs ordained has ordained. Cheers to your victory, Mr. Trump. God bless you and America at large 🙏 🙌 ❤️"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE ARE 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS. UNEDUCATED WOMEN AND MEN??? WHO ARE YOU?
AEhWtUxjoxQ,CNN kept Trump relevant after he left office.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Cnn is so emotional...cnn msnbc the view....grow up the man won life goes on
AEhWtUxjoxQ,My wallet doesn’t have a vagina.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,This was satisfying to watch 😂😂😂
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"I hope CNN will learn something about their tremendous mistakes in doing their “jobs”. Even if your channel is a propaganda media for democrats they lose elections in a landslide. It is time for self criticism, to apologize to the President and to come back to true journalism and no speculations. I hope Musk buys CNN"

AEhWtUxjoxQ,They keep putting women down and Hispanic men. Like we're dumb this is why they lost. Only they belive this crap.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,😂😂 the first guy !!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Where are now the 20 million votes you’re now lacking??
AEhWtUxjoxQ,This is my first time to watch cnn in 8 years and will also be last time! Love to see those darn faces. Cry more!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van Jones is a special kind of stupid
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"These CNN hosts always look like they are looking for a fight or something. They just always look miserable.  I don't know why anyone would get their news from them. Biased is not even the word, THEY FLAT OUT LIE. When I heard them twist Trumps words into a death threat for Liz Chaney, that did it for me. I do t understand how they can even get away with the crap they say. Anyway, hope they enjoy Trump the next 4 years and Vance the 8 years following that.....I KNOW I WILL!!!!!"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Christ from noble family
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Hahahahaha
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Van Jones. You are crying for the black woman who they think they do t belong.   Harris is black. Why didn’t she make them
Feel they belong in the past 4 years?  Sore losers. Trump won bc America was Tired of victims like you.  Are you giving 10k a month ron Alf people. ? You should. That is what 3 percent of your income. Help block people give them your money."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Brianna Keilar is absolutely beautiful and so are these election results! Go Trump!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Van Jones. !  That’s why Harris won.  Bc you played the victim card.  It was nothing about race or poor black people. They thought they were going to breath tomorrow. Are you kidding me. Black people. Hispanics like me, white. Yellow people elected Obama in2009 bc Obama didn’t play the victim card. He presented as a warrior , as 1a  doer. As someone that fought and rose.  Harris and you Van Jones playing. Oh poor black peoole. Trump presented as who he is ! A warrior. A support of the people. They tried to kill hin twice. But God saw and sees all the injustices and horrible things they called him hitler narcisissit etc etc. no!! God called him Preside t !!!"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I know they lost but dam the dems turned on the minorities so fast i was kinda baffled i didnt expect them to say all that da..
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"They left out the most important factor in this election. The one thing that will influence and dictate American votes, regardless of past tendencies or current trends - ""Taylor Swift endorsement""!!  Yes folks, forget ads, rallies, economy, immigration, taxes, crime rates, interest rates, jobs, or abortion rights. Once Taylor speaks, the people will follow. So, this election is decided and Trump should concede now, right ? Why isn't there a button to show that graph and the resulting effects. Not to mention all other wise and influential celebrities who have told us how to vote. Oh, and of course there's the ever-present media slant and social media control that mandates our actions. Where's THAT on the big board ??"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"CNN, the kingdom of fake news. Democratic party is a corrupted party."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Comerade Bidenov & Kamalla SWALLA Have Led us to NEW Heights of POVERTY AND DISPAIR! SCAM DEMIC MAIL IN FRAUDS! People REPLACEMENT Going Well! 🇨🇳 Carry On COMERADES 😊
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Van Jones is so wrong and Missouri is proof. MO had a ballot measure to legalize abortion, which passed, but Trump still won by a huge margin. Women are not a monolith who would all vote for bad policy over one issue. Further, those ""people without papers"" have been given free housing and money while ordinary Americans are suffering financially. Despite what the Democrat party clearly thinks, the US government is supposed to serve US citizens, not illegal aliens at the expense of US citizens."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Simp game is strong with this one
AEhWtUxjoxQ,CNN you suck 😂Trump /Vance 2024 ❤❤❤❤❤ ! Yeh baby ! All the way to the White House ❤I’m soooooooo Happy ! Thank you CNN for all your dishonesty and lias ! Keep your joy you know where lol 😝
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Always sweet to watch this…
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Eat it CNN, Hollyweird & the rest of you Commies."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"CNN, why don't you tell us all that you are part of the Democrat Party and hate the American people? Oh, that's right. You do every second of CNN's broadcasts. CNN is PROPAGANDA, and we REJECT you. You all are SNOBS, and we are tired of your lies. Do Not Expect us to be Polite and NOT Hold you all accountable because we will you can COUNT ON IT."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Telling you CNN is fake news, Democrats and there perverted child grooming belief system can now go back under the rock they slithered out of 😅"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,The one even remotely normal panelists telling them why they lost and they completely ignored him. ( dont know his name)
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Welcome back America 😊
AEhWtUxjoxQ,First dude simping harid
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Best compilation in a while. This was supposed to be funny right?
AEhWtUxjoxQ,make america great again
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I really thought potty-mouthed Cardi B's endorsement would have put Kamala in the White House.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I love to see the media cry!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I havent watched anything but msnbc nbc cnn etc since My man Trump got elected. Watching them blame everyone but themselves .its so fun when they cry😂😂😂😂
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"If you’re a parent of a trans kid

Wow

Must be billions of them"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Start seeing us! The “minority women” that know Trump is the best choice for America! Stop telling me YOU (the left) know what’s best for me! Trump!🎉🎉🎉
AEhWtUxjoxQ,And there she is Melania holding trumps little baby hands. What you recon else she was holding last night????????
AEhWtUxjoxQ,You said all the while it was all Trumps fault though..? What's that mean for  cnn's credibility and all your journalistic integrity???!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Now we know Democrats cheated and are still doing it. Harris won all the states with NO ID required.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Americans dodged a bullet. Harris would have brought on a great depression and WWIII.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Democrats are crushing the middle class and poor .. Harris would further destroy them. You people are STUPID.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Harris was a BAD candidate and had BAD polices.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I simply could never allow men to enter the bathrooms where my two precious young daughters go. In the end I had no optioned but to vote for Trump. I managed to convince all my family also. That was 16 votes. Let’s see what he does now. Sorry
AEhWtUxjoxQ,He has NEVER said he would go after his enemies…..another lie……he said he would have every right to
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"I absolutely love it that 13:52 , this guy lays out exactly why people are electing Trump, and it’s bc they don’t give af about bougie ideologies and being talked down to over it when they are struggling, and Van Jones, right on que, follows up with a dramatic spiel about women, POC and trans kid’s parents hurting tonight and “dreaming a big dream”…

Just glorious."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"What do you expect after everything they did to him, even tried to kill him, twice!!!"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,I did not know the ballet asked if people graduated.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,MIT Architect / structural engineer. I voted trump!!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"So Kamala has 13 million less votes than Biden did in 2020, makes you wonder, doesnt it? Did he really get 81 million votes?"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,we will never allow you to cheat as big as you did in 2020. We were onto you this time.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"Donald Trump announced on Friday that he would not attend the inauguration of Joe Biden on 20 January, after a violent mob of the president’s loyalists stormed the Capitol in an effort to overturn the result of the November election in an attack that left five people dead."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Harris was more unpopular than Biden.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,CNN is consists of awful human beings.  They are such rotten group people.  They they didn’t “call” the election till like 6:30 am.  They had him at 266.  Grow-up.  Alaska which could have been called 6 months ago put him at 269.  Planet earth called WI.  That right there was over 270.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,There is always going to be a huge hidden Trump vote when you’re arse holes to anybody who states they like Trump. How is that Not shocking.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,YOUR POLLS WERE NOT CORRECT...PLEASE LET US MOVE ON
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"J6. What a joke. Overblown BLM larp, nothing more. This is what you get from lying 24/7."
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van Jones can't see beyond his own thoughts. He is a closed minded bigot!
AEhWtUxjoxQ,America gave CNN and Democrats a huge middle finger. We are sick of the BS you have been serving up for years now.  Get with it and see that you all lie day after day.
AEhWtUxjoxQ,Van Jones is always so emotional 🤣
AEhWtUxjoxQ,What a bunch of butthurts! 🤣🤣
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"You're system has created this. You choose inequality. And, You choose right wing populism. Congratulations"
AEhWtUxjoxQ,"There's a lot of discussion about Biden's unpopularity being a burden on Harris, and WAY too little discussion about Harris' popularity, i.e. her performance in the Democrats' primaries in the past. You could just as well start a discussion about her being the right choice to be candidate or even back in 2020 to be VP. I think the Dems and the left-wing media were too eager to have a WOMAN OF COLOR running instead of someone actually competent and liked enough to convince the voters."
i8MCx25dRAI,"😂😂😂 the cope us delicious, especially coming from lonerbox"
i8MCx25dRAI,Hey you are trending for all the wrong reasons. The new way to fame is to rage bait genocide huh
i8MCx25dRAI,oof
i8MCx25dRAI,"Here is how to get saved and be right with God, who loved us all, for eternal life!
1-Realize that all have sinned before God, in one way or another.
Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) 
10. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:""
11.""There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.""
12.""They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.""
23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

2-Realize that God loved us, even as sinners enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, as a free gift to whosoever accepts it.

Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB) 
8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.""
9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.""
12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”

3-Confess unto God to ask to be forgiven of your sins, by accepting this freely given gift of forgiveness.

1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)
1.""Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.”
3.""For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;”
4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”
10.""For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.""
13.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.""And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:""
28.""So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

(An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.)
“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.
 I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. 
I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. 
I trust in him alone to save me. 
Nothing else. 
Not my good works or anything else. 
Only Jesus. 
I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”"

JhkskO-FtFk,Your analysis on any issue counts for nothing.
JhkskO-FtFk,Hassan is correct
JhkskO-FtFk,Please you need to stop referencing Wikipedia as a source of reference. High school kids know better than that.
JhkskO-FtFk,This is such an excellent piece!  Thank you.
JhkskO-FtFk,"another wikipedia reader pretends to be versed in history. typical defender of israeli genocide, a true destiny disciple"
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is deathly allergic to nuance
JhkskO-FtFk,acceptance of the gay stuff isn't the reason those countries are wealthy it's those countries are wealthy which makes room for more progressive ideas. wealth creates progressives not the opposite.
JhkskO-FtFk,Wild that being allied with America and being bombed by America are somehow both valid material condition related excuses to be homophobic
JhkskO-FtFk,Lebanese Destiny covinced me common sense still exists..
JhkskO-FtFk,Reddit psyop 🤡
JhkskO-FtFk,"To be fair, Hasan has good reason to be insecure about his intelligence."
JhkskO-FtFk,"""Houthis were stealing UN aid"" Holy shit they're just like Luffy from One Piece!!!"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Lonerbox is the best example of undeserved respect. He’s a collector of weaponized factoids in order to undermine the fight against mass suffering. INTENT MATTERS. It’s very unserious to do genocide denial on one hand and then try to discredit those who actually tell truth about it. Let’s say you’re correct that there’s more homophobia in oil states, as there is in any orthodox branches of any faith, as well as alt right gamer circles. The point is that the homophobia argument was used to defend the disgusting take that Palestian culture is inferior. What Lonerbox is great at is complicating truth to death. It’s this ultra-relativist liberalism that is the perfect climate for atrocity. It can go on for 76 years, as long as you keep it “complicated.”. Scratch a liberal and see a genocide denier bleed."
JhkskO-FtFk,You're a grifter and a Zionist
JhkskO-FtFk,"I love that Lonerbox is continuing to cultivate an anti Islamic audience, makes the grift make more sense 😂"
JhkskO-FtFk,"In Russia Chechnya is one of the most rich regions, but they are very homophobic. To the point of kidnapping and returning gay Chechens that fled to Russia. It is part of their culture and government politics. You can't really do anything about that, as they are backed by the feds. I respect their culture, but power dynamics in the region makes them be extreme in virtue signalling"
JhkskO-FtFk,"No offense bro, but you defend Israel I wouldn't take you seriously either."
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan complaining about LSF like they dont suck him off is hilarious
JhkskO-FtFk,What genocide?
JhkskO-FtFk,"You know what. I never really know much about you and only heard you tangentially mentioned through others, which wasn't always favourable so I never checked you out.

I am surprised, you seem very knowledgeable about the middle east (at least compared to most political people online, which isn't that impressive in itself but like... I am still pleasantly surprised) and your opinions  are pretty nuanced. 

You got a new sub. This was very insightful and also I like the way you talk. Very cool content"
JhkskO-FtFk,south america is pretty poor in meterial condition but argentina and Uruguay are pretty progressive when it comes to gay right and race stuff
JhkskO-FtFk,Hell yes dude! I fucking love defending western interests! Our culture IS superior to theirs.
JhkskO-FtFk,"The only think i would asmundgold is because he literally is an ignoranbt gamer, why i dont take that very serious,  the opposite, its damning and surprising on asmun that asmind bouught really good arguments earlier. And he actualy had a good apology and signs of growth.
Hasan didnt, as political bug influencer for, yeah. its his job, thats why hasan should be gone afte rinstead an ignorant but trying gaming  weirdo. Who has somehow a better political opinion than a political ex journalist?   

Yeah Hasan is a sain on the politic sphere. And actual has influence :("
JhkskO-FtFk,"I got to see Daniel Johnston live in 2007, Athens GA Popfest 👍👍👍👍👍"
JhkskO-FtFk,"""It's complicated"""
JhkskO-FtFk,You are defending genocide mate 🤡
JhkskO-FtFk,Because making videos about him makes you money.
JhkskO-FtFk,"Russia is factually homophobic enough to hunt gay people. And even in Ukraine, though those are like small groups of like 5 messed up people"
JhkskO-FtFk,"thanks for this video. i'm a yemeni israeli (my grandparents fled yemen in 1949). i have little knowledge of the country beside my grandparents' stories, so this is educational for me. it's insufferable that people like hasan have the gall to suggest that houthis are doing this out of some leftist anticolonialist tendencies and ignore the obvious antisemitism, child soldiers, obvious human rights violations, this year i've seen the left do all the stuff they used to hate- tokenizing, dogwhistling, erasure etc. and the amount of people on twitter who are stupid enough to suggest jews, christians and muslims lived together in harmony in yemen until 1948 is rage inducing."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan: ""
Yeah im brining on a Houthi rebel"" 
""He is not a houthi just a random Yemeni teenager""
""He is just like Anne Frank"" 
""He is just a poor yemeni kid"" 
WHY DO I HAVE TO DEFEND A RANDOM YEMENI KID."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Another issue with blaming ‘Western Imperialism’ is that you also have to blame Soviets as well because guess what? They were trying to influence the Middle East as well and were backing authoritarian regimes that oppressed minorities and other groups as well. 

‘Oh but they aren’t around anymore.’

They still caused a lot of damage, why is Afghanistan ruled over by a extreme fundamentalist regime? Because before America went into there, the Soviets tried establishing a puppet government in Afghanistan which resulted in all the issues it is facing right now. Simply blaming America isn’t going to solve anything but America was only bad and the Soviets were objectively the good guys! Who truly believed in liberating the working class while they were rolling tanks over striking workers and protestors."
JhkskO-FtFk,"It just seems to me that Hasan just cares more about his ego and clout than the actual issues, to the point where almost anything he says is maliciously ignorant. He’s a fundamentally unserious person."
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan has indirectly outed himself as a Nazi. He propagated and even celebrated a Nazi dog whistle through the Houthi music video while having previously stated that 1 Nazi at a 10 person table means it is a 10 nazi table.
JhkskO-FtFk,"Just look at Indonesia, my country btw. We halved poverty in the past 2 decades, our economy is stronger than ever but gay rights is still shit here. Hasan, ironically, is too Americanized to be able to understand that there's a lot more going on in other countries than what his WESTERN-CREATED communist philosophy would suggest. He can't think outside of his own LA socialist bubble."
JhkskO-FtFk,Blabber mouth. Rush/Limbaugh wannabe
JhkskO-FtFk,"When I watch Cenk’s nephew bad take videos online, or one of his radicalized Islamic terrorist propaganda and support videos, I have the exact same face on of discomfort, disgust, and shock as nmplol did when he was enthusiastically forced to watch terrorist propaganda recruitment videos, hijacking videos of innocent civilian cargo ships, and the kidnapping of civilian hostages live on Twitch at Cenk’s nephews multimillion dollar Beverly Hills California USA propaganda compound. Cenk’s nephew seems to try and project that it can onlyyyy possiblyyyyyy be a Destiny fan or Destiny orbiter that doesn’t also support these terrorist groups, and that everyone else thinks they are just as amazing as he thinks they are. But yea, nmplol is the universally recognized “Destiny fan” face of shock and disgust when watching this guy glaze Houthi pirates, or support Hamas and Hezbollah live on Twitch"
JhkskO-FtFk,As a gay person I was always on the hard left because I thought they were my allies but man looks I was very wrong about that.
JhkskO-FtFk,You're talking about bullshit that didn't do the thing. Like we dont have a super villain. However this is obviously a conglomerate
JhkskO-FtFk,"Lmao imagine just denying the Yemeni Genocide because ""lol houthis bad"" lol imagine comparing which genocide is better god you're a fucking retarded piece of shit"
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is neat dude
JhkskO-FtFk,Your framework is wrong. It doesn't incorporate media and our new Media as a standard
JhkskO-FtFk,Latin America is a complex Christo-Facist off-spring
JhkskO-FtFk,Wait a sec....youre saying cuz old Whites?
JhkskO-FtFk,Whoa whoa whoa....lets be clear....whites?
JhkskO-FtFk,The new Diablo is Agree with Asmongold
JhkskO-FtFk,Fishgills
JhkskO-FtFk,"""You're underestimating him"" - yeah, underestimating Hasan is bad, but let's also not overestimate him. Consider that a few minutes further into the segment bro malds about LSF and levies the mortal charge against it that this thing called Live Stream Fail posts only fail content and not non-fail content. The explanation that these things he says are actually 5D chess moves aimed at deranging the criticism seems way more of a reach than just ""it's his extreme narcissism acting up and steering him to believe or not and say or not certain things""."
JhkskO-FtFk,Daniel Johnston shirt spotted!!!
JhkskO-FtFk,"Well firstly hating hasan outside his sphere of influence does almost nothing to his fans. He smartly doesnt do adversarial collabs where he cant appear dominant.   If youre  just a twitch viewer who happened to stumble into hasans stuff through  friendly collabs you are almost always gonna stick with hasan fir political coverage  because he runs twitch pol. 


I get the idea behind calling him out but this is always gonna come off as antifan clout sharking  behavior from smaller creators like loner box.  


The only criticism that will change his rhetoric is critcism done on twitch by creators bigger than him , big creators outside of twitch on mainstream platforms or by his normie content friends. 
Thia is why ""  idiots  "" like asmon or ethan klein can get tons of stream coverage by him  while "" real debaters ""   dont even get twitter  replies
Nmplol can change more minds on twitch  than lonerbox. 


But if the goal is to make money and circle jerk with people outside of twitchpols influence  then more power to you. Get the bag"
JhkskO-FtFk,"you'd think with advancement in tech and science , others would be progress further towards better human rights but so far a lot of africa, asia and middle east have't moved much. Like imagine if China and India move forward especially if politically they had some change on the ground that is permanent"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hassan is a joke. Its a shame that those who veer left are drawn to him.. once they find out what a lolcow he is, it takes years to pull them from the alt-right."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Sorry to break it to you, but Islam as a religion was never advanced, nor was ever inclusive towards non muslims."
JhkskO-FtFk,"kinda telling how hasan's initial reaction is to try to discredit the argument on the pretext that it ""defends asmongold"". the man is allergic to engaging in good faith."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Sometimes when I watch the rage they have for one another, I wonder if Hasanstiny actually hooked up back in the day! 😂"
JhkskO-FtFk,"yeah Jews are typically the most critical of Islam (Houthi Little Red Book) and Christians because you people stole our culture, our God; and used our myths, legends, and texts against us for millennia. They stole everything from us, and hate us for being the ""little people in their book"". It breaks their brains that we're not fiction and their entire culture is a lie. People are fine, they're just people, it's the ideology and the infrastructure of organized Islam and Christianity that is disgusting."
JhkskO-FtFk,U are obsessed move on get a life ???like whattt live hasan alone😂
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan must have an IQ ~80.
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is so annoying because he really doesn't even want to be correct.. he doesn't seek to see what the morally righteous left position is. He just wants it his way or for it all to burn. And it's incredibly toxic because I bet a lot of his audience actually does want to be on the virtuous side of things since they're kids (and yes it's most definietly kids/young adults) who sought out left leaning politics.  But he is actually making them worse people by feeding them this fuckin nonsense and leading them too far left where you get incredibly reductive takes like america bad
JhkskO-FtFk,"so what did asmangold say? A 1:1 or less civilian to combatant death ratio, population growth of 20k plus a million other things just disqualify the Gaza war as being a genocide. Palestinians culture isnt good lol I think we can all just accept that pretty objectively quds TV having shows where kids talking about how much they hate Jews and having a martyrdom culture isn't good. Did he say something else?"
JhkskO-FtFk,If only he would actually talk to the people he critiques that are so openly welcome to speaking with him about their differences. It’s annoying how good he is at maintaining his own echo chamber.
JhkskO-FtFk,Twitter and twitch have blackpilled me so hard on I/P. You and D-man are truly doing gods work.
JhkskO-FtFk,They won't talk to you because you're like every other content creator at your scale and just seeking people with larger audiences who will engage with you regardless of pretense
JhkskO-FtFk,"Since Latin America came up, I just happened to meet someone from Brazil yesterday, and we don't get many people from that region in NZ so I haven't met many but he mentioned a lot about Bolsonaro and about corrupt government institutions generally and problems with fraudelent embezzling of public funds, environmental mismanagement, and he said Brazil could be an affluent super power, given the geography, the tourism, the resources, the lack of natural desasters that plague other countries like Japan and the US, yet cause the politics and institutions are malfunctioning the people aren't getting the standard of living they're entitled to, no mentions of ""CIA this and Western Capitalism that"" just honest healthy self criticism mixed with sensible patriotism. The way he talked about Brazil and the way Hasan talks about Turkey, Russia, Palestine, Iran, China any of his favourites, it's like night and day. Hasan projects his own narcissistic victim mindset and excuses onto entire nations 😂"
JhkskO-FtFk,Glad that you explain your thought process and are thinking about your thinking and critical of it.
JhkskO-FtFk,How long before Hasan popcorns into Cenk
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan seems to never want to dig into anything of substance, instead preferring to pander to his chat and deliver the most simplistic analysis followed by a bit of grandstanding. If he actually has any intellectual curiosity, he does a great job suppressing it."
JhkskO-FtFk,"I still dont see why Asmonds take was bad. No,  not all cultures are equal. Yes, I'm going to judge people who m*rder g ays, or even support doing so, differently than others. Yes, i will have less sympathy towards those people overall"
JhkskO-FtFk,Reading these comments feels like I found my people
JhkskO-FtFk,"Why cant hasan just admit the comparison was supposed to be in terms of ""kids who only know war"" and take the L on the mkspoken comparison?  He really is allergic to criticism..."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Any time Hasan receives criticism, he will claim it's character assassination. Literal narcissistic traits"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan: hahaha, why are people so mad bro, I'm only poisoning the mid of our youth, quit malding."
JhkskO-FtFk,Imagine Hasan trying to watch this on stream.
JhkskO-FtFk,"Thank you for the inspirational content, BonerBox.
You're like the Helen Keller of our generation! 🥲"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Remember how Saudi Arabia celebrated that women were allowed to drive alone just a few years ago? :D
Thats progressive for their culture....Women being allowed to drive a car on their own.....it seems ridiculous and so basic judging from a western standard of morals. I wouldnt say their culture is inferior but they have certain problems and got some catching up to do when it comes to human rights. 

Otherwise how could it have been possible that the football stadiums for the fifa cup were build by modern day slaves, lots of people perished building these structures in the hot desert sun...what western culture would allow for this today? They are throwing gay people from rooftops, they stone people, the incest rate is higher than in most other regions of the world etc. We could go on like this for days, naming countless issues in middle eastern cultures. 
Again their cultures arent inferior, they only got some issues."
JhkskO-FtFk,Oh shit! Clap them cheeks lonerbox!
JhkskO-FtFk,"9:40  I dont think Hasan only reduces ""social progression"" to to wealth and warfare. I think those were just the biggest ones that were affecting the regions he was talking about."
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan deserves anything and everything that comes his way. I hope he knows he should have his head on a swivel when doing his IRL streams....
JhkskO-FtFk,"Asmon was only wrong for saying ""Palestinians"" instead of ""Hamas"", since it's not exactly a democracy, and even then there would always be an opposing minority position making the generalization still wrong.

Also, 13:30 How can they say ""Netanyahu is bad for bringing suitcases of cash to Hamas to enable all this to happen"" but also defend Hamas?"
JhkskO-FtFk,"The problem people have is that the roles were reversed at one point.
During the Islamic golden age of science and culture advancing, we, the western world were going through the dark ages and it took us a thousand years to regain what religion took away from us.  The Islamic world took what Romans and other civilizations learned and developed them further, the rest of us suffered under our own sharia law, but a Christian version of it.

I am intelligent and honest enough to say, at that time the Muslim world was culturally better and also smarter than ""the west"".  I am not a child who will be blinded by religion keeping me from accepting reality.  I can accept at that point in history, we were ""inferior"" and ""offensive in all regards to middle-eastern values"".  I won't shout phobia to hide the truth.  

People need to learn history before they rush to a judgement on personal feelings.  And don't blame others for what you refuse to do on your own."
JhkskO-FtFk,"if maga had any political acumen, they would have pointed out that the DNC invited a terrorist sympathizer to their national convention."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Saw your IRGC and election take on Destiny's stream, As an Iranian I am amazed that someone not from my country has this much deep knowledge and correct take on it. Thank you very much for representing us how it actually is <3"
JhkskO-FtFk,Sure is interesting Hasan dislikes other Politics streamers that actually are doing research and looking at sources and not just shrieking stupidity at tweets and subreddits.
JhkskO-FtFk,Asmon was kinda right about the religion and the culture. He did deserve the ban about not caring about the Palestinians and basically saying they deserve it
JhkskO-FtFk,"The Houthi text - the amount of times the word Yahud is mentioned is telling. And I bet that a lot of western media would translate it as Israeli, to minimize the impact of what is being said. (even tho the text says ""Jew and his entity"", which clearly shows they are capable of differentiating a Jew from Israeli). BBC, I believe, was caught with these mistranslations in their documentary on Palestinian kids."
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is not a political streamer. Hes a clown that has political views. Thats not the same
JhkskO-FtFk,"Based Lonerbox, Based Dylan Burns and Based Rashad Krenshaw all calling out Kremlinabi around the same time, he's cowering in his tankie bunker just like when Stalin cowered behind the door that was too thick for anyone to save him from that heart attack"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan is so incredibly bigoted yet his fanbase tries to gaslight people into thinking that he is a voice of reason. I hate Hasan even more than I hate the average neo-N*zi because at least they are honest about their hatred. Bigots like him are much more sinister because they appeal to the masses and are easier to give the benefit of the doubt, in my opinion."
JhkskO-FtFk,12:00
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is nepo baby of his cringe uncle cenk 🤮🤮
JhkskO-FtFk,I hate hasan. But you kind of look like a multiverse version of him😅
JhkskO-FtFk,"Wait, does Loner (or any of you) think Gaza is a g cide?"
JhkskO-FtFk,you fucking stole my youtube title fuck you lonerbox
JhkskO-FtFk,"never change LB. Even though your content is dense and probably time intenstive, It is amazing work that you do"
JhkskO-FtFk,"“Bro, ‘death to juice’ doesn’t literally mean ‘death to juice’, bro.”
-Hasan"
JhkskO-FtFk,I hope loner covers the Ethan thing the amount of gaslighting in his fan base makes me wanna throw up
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan can have the worst takes it doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that Twitch won't allow any significant opposition to him and his cronies. Hasan successfully provides a narrative, so anyone opposing him is looked as evil or the worst person ever along with a ban, and this is a problem for Twitch, or will be."
JhkskO-FtFk,"The desire of Marxian thinkers to boil everything down to property (i.e. material conditions) has been its biggest criticism *since* Marx was alive. Real sociology chads embrace Weber's Power, Property, and Prestige model."
JhkskO-FtFk,the people defending the houthis are the same people who think your entire life should be over if you tweeted something problematic when you were 14
JhkskO-FtFk,"Why would you ever question Hasan's expertise about Yemen? After all, he has read _several_ X threads on the subject.
Also, everything after 20:40 has been eloquently summarized by an another online Yemen expert commentator; ""the Houthis are correct"".
/s"
JhkskO-FtFk,"The Iran ""trans rights"" glazing fucking threw me for a loop when Hasan said Iran has better trans rights than America, because they have forced operations. First of all, if you're forcing an operation that's not a trans right, asshole. That's forced. Secondly, they force gay people. The choice for gay people is transition or die. What rights, Hasan? What fucking rights?"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Yeah you’re right dude, you can look at a graph and a map and then reach these conclusions; I guess we can just pack up sociology and anthropology now that we have STATISTICS"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Yeah you’re right dude, you can look at a graph and a map and then reach these conclusions; I guess we can just pack up sociology and anthropology now that we have STATISTICS"
JhkskO-FtFk,"I'm obsessed too. But hey, give it a couple of months, Anna Kasparian is on her way to rich dumb pretty people gifting ville, for us to obsess over her idiocy as well."
JhkskO-FtFk,LonerBox is just Destiny 3.0. Just another in a long line of models.
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan is a joke, he is a frequent liar and fraud, a terrible socialist amd frankly a coward. If the US fell to infighting with fascists on the streets, Hasan would absolutely run away to Turkey, with his millions, stolen millions from his content theft. Abandon the left to die to fadcists...Hasan has singlehandedly turned the US left into a joke. That every online leftist has to lick and pay lipservice to this clown is embarrassing."
JhkskO-FtFk,watching hasan just make shit up and get mad at it is so frustrating this is shit that qanon people do
JhkskO-FtFk,I hope he just opens up completely and people finally realise the kind of person he is. He's not a good guy who just gets something wrong sometimes.
JhkskO-FtFk,I enjoy hate watching Hasan but I can’t justify giving him any views. So I appreciate videos like this
JhkskO-FtFk,And I’ve changed my mind. If they’re gonna let Hasan deny that there’s a problem with homophobia in the Middle East then Asmon shouldn’t have been banned.
JhkskO-FtFk,i love the history streams keep it up hope to see more coverage on Israel/Lebanon/Iran on the channel
JhkskO-FtFk,hasan is scared of people that read wiki pages
JhkskO-FtFk,I can't get over the Anne Frank comment
JhkskO-FtFk,"I imagine that Hasan couldve become a good political figure if his downright fascistic takes wasnt rewarded with the biggest payout on twitch and a protected citizen status in it.
I dont care about him anymore. They enabled him. Now its their problem."
JhkskO-FtFk,"With a lot of pro Israelis and pro Palestinians you need to toe the line on every single topic that they believe in. If you don't they won't consider you pro Israel or pro Palestine they'll treat you like you're just as much of am enemy as the people that simply want mass killings. It really makes me think they don't want allies or support, they want servitude."
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan has admitted he likes LBs takes on Israel in his pre-prepared content. Why not have him on stream?
JhkskO-FtFk,Its important that people like you speak out on these things that Hasan says. Unfortunately Hasan is super popular with very young audience that only get their political information from Hasan.
JhkskO-FtFk,"If the Houthi Kid is “Anne Frank”, then most of Israel are “Anne Franks”. Many people who call it home actually survived the Caust or their children live there."
JhkskO-FtFk,Does Anne Frank watch one piece though?
JhkskO-FtFk,"""Im homophobic bc im poor from american bombs."" Hasan analysis probably"
JhkskO-FtFk,"If Asmon gets banned, Hasan should get perma banned"
JhkskO-FtFk,45:10 My sister’s partner is of Iranian Ba’hai descent so I can indeed confirm this to be true from my understanding based on conversations I’ve had with her and her family.
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan's anti USA rhetoric is just a lazy way to pin anything and everything onto a boogieman.  Its so easy to sell once you have a brain rotted audience, and its brain dead easy to always draw the line to the US via foreign policy or some nebulous geopolitical claim."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan seems completely unable to think for himself, every take I've ever seen him give is just parroting whatever is the twitter leftist consensus or something other commentators have said, every talking point he uses for evidence you can tell he got from somewhere else (probably why he's not a great debater if his opponent veers off course). But I guess it's not that surprising that the leftist figure who becomes the most popular online is just the one that's an amalgam of every leftist online, good and bad."
JhkskO-FtFk,"Fun fact - the Bahai World Center is located in northern Israel, after the Ottomans exiled and imprisoned the religion's founder in Acre. Though the majority of the Bahai fled Israel on the eve of the 1948 war, a community remained to found the aforementioned institution under Israel's freedom of religion and is still residing in and around mount Carmel in Haifa."
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan covers Ben Shapiro because he's a prominent right-wing figure and people rightfully don't think there's an obsession. Hasan and his fans cannot keep claiming that covering Hasan makes someone obsessed
JhkskO-FtFk,You are a falangist
JhkskO-FtFk,"Because Tankies are not an insignificant number of people and Hasan is a Tankie that best exemplifies the Tankie mindset. 

Can we please yeet those Fascistic MLs back to the USSR days"
JhkskO-FtFk,"To quote Marx: ""All I know is that I am not a Marxist."" Engels: In general, the word ""materialistic"" serves [...] as a mere phrase with which anything and everything is labelled without further study, that is, they stick to this label and then consider the question disposed of. But our conception of history is above all a guide to study, not a lever for construction ... the conditions of existence [regarding] the different formations of society must be examined individually before the attempt is made to deduce them from the political, civil law, aesthetic, philosophic, religious, etc., views corresponding to them.""
It's gauche, but the NYT just wrote a piece on how important live-streamers, Hasan in particular, have become in terms of political advocacy and activism, Palestinians don't need more of this neo-Nasserite bullshit."
JhkskO-FtFk,not like destiny is any better
JhkskO-FtFk,6:48  Islamic doctrine is a very big cause though of the anti science and human rights in muslim countries
JhkskO-FtFk,Does he ever actually address any of the points he’s being criticized for making Or does he just tap dance around every criticism every time? Pretty scary and frustrating having the biggest “political streamer” on a platform be so brain dead and unwilling to engage in any criticism of his opinions.
JhkskO-FtFk,Because you’re a DGG member now 😂❤
JhkskO-FtFk,"I feel like with an above average history knowledge, Asmon statements are true but crass, Shari'a law as a govt policy lets anti LBGT and minorities abuses happen, That makes your culture lesser, Hamas is the culture of Gazan Palestinians, Palestinians arent a culture in gaza its sad but since Hamas cemented there grip post 2005. Like Palestinians Painted over Jarrar's Rainbow artwork in hours 5 section of wall were too Gay for Gaza. If you need morality police force like Hamas Hezb. and SA and iran your culture aint it chief."
JhkskO-FtFk,dear aslan
JhkskO-FtFk,Cant really expect Hassan to do any sort of research xD
JhkskO-FtFk,"Ive loved you loner, like no joke you’re the only one who can criticize these people from the left. That’s why they won’t talk to you."
JhkskO-FtFk,you're obsessed with him because it makes you money. a majority of your top-performing videos are attacking other leftists. I am willing to bet that this video will massively outperform your last video in which you criticized Israeli right-wingers. that's just the audience you cultivated and you recognize that
JhkskO-FtFk,"I cannot imagine how frustrating it is to have a larger content creator in the same space make ridiculous wrong generalisations about you based on a random chatters comment without even WATCHING THE VIDEO

His legions of psychotic keyboard warriors now believe that loner was defending asmongod when he was doing the OPPOSITE

What a fucking idiot omg"
JhkskO-FtFk,"This war has put my lefty brain in a spiral. Like i dont like Israel but like the way the left went full blown p
Propalestian to the point denying the atrocities that happened in oct 7. Its a mindfuck."
JhkskO-FtFk,Battle of the Broccolis
JhkskO-FtFk,Loner wants that Gucci bag too.
JhkskO-FtFk,Tldr: Money $$$
JhkskO-FtFk,The amount of sleep I’ve lost over gen z taking hasan seriously as a thinker over the past 5 years would be a truly shocking number of hours once tallied up
JhkskO-FtFk,How much wealth do you need to not kill gay people anyway? Does that cost money? If anything I’d imagine if you’re fighting for survival hating gay people just takes away valuable energy.
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is much more calculated than I previously thought. It's fucked up how he still has a twitch channel.
JhkskO-FtFk,Lmao first time I come to this channel and dude looks like a Temu Hasan
JhkskO-FtFk,"I disagree with Loner here, and of course with Hasan as well, but yes, it is Islam. Islam isnt anything genetic. It's an ideology which shapes the world view of billions of people on this planet, including for example their view on LGBT and women.

there is nothing magical about arabs or other muslims. they can have just as many bad ideas as anyone else. 

There was nothing magical about the germans either, Fascism and Nazism are just shit world views which makes people do bad stuff. and if you think about it, they are just extreme extensions of patriotism and nationalism. just as when crazy muslims do crazy shit while some dont its because they have levels of adherence to their crazy believes.

but one very important difference is that if Islam was actually correct about the universe, god damn yes do you have to adhere to its values because the fate of hell is so horrible that you want to avoid it at all costs.

that is what makes religion so uniquely dangerous even in comparison to fascism or other crazy political views"
JhkskO-FtFk,Damn audience capture really breaks a mf
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan and his echo chamber followers are just the opposite side of MAGA
JhkskO-FtFk,Bro says materialism is reductive and then proceeds to cite all the material aspects which would mold a culture to a given form. I fon't know who's braindead here.
JhkskO-FtFk,"Even without being particularly pro Israel, its impossible to deny that the fixation on Israel in many ways is a form of denial of the real big problems of the Arab world."
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is just a clown now. He used to be all for the democrats  winning. But once he found out Tim Pool was getting that bag hes started glazing Chump and dawging Kamala.....EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THE ONE WHO WANTED KAMALA TO TAKE HIS PLACE!!!!
JhkskO-FtFk,5:03 why did you go on a minute long ramble about the material conditions of Islamic countries and then say it’s not about the material conditions?
JhkskO-FtFk,~20:00 Abridged History of Yemen
JhkskO-FtFk,He has only bad takes.
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is combining a strawman with a red herring.  it seems like these people on the edge who don't understand nuance often do this
JhkskO-FtFk,"Hasan is a hell of a lot smarter than he looks...
and yet somehow still not that bright. Hard to do!"
JhkskO-FtFk,"Why should we bother to reply to Lonerbox? He would reply to us, and we would have to reply to his reply. There’s no end to that. It will be quite enough for us to announce that Lonerbox is a traitor to the working class, and everyone will understand everything."
JhkskO-FtFk,Def sounds like both you and hasan are talking to strawmen :/
JhkskO-FtFk,"Mentioning true facts is pro-genocide, obviously"
JhkskO-FtFk,4:50 also know as material conditions
JhkskO-FtFk,"I love Hasan, he makes me feel intelligent"
JhkskO-FtFk,Answer: he's obsessed with Hasan takes for easy views and in hopes of getting Hasan to engage with him for access to his audience.
JhkskO-FtFk,Hasan is a very influential public figure unfortunately
JhkskO-FtFk,"I remember a year ago when Loner was happy that hasan had a positive opinion of him and wasn't as anti-hasan as he is now. Glad that this arc has ended and we can call Hasan and his takes what they are - ""sht for brains takes"""
JhkskO-FtFk,A hyperbolic and reductionist take? From Hasan? Color me shocked.
JhkskO-FtFk,You also need to look at Reagan funding extremist Islamic groups in the 1980s because he feared secular middle eastern politicians were too sympathetic to communism and thought these groups would be easy for the US to manipulate
JhkskO-FtFk,talk WHEN
JhkskO-FtFk,"Its very important to call Hasan out for some of his takes.

He basically has a strangelhold on Twitch politics and gets away with things no one else would because clear favoritism towards him and his views by Twicth management."
JhkskO-FtFk,nice title. he wont be able to resist watching on stream. KEKL Pepela D OMEGALUL. hasan plz unban me
JhkskO-FtFk,"cenk's nephew is unhinged 
:-)"
JhkskO-FtFk,finally some good f*cking food
JhkskO-FtFk,Hassan gets me emotionally upset. The biggest reason is that his arguments/manipulation tools are so transparent and easy to spot yet still work.
JhkskO-FtFk,"He is the most popular political figure in the world at least among gen Z.   What he says matters. 

Leftist took what Qanon said serious, Hasan has way more influence then Qanon"
JhkskO-FtFk,You just know it’s gonna be a banger
JhkskO-FtFk,Im sure if you asked hasan piker about october 7th violence against the Israelis im sure you'd find similar levels of ambivalence as asmongold has for the palestinians.
JhkskO-FtFk,Based
JhkskO-FtFk,Flirst!!!
JhkskO-FtFk,45 seconds no views bro fell off
MhwoigsS4A8,I'll pin this comment and post my superchat responses below as I get to the ones I didn't address on the stream.
MhwoigsS4A8,"You didn’t vote for president? Shameful. It’s always the self proclaimed intellectuals who think they are too good to vote for someone. You think you’re holier than thou by doing that. You should have put your pride aside and picked the lesser of two evils (the guy who doesn’t advocate for censorship). Not voting is the least American thing you could have done, especially this election when our country was threatened by a group of extremists who flew in illegals to swing states in hope of creating a one-party power."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Hello, are you planning to do a post-election video to give your thoughts on the outcome and discuss what you were correct about and what you were incorrect about?"
MhwoigsS4A8,"I think it's wrong of JD Vance to talk about childless cat ladies, because Victoria Nuland has children."
MhwoigsS4A8,"""I'm not sure he's going to win Michigan idk why he's going there so much""

That aged like milk."
MhwoigsS4A8,"1:20:00

Agreed on all points. We are friends, neighbors, brothers in arms and in peace.

I may not like what my brothers say, but I will defend their right to say it with all I have.

Disagreement does not have to mean blood enemies."
MhwoigsS4A8,Anyone else here after?
MhwoigsS4A8,"Decades ago my high school civics teacher said most people are too dumb to vote. At the time I thought it was elitist, but he was right. 

The country fully deserves what is about to happen."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Pastor Chris. One side will destroy everything America stands for to have abortions. As a born again Christian, as I was saved last year, God showed me His heart on abortion and war. Although I think we are normally called to be members in the kingdom of Christ and forsake nationalism, we are also accountable for the society we live in. The DNC convention had a mobile abortion clinic there. Also, we are not out of the woods, God's judgement is still coming for New Babylon. Trump and Republicans are not perfect, but it might by us time to spread the light, because everyday our power is on, we have food, and we have peace, is still a blessing from God."
MhwoigsS4A8,1:03:21 - 538 was correct - it was precisely 312R - 226D
MhwoigsS4A8,1:03:41 👀
MhwoigsS4A8,We win these boys
MhwoigsS4A8,Trump did a Cleveland.
MhwoigsS4A8,Here after the fact. It was a landslide!
MhwoigsS4A8,"It’s funny watching this in hindsight, idk why he seemed so sure Sherrod Brown would win (lost by a decent margin), and why he thought it was very likely Trump would lose Wisconsin & Michigan. Trump was down by less than a point in average polling and in past elections he would outperform the polls by at least 2%. Also Harris’s 4 stops in Pennsylvania shows desperation, not a sign of confidence"
MhwoigsS4A8,1:03:54 bingo 😆
MhwoigsS4A8,"Love your videos.  Never miss one.  The best possible outcome:  Donald Trump is our new President, Republicans took the Senate, and are on the way to taking the House!!"
MhwoigsS4A8,"Real question. Why do people say the gop has become super extremist. I feel like as a moderate I see the republicans have been pretty consistent in their views, and I feel like this statement is a lot like people claiming that 1940s Germany was ultra right wing or ultra left wing without taking into consideration the actual real life fact that it was just completely different. I understand that this comparison isn’t the same but I feel like people just say the republicans have become super extremists and I just don’t see how other than how they convey their message, they are saying the same things that they have always said, so I am honestly just asking a serious question about this not trying to be all against the left because I do still support a lot of what the left supports. Thank you for your videos I’ve been watching since the first time you reacted to oversimplified with the first civil war reaction you did and I have really enjoyed learning more about history!!"
MhwoigsS4A8,"As we look for harbingers to come, I think a misogynist, convicted felon, convicted sexual abuser, liar, will win. Go figure, America is deluded."
MhwoigsS4A8,"You were fairly accurate better than most but if you only knew how inaccurate that NY Times/Siena poll was you likely would have been 100%, that poll turned out to be an outlier. I thought Michigan would go to Trump all along myself."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Well, Donald trump’s victory is historic. Congress is majority republican. He got the popular vote. And won all swing states. He’s now the second non consecutive president in the United States. Greatest political comeback in American history given the challenges he faced"
MhwoigsS4A8,"Thank you, America, for voting for stability. With the previous admin, the world was looking like an extremely scary place. Men allowed to become women, DEI hiring and firing in the workplace, the skyrocketing price of oil and energy; not to mention the debacle in Afghanistan, the invasion of Ukraine, the invasion of Israel, and the threat of invasion of Taiwan. I'm relieved that you've not allowed the previous admin that oversaw these disasters and threats to remain in power. And to those whose egos are injured by Trump, whom many of you call brash, rude, belligerent, an a**hole - that's what the rest of the world thinks of you americans anyways. At least now there's a leader who will curb the insanity in your country and will scare the real bullies (China and Russia) enough to keep them contained to theirs. 
May God bless Trump, 
God bless the US, the world, 
and may God bless Fiji."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I’ve actually come to the realization that the average citizen cares absolutely nothing about this country, our perception amongst our allies or our concept of laws, morality and faith.  There is no cure for stupidity…period!!  🇺🇸🥺"
MhwoigsS4A8,"1:03:22, 538 was right (assuming NV/AZ don't flip)"
MhwoigsS4A8,"It seemed to me pretty early on that Sherrod Brown was going to lose on election night. Especially when he was barely ahead while Trump was up by 4. My experience with Ohio reporting skews on election night is that it tends to get very Republican between 30% and 80% reporting and then at the every end steps back a bit towards the Democrats. Brown did improve substantially relative to Harris, but he could not survive that double digit Trump win and he got swamped. 

I also noticed in Indiana that Banks was outrunning Trump in the suburbs, and this led me to believe that might be the start of a trend, though it faded as returns came in and Trump ended up leading the ticket in most instances, rather than the other way around. Even so, it was my first indicator that Brown was in trouble."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I think if Shapiro was the VP, she wins PA. But would she win WI, MI, NV and AZ? I don't think so."
MhwoigsS4A8,1:03:25 The simulator got it right on what it though was the most likely outcome!
MhwoigsS4A8,You were more accurate then several of the election channels I followed!
MhwoigsS4A8,Trump 2024 LETS GOOOO!
MhwoigsS4A8,You got the winner right but the states wrong blue wall never breaks
MhwoigsS4A8,I really wonder why you are a backer of the electoral college but you said the election comes down to like 4 states so basically nobody else votes from any other state matter…. so could you give a small explanation how 3-4 states having the whole election in their hands how is the right way to do an election? Trump would’ve still won if it was just the popular vote because ALL Americans spoke not just 3 states
MhwoigsS4A8,"there's something inside me that died when I saw trump win. Trump plays to an older audience that thinks in an old fashioned way, but I feel equally old fashioned in that I found his candor and smugness just awful. It was just so hard to see someone act so brutally barbaric and unrefined take control of the world's wealthiest country. That's politics. If playing a city building video game, you just make the most profitable and advanced society. Politics doesn't enter the picture, only science and results. I wish real life were so simple."
MhwoigsS4A8,That simulation thing you showed was kind of incredible how spot on it was it’s most predicted simulated finish is more than likely gonna be exactly how it ends
MhwoigsS4A8,Back to see the results. Pretty accurate.
MhwoigsS4A8,"Trump wins both the election, but also the popular vote by a landslide."
MhwoigsS4A8,So glad you were elected.
MhwoigsS4A8,You just missed Wisconsin and Michigan
MhwoigsS4A8,I got to hand it to you. You nailed it.
MhwoigsS4A8,You didn’t have a sense? I’ve never felt more sure of what was going to happen in an election in my life
MhwoigsS4A8,I was gonna shout wrong but you listed arguments and reasons for your prediction
MhwoigsS4A8,"Atleast it wasn't a victory close enough for either side that it could cause a scandal and violence, I think Republicans may be able to get a lot done this term."
MhwoigsS4A8,312-226 is just about right.
MhwoigsS4A8,Landslide. Wasn't even close.
MhwoigsS4A8,Can we get a post election review Chris? Where you review your predictions and what you got wrong and what you got right?
MhwoigsS4A8,Appalling that you are so informed about history & politics but aren't voting for either candidate?! Anything else is just throwing your vote away smh.
MhwoigsS4A8,Polymarket pretty much nailed it across the board...they have taken over as the go to vs pollsters.
MhwoigsS4A8,"Thankfully, it ended up an electoral landslide and a popular vote win for Trump!"
MhwoigsS4A8,Harris didnt make speech to conceded
MhwoigsS4A8,"A great result, not only for the country but for the rest of the world as well!

Respect and gratitude from Germny.
IMO good trumped over *vil and we are all better off for it."
MhwoigsS4A8,Don't worry we won
MhwoigsS4A8,"1:33:57 i genuinely really need to keep this in mind because that place genuinely can brainwash you into believing it's actually the reality that exists

(not to discredit what *did* happened, but on the grand scheme of things it's not happened like everyday in a close proximity)"
MhwoigsS4A8,"I watched live but it's currently Wednesday evening in Australia (so, like 4am for you) and he's still sitting on 266/267 (depending on source) but it's all but guaranteed. (and likely to get WI and MI)

I can't wait to see the follow up with where your predictions hit or missed.. and some discussion on why polling seems to be so inaccurate these days.

Also, give my condolences to your daughter, she's got a life time of elections to come and we all take turns having our voices heard more clearly. (though on this note, are you expecting much dispute in your upcoming holiday gatherings or does your family do well at remaining civil?)"
MhwoigsS4A8,So here after the election Trump wine every swing state and won the popular vote by 5 million.
MhwoigsS4A8,Well Ukraine you have got 2 months after that I hope Europe assumed the worst and are prepared to take over full support..
MhwoigsS4A8,"I thought that the Millitary Industrial Media Complex's Team were in trouble, when they started claiming that it was ""Neck and Neck"" and that Trump was the ememy of all that is Holy. But when I saw Stormy Daniels on the panel of ""Expert Commentators"" I knew they were F***'d."
MhwoigsS4A8,TRUMP WON WOOHOO
MhwoigsS4A8,"Oh man I missed the event, sorry thought it was an all night thing!!!"
MhwoigsS4A8,That’s wack I got like 200k people in my area and I waited like 15 minutes to get in to vote
MhwoigsS4A8,I’m happy to see someone support both parties 😊
MhwoigsS4A8,I voted but I left president blank.
MhwoigsS4A8,Are we having a podcast today?
MhwoigsS4A8,Voting days after Diwali 🪔🪔🪔.... SHRI KAMALA DEVI is in control 🙏🌒🌺🪔🕉️
MhwoigsS4A8,Really love and appreciate you and this channel but not voting for president is kinda crazy
MhwoigsS4A8,"Harris would've lost every single muslim and student-aged vote, if she'd gone with Shapiro, as her stance on the Israel-conflcit is bad enough as is and Shapiro would've made it that much worse. Walz at least managed to give her campaign some much needed energy and flippancy, mobilizing and motivating people."
MhwoigsS4A8,Trump is running as a moderate.  He is basically running as Bill Clinton from the 90's
MhwoigsS4A8,"I'll try to avoid saying anything too inflammatory (an impossible task considering the subject matter) out of respect for you and the amazing culture you've cultivated on this channel, but man is it scary seeing how many of the superchats were confidently stating their decision to vote for Trump. I understand there's an incredibly large cultural divide in this country right now that makes it difficult for people to vote outside of their parties, but I feel like Trump's attempts at undermining the foundational institutions of this country should, at the very least, make people a bit hesitant to vote for him. 

There's something incredibly sobering about the fact that so many people refuse to believe that the 2020 election was fair despite the numerous lawsuits against people and organizations spreading misinformation, the countless lawsuits filed by Trump and his team that were thrown out for lack of evidence and/or standing, the co-conspirators that PLED GUILTY to the crimes they were charged with, and last but absolutely not least, the indictments with mountains of evidence where Trump's only defense was ""I acted as the President so I can't be charged"". 

With that aside, I appreciate your insight into this election and I will join you in praying for the success of the next president, regardless of who that may be."
MhwoigsS4A8,I'm an iowan and iowa is definitely gonna be red I'll put money on it. My family is very blue and they are MAD that I'm choosing not to vote. I see problems on both sides and I just don't want to be involved. I'm very much independent and I can always argue both sides of many arguments.
MhwoigsS4A8,"Resident Alaskan here. I think you'll be surprised by the House race. Although historically we've been very red, there's been a pretty big liberal shift over the past decade or so in Anchorage, which is by far the most populated city in Alaska. I've also noted a pretty big moderate movement in the state, I think due to many variables but recently because of big republican failures on the mayoral and governor levels that have caused a large distrust. Peltola is very moderate, I saw another comment note that she is the rare anti-gun control democrat, and most of her other policies are all very pro-Alaska, which is a huge deal to most of the population up here, especially because of all the native villages that rely solely on fishing and hunting industries to survive. Begich comes from a political family that have always been very left leaning and untrustworthy, and I think Peltola pretty easily appeals to the majority. Clearly I have some bias here tho cause I do support Peltola"
MhwoigsS4A8,"I used to be a huge fan. But Chris claims to be a pastor yet refuses to vote against abortion, comes out as pro-gay marriage and pro-marijuana, and advocates for rank-choice voting??? Respect for his history knowledge aside, I cannot trust Chris’s judgment because if he had any principles, they have since been diluted or washed away entirely into nebulous nothingness. Moderates stand for nothing. Impartiality is a vice and a poison for the cowardly because right and wrong exist. Deeply saddened. Making the switch to The Fat Electrician and WhatIfAltHist for my history cravings."
MhwoigsS4A8,Trash politics. Never trust the government. Re do it all
MhwoigsS4A8,"It would be interesting to know if you were in a swing state, if your stance on who to vote for would be the same."
MhwoigsS4A8,I look back of some of the Presidents we’ve had in the past.. and I think if Trump and Kamala become President it won’t be as bad as some of the Presidents from our History… well … going from Biden to anybody will be an upgrade 😂 we can give a Sloth 🦥 the Presidency after Biden and we’ll be better off 😂
MhwoigsS4A8,To be honest… I’m just happy Biden is out because it felt like we didn’t even have a Persistent… Biden never came out and spoke to the people.. it felt like 4 years of “ooohh shit we have a President still?🤔” 😂 easily one of the worse presidents of all time..
MhwoigsS4A8,"While I agree that abortion is not the primary issue for most voters, we have seen in the past that when Republicans push too far and oppose the big three exemptions, they get into major problems (Todd Akin, Richard Mourdoch in 2012 for example). The problem isn't Trump's position or his nominal stance, its what all these state legislatures are doing and Democrats are tying him too that. Just like Romney (among all his other problems) got dragged down by further right Republicans in that cycle. While only 7% list it as their primary issue, if that sample includes some of those ""Republican defectors"" you mentioned that Trump is losing to Harris, it could be decisive. Doubly so if paired with other issues related to Trump's temperament/behavior etc. 

We have also seen many places, including Kansas and Ohio, where substantial segments of normally Republican voters voted to protect abortion rights. 

We make a mistake assuming that everyone is a monolith, but there were large numbers of quietly pro-choice Republicans out there and now that Roe is gone, they are not pleased. To maintain a broad coalition it is important to not satisfy one faction at the expense of another, and in some ways electorally speaking, that is what has occurred. 

For record, I do consider myself to be pro-life, but I support the big three exceptions as Reagan did. I tend to be a realist though when it comes to who supports what and we will see tonight whether this is decisive or not."
MhwoigsS4A8,My 60 year old professor told us “I would hate to be getting into adulthood in this generation”
MhwoigsS4A8,We had a referendum in the UK in 2011 to adopt ranked voting (AV) and kick out FPTP for parliamentary elections. It was massively misconstrued to the public by the right-wing press and rejected. The same right-wingers ended up kicking themselves this year as the conservative vote was split between the Tories and Reform.
MhwoigsS4A8,"Wild at a time like this you still take a stand to not vote for a president because you find excuses to put Trump equally as unelectable as Kamala. Wild. This country is going down the drain but your personal defiance has to come before that, wild."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Very much a democrat myself, but love your passion about unity, keep it up man"
MhwoigsS4A8,"Also the 270-268 option is going to be hell in the court system because the 2020 census has admitted to screwing up the population sizes in some Republican states, which should’ve resulted in Florida with another electoral vote and NY with one fewer. That will be a mess"
MhwoigsS4A8,"14:34 I have a playlist for it on my channel, but it’s understandable if you don’t have time to react to them all. Some particularly good ones are John Tyler, William Henry Harrison, both George Bushes, and Joe Biden, though I think all of them have their interesting moments."
MhwoigsS4A8,No name calling? No insults? Keep it civil? You're definitely a never-Trumper😅
MhwoigsS4A8,"I feel like the Electoral College is just pointless at this point. If it was to force candidates to not overlook the needs of some smaller, less influential states, it has clearly failed. As we see in this election, the smaller states have largely been ignored as candidates focus attention on s handful of swing states. 

Balance of power is provided by Congress/ specifically the Senate. The executive should be a popular vote. That is my humble opinion."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I don't see the relevance of the increase in early GOP voters... Last time Trump demonized mail in ballots, democrats believed in much higher numbers in the dangers of the pandemic, they avoided going in person even if it was trivial. This time they were much more open for early voting.... So you should expect huge increases. On the other hand if DNC voters are higher this time around with early voting, now that would mean something scary for Trump"
MhwoigsS4A8,As someone from the UK this election fascinates me 😅
MhwoigsS4A8,"In response to the agreeing to disagree stuff, I think reading comprehension is dying in this country, and so people take everything someone says to mean something unintentionally different. Most people who follow your channel, from what I can gather, are more intelligent than a lot of Americans out there. I am also glad to see that people from other countries follow your channel, for the record.

Along with that, I think, for the last eight years, Trump has motivated people (even those who don’t like him) to have a very angry, bipartisan demeanor."
MhwoigsS4A8,Anyone else love how the live chat is a bunch of people from both sides wish casting their preferred candidate is going to easily win and pretending that said wish casting is based off of some legitimate analysis lol.
MhwoigsS4A8,If we don't get Trump the population under 36 men better be worried because this chick will chase war
MhwoigsS4A8,If there is some shady things going on then it'll go to the Senate to vote
MhwoigsS4A8,"It's going to be interesting night for sure, hoping for a harris win, but a very close race, or so it seems.. waiting too see what surprises will happen.."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I hope whoever wins the American people don’t have to suffer political violence.
Chris you are what I think of as a good Conservative. 
Im a Social Democrat UK voter (Labour) and we may disagree, but it would be in a civilised respectful way."
MhwoigsS4A8,There is a 0% chance that if Trump loses he concedes without claiming fraud/cheating/etc
MhwoigsS4A8,I'm calling it Trump in a land slide
MhwoigsS4A8,"National polls don't seem to matter, because I think Trump has never had a chance of winning the majority (or even plurality) of the popular vote, and he knew this all along. He wants to win the electoral vote, and he knows where to focus his campaign for that."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Trump 2024. If not, ball game’s over."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Good polling does exist, but its very expensive to do properly and it is hard. The parties' internal polling is usually very very good because they paya lot for it to be accurate. Media sponsored polls, on the other hand,  tend to be more garbage because media companies are not willing to pay the price of getting  good poll. Plus, media, and therefore people, have a fundamental misunderstanding of polling. Very rarely is margin of error discussed. So when you see your talking head speaking a about a one or two point margin, they should declare that a tie. If one candidate moves up or down a couple of points from one poll to the next, that's static. That's no change. If media is going to be as obsessed with polling as they are, they should be better at explaining them and understanding them."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I feel like the Alaska ranked voting in the last house election showed how it works perfectly. The individual who had the most votes on the initial voting was not popular enough to get 50% of the vote. But everyone there got to select initially there favorite of the 4 people on the ballot. People voting for the 3rd and 4th place finisher did not want the highest vote getter and ranked them lower then the Democrat who won the seat. The Democrat who won the seat would have won if it was only a 2 person race. 

Similar to what happened with the Kentucky governor race a few years ago. A state can be firmly one side or the other, but if you throw unpopular people on the ballot. They are going to lose.

Alaska was the election that proved to me that ranked voting can be done at a large enough level and actually work as intended."
MhwoigsS4A8,1:12:00 Not even if it is right does the Selzer Poll indicate a landslide in Iowa. A few percentage points is NOT a landslide.
MhwoigsS4A8,"1:15:00 Desantus was supposed to be Trump without baggage.
O course republicans cannot voice an opinion to get a message out until Trump."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I'm under the firm belief that Kansas is going to be a lot closer than people think. I believe trump will still win it, but it's not going to be 7, 8, 9%"
MhwoigsS4A8,1:11:15 not voting Democrat because they tell you to not to vote for them presumably because you aren't welcome in their presence isn't being a single-issue voter. It's being a voter who wants to vote next time!
MhwoigsS4A8,1:02:45 North Carolina is running on the abortion issue.  Thus Harris wins
MhwoigsS4A8,"I voted this morning and I didn't vote for either of the presidential major nominees.  I appreciate your time and effort for this.  I didn't stream it because the NFL game more important to me.  

I have never voted for Donald Trump because I don't feel like he cares for the country.   I didn't vote democratic party because of policies.  

Thank you for everything you do!"
MhwoigsS4A8,Vote on VIBES not policies 💙💙💙
MhwoigsS4A8,"I love the fact that you’re pushing for unity!  Republicans or Democrats. We are all Americans 
Go America 🇺🇸!!"
MhwoigsS4A8,Florida is solidly blue? Interesting take.
MhwoigsS4A8,Just unsubscribed after you said the best outcome is kamaler winning... youre done bud. Goodbeye forever
MhwoigsS4A8,"Honestly, Nixon and Kennedy were the last 2 candidates that i wouldnt have cared who won because they were both good"
MhwoigsS4A8,I think Harris is going to ge 300-350 electoral votes.
MhwoigsS4A8,"I am pretty sure that Harris will win in a walk. Momentum is on her side. Post-Dobbs we have seen Republicans underperforming. Women have been turning out in droves.

I have seen many Republicans online stating that they voted for Harris."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I don't understand what's good about Trump policy. He ran massive deficits in a booming economy. This time all he's talking about is tariffs. 

I understand if you lean republican, but Trump hasn't really gotten anything done, he hasn't even talked about what he's going to do."
MhwoigsS4A8,Let’s hope Trump loses and fades away to never be heard from again. Just go golf and enjoy the rest of your days with your family.
MhwoigsS4A8,We ALL love President Trump ❤🇺🇸
MhwoigsS4A8,"I’m about 60/40 confident in a Trump victory. Wouldn’t be super surprised either way, but I think Trump’s ceiling is bigger than Harris’s."
MhwoigsS4A8,JD Vance is the most unliked VP as long as there has been polling. 😊
MhwoigsS4A8,"Will make no difference to Trump being close or not, he'll call it stolen, can't ever stick to what he says that doesn't benefit him. Lol, he might not be another Grover Cleveland but at least he'll only be the second president to not attend his opponent's inauguration day. It's the most important election where Europe is concerned, it matters more now the way the world has gone, those will vote for Trump regardless whatever anyone says or shows and proof, completely have been taken in by him and believe that much with what he has said ever since."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I also predict the dems will sweep the house and senate, ted cruz will lsoe his senate seat.  this election 2024 will ruin the Rep party. causing a civil war within the party to purge maga elements from it, the Republicans will be so blasted that you wont have a rep pres. until 2032. the 2020s belong to the demo party."
MhwoigsS4A8,"1:11:10 Yes, there are a lot of other issues. Harris is far left on EVERY SINGLE ONE of them. If you drink the Kool-Aid of her new centrist policy positions (panicking right before the election) and ignore her proven track record as the furthest left person in Congress, then idk what to tell you. It's simply just ignoring reality so you can claim neutrality while watching your country slip into left-wing extremism. It's completely unprincipled, in my opinion, if you are actually concerned with conservative values."
MhwoigsS4A8,I dont trust polls and Alan Lichtman the nostradamus of USA elections with a 90 percent accuracy rate and who predicted a trump 2016 win already predicted harris will win tonight Nov 5 2024. and I personally predict harris will win 320 electoral votes doing better than biden in 2020. Trump the garbage man will go to the GARBAGE CAN
MhwoigsS4A8,"The polls are always historically biased against Trump. This was even the case in 2020 when he lost. He outperformed the polls by like 5 pts.

The idea that we can take the polls to be the Bible is laughable. Especially with things like the Iowa poll that came out the other day. Polls that are 10-15% outside of the norm are not a fluke. They're well outside the margin of error. They're voter suppression.

In my opinion, you see Trump sweep the swing states and pick up one or two ""solid"" blue states like VA or NH. The idea that none of these pollsters see a world where he wins ~330 EV is insane and just goes to show you how out of touch with the common person these ""elites"" are. That being said, I don't think any more than that is realistic, but the idea that Trump's absolute best-case scenario is pretty much what he did in 2016 is just stupid."
MhwoigsS4A8,"As long as the Democratic Party keeps packing swing states with illegal immigrants, we will never have a fair election again. Trump is up on most polls, but somehow we don’t know who’s going to win? How does that work? The electoral college is weird."
MhwoigsS4A8,Well I for one am super glad we're so reliant on the polls because they've never been wrong and always super fairly model elections and absolutely don't put out polls specifically as a means of voter suppression for one party.
MhwoigsS4A8,just got back from voting TRUMP 2024
MhwoigsS4A8,"To be fair to Adam Langowski, he wasn’t saying who they have to vote for Trump or can’t vote for Harris if they’re conservative. A more accurate restating of what he said is that it’s unlikely that conservatives will vote for someone saying and “believing” the things that Harris has said."
MhwoigsS4A8,"it's so funny, when trump got elected in 2016, i told myself ""this guy is gonna be the 2nd Grover Cleveland"" i just had a gut feeling he would lose reelection but still there for 2024 to win..."
MhwoigsS4A8,Thank you for doing this vlog/video. Makes me feel reassured about my position of neither and did a great job explaining the possibilities of this election
MhwoigsS4A8,I love ur channel 🐧. Please do videos on Teotihacan and the Minoans 🏺🎸🇺🇲🦅🪐🦖🦖🦖🦖
MhwoigsS4A8,“This election leads me to drink”. Truer words…
MhwoigsS4A8,Michigan is dead even.
MhwoigsS4A8,Electoral college is cringe
MhwoigsS4A8,personally I don't see Rick Scott getting re-elected in florida. I know many conservatives who do not like him as a person because it's very clear he's in it for himself and nothing else.
MhwoigsS4A8,"About being able to just disagree again and the polarization, I think that mostly comes because people don't disagree on policies and on how to fix certain problems nowadays, but they disagree on the fundamental realities we live in. Used to be something happened and then we would have differences in opinion on what to do about it. But nowadays people just live either in one reality or the other and they are complete oposites. Hard to then just politely disagree because everyone thinks the other are living in crazy land"
MhwoigsS4A8,"As most everyone would say I hope you the reader vote for *insert party here* however if you can’t decide between the two, my hope is you vote for a third party. Not on the grounds you want them to win, but on the grounds you want to open up the floor to more political parties and more options than just 2 people. 

During my first time voting, I could not vote for either candidate in my decision. So I voted 3rd party to say “Even though I could just not vote. I am saying I would like to vote with more party options than just two. Even the founding fathers warned of the two party system and I agree with them on this matter.

ChatGPT says:

Yes, some of the Founding Fathers, particularly George Washington and John Adams, warned against the dangers of a two-party system. In his Farewell Address, Washington cautioned that political parties could lead to divisive factions that would threaten national unity and government stability. He believed that partisan divisions would enable foreign influence and domestic manipulation, prioritizing party interests over those of the nation.

John Adams echoed these concerns, famously stating, “There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other.” He feared this would undermine the nation’s unity and lead to political strife.

While the Founding Fathers did not fully anticipate how the party system would evolve, their warnings remain a significant part of discussions about the impact of political polarization and partisanship in the United States today.

So again I say, if you did not plan to vote to begin with, and you like neither candidate or if you can’t choose between the candidates, vote 3rd party to make your voice clear. Thank you for your time."
MhwoigsS4A8,"What you said about a daughter brought a tear to my eye.. Such an amazing man and father.. I hope you continue to grow.. Unlike others, you're not only good at this.. You're also REAL"
MhwoigsS4A8,"Trump 297, Harris 241: Kamala hangs on to Michigan in a nail biter while Trump takes the other six battleground states."
MhwoigsS4A8,Can't in my conscience vote for somebody like Kamela tbh. Trump flawed as he may be is at least capable of leading a country.
MhwoigsS4A8,Well there are two Seniors voting for Trump
MhwoigsS4A8,If Trump losses then DeSantis is the republican nominee.
MhwoigsS4A8,The fact you have Arizona Blue when democrats have conceded pretty much… is a brutal start but I love your videos so I’ll continue lol
MhwoigsS4A8,I wish the VP candidates were the presidential ones.
MhwoigsS4A8,"“A democrat won Alaska through a fluke in the system”, 

Actually, if most people’s second place wins an election, that does seem more fair in my eyes than someone winning with less than 50% approval, but that depends on your way of thinking"
MhwoigsS4A8,49:16
MhwoigsS4A8,Imagine voting for Kamala Harris. Absolutely wild. Just a few months ago her popularity was at historic lows for a VP. She never ran a primary. No one likes her. She can’t form coherent sentences without reading a teleprompter and her accent changes on a daily basis depending on which demographic she’s talking with.
MhwoigsS4A8,"Lol all indicators and special elections show its gonna be a fast night..
Selzer doesn't release her methodology because she runs a phone bank with 1500 women and men she personally met across Iowa.  She vets everyone and they have to vote every year to stay on list."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Heading to work as a poll worker, remember whoever is elected, GOD is still the one in charge. Let’s hope after the election is over we will work to again become the “UNITED” States of America. Let GOD’s will be done!"
MhwoigsS4A8,"In fairness to Vance, in regards to the Springfield thing, what is he gonna say? “Sorry guys, my guy sometimes says some outlandish stuff”. I don’t know if it is so much Vance buying into the idea, or Vance having to defend it because what Trump said was very specific and very public. VP nominee cannot be out there calling his guy crazy."
MhwoigsS4A8,I hope for a Harris victory. but mostly I pray that there will still be another election in 2028.
MhwoigsS4A8,That would be pretty sad trying to win demorats and Loose Republicabs for it
MhwoigsS4A8,This is the first election ive ever been unsure too. And the first election im genuinely worried about what will happen if the left wins. I do not like precedents they have tried to establish.
MhwoigsS4A8,I personally cant see why people would support Kamala for these reasons. 1 She wasn't chosen she was installed by the dnc 2 she said herself not only was she apart of the the decisions that were made in the Biden administration but even worse she said there's not a single thing she would've done differently which is horrible considering those are the same policies that got Biden kicked out by his own party. 3  Albert Einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result. BIden was a preview of Harris so there's no way I want another 4 years of that. But something I think is most important is people focus way too much on who acts more presidential than who actually has better policies that work.
MhwoigsS4A8,"British here, I want Trump, but I expect Harris to win"
MhwoigsS4A8,"People pretending they know how this or that group are voting always cracks me up

Republicans are breaking for Harris, late deciding voters are moving to Harris.

Wow, the stuff people say"
MhwoigsS4A8,You are a great teacher man! God bless!
MhwoigsS4A8,"I don’t think this will be as close as people think. Iowa’s Selzer poll says a completely different story and that poll has been incredibly accurate. Trump’s internal emails also show a very desperate effort in states like PA, GA, NV, and AZ"
MhwoigsS4A8,I will vote Nov 5
MhwoigsS4A8,"Left right, red blue, same corporate interest. Neither side is for any of us."
MhwoigsS4A8,I'm a registered Independent who leans center-right from Scranton Pennsylvania.I just can't bring myself to vote for a megalomaniac wannabe dictator like Trump. Tomorrow my vote will be for Harris! I hope we see the end of the MAGA cult
MhwoigsS4A8,I respect your position more than most others.
MhwoigsS4A8,"I appreciate the idea of agreeing disagreeably, 
and I have heated arguments with friends that I disagree with.
But in life we must have red lines.

I just can't fathom people voting for someone who publicly called on his Vice-President to subvert the constitution and the election result.
Can you imagine if a President Sanders did that?
It goes, or should go, beyond policy preferences or partisanship.

I've heard Chris say a couple of times that he wishes people would stop talking about January 6th, which I would find concerning from anyone, but from an historian, and one that I respect, it's disturbing.
Does it come from a belief in American exceptionalism, and the idea that ""It can't happen here?""
Because I think that it absolutely can, probably only an economic downturn away."
MhwoigsS4A8,Trump also was in Virginia. I don't think he would've gone there if his analysts didn't see something
MhwoigsS4A8,I dont know enough about the difference between Democrats and Republicans in the USA. I would assume Democrats = Labor in Oz and Republicans = Liberals in Oz. The one question I would like answered is why does Trump want to be President again? Has he a vindicative agenda hidden within that thick head or is it just about EGO or maybe a bit of both. Not a fan of Harris so if I was an American I wouldn't vote  but the thought of Trump being President again fills me with dread. The only good thing about it is he couldn't run again if he wins.
MhwoigsS4A8,"i'd say 287 or 297... in Wiscosnin Biden and Clinton both were like 7-9% ahead in polls... Clinton lost, Biden won by 0.7
European here...If Marxist Kamala wins... we`re doomed."
MhwoigsS4A8,1:36:40 blew my mind. How did never occur to me that Lincoln and Napoleon were both leaders of their countries at the same time. Wow.
MhwoigsS4A8,"I doubt Pennsylvania will vote differently from Wisconsin and Michigan. Back in 2020, Trump told his supporters to not vote by mail, this time it's not the case, which explains why more Republicans are voting early this time. 

I confidently predict Harris will win the popular vote, and not-so-confidently predict she will win the electoral college thanks to the 3 aforementioned Rust Belt states. My gut tells me women voters angry at Trump over the abortion issue will turn out to vote for her."
MhwoigsS4A8,This election feels so inconsequential and important at the same time.
MhwoigsS4A8,"After seeing Trump's response to being shot I don't see how you can question his motive also the people endorsing him would have been unfathomable 4 years ago, RFK, Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Megyn Kelly, numerous pro athletes and even rappers. It boggles my mind that anyone could be undecided at this point or sit it out because they don't like either candidate, these candidates have almost nothing in common I find it hard to believe that anyone falls somewhere perfectly in the middle of both"
MhwoigsS4A8,"When I was young, my civics teacher mentioned one of the cruelest things you could say to someone was ""May you live in interesting times."" I get it now... I could do with much less interesting times at this point."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Whatever happens tomorrow for the love of whatever god you believe in, please, mind your manners and do what you can to calm people down. Life goes on and the strong people of this country will be ok!"
MhwoigsS4A8,"America stands on the verge of electing its first insurrectionist since the post-Civil War era—a disturbing milestone that reflects a troubling retreat from the responsibilities it has shouldered on the world stage since World War II. Once a confident leader of the postwar and post-Cold War global order, the United States now seems to be retreating into itself, abandoning the ideals that once made it a beacon for democracy and stability worldwide.

This withdrawal from global leadership threatens to cast a shadow over the 21st century, creating a vacuum that authoritarian regimes are eager to fill. The implications are profound: without American commitment to democratic principles, countries like Ukraine and Taiwan face a perilous future, standing alone against aggressive forces. This shift is more than a national issue; it paves the way for a resurgence of authoritarianism, signaling a dangerous realignment of global power and values.

Good luck to Ukraine, good luck to Taiwan—and indeed, good luck to America. The world is watching."
MhwoigsS4A8,"When Europe is anywhere from 60-80% pro Harris, and Russia is pro-Trump, does that not alone tell America everything they need to know? We in the UK can't fathom how this is such a close race, when in any other western democracy it would be a landslide."
MhwoigsS4A8,"Trump should win 293-245 based on momentum, past errors of 2016 and 2020, and averages of this cycle."
MhwoigsS4A8,Biden won PA by over 80k votes (i think). I personally think enough of those people will still vote blue and that Harris will JUST win it.
MhwoigsS4A8,as a european i vieuw the american elections as anything but democratic. the moment anyone wins the majority of a state all those other votes are thrown into the trash bin. should just do majority vote as a indicator who wins elections instead of electorol vote.
MhwoigsS4A8,Unc might be a Groyper. W VloggingThroughHistory
MhwoigsS4A8,Maneshevitz?!?!? Hahaha with sprite? I'm going to have to try that. Enjoyed listening to this with election insomnia.
MhwoigsS4A8,"Abortion is going to be a major issue with it being on the ballot, Disagree with you strongly on that one"
MhwoigsS4A8,Theyre underestimating Harris. She will win
MhwoigsS4A8,Trump will make America great again
MhwoigsS4A8,"Comparing early voting to 2020 will not tell you anything. Last election Trump was telling people not to vote by mail and to vote on election day, the democrats was encouraging vote by mail. Obviously this election will have better early voting numbers for republicans cos they’ve actually encouraged it this time."
MhwoigsS4A8,Just get out and rock the VOTE! This election is TRUMP'S to lose
MhwoigsS4A8,If you want to see what's going on go to the left biased new York times....lord this guy is a brainwashed stooge
MhwoigsS4A8,we have not learned our lesson from 2022 and still put too much trust in polling and think too little about what might cause them to be wrong
MhwoigsS4A8,"I’m surprised companies are allowed to publish how people have voted if they chose to do so early. It could potentially affect how people will vote which sounds rather iffy to me. In the UK, we have no idea how people voted until 10pm when the polls closed and were presented with an “Exit Poll” which projects based on how people actually voted."
MhwoigsS4A8,"First I thought Trump would beat Biden. Then Harris took over and I thought she would beat Trump. Then I thought Trump would beat Harris, now I don't know at all."
MhwoigsS4A8,Thought Harris would take but I just left Trump last minute rally in GR I'm thinking he takes  Michigan
MhwoigsS4A8,Apparently Florida was shorted in the 2020 census by 2 electoral votes. It would be crazy if in that 270-268 scenario it goes to the Supreme Court for a decision.
MhwoigsS4A8,"I think the 2028 R candidate will DeSantis, especially if Trump loses."
MhwoigsS4A8,"What specific tax policy of Harris's do you dislike Chris?

As for government spending, the Republicans haven't proven any better than Democrat administrations."
MhwoigsS4A8,"For Iowa, I really hope it lands perfectly in the middle of the two accurate pollsters...

I'm all on board for Harris, but I feel like we really need the talk about polling errors and how they go both ways..."
MhwoigsS4A8,"I have immense hope for our American society, but in my heart I don't see anything going well regardless of who wins. I hope I'm wrong but I' know there are quite a few out there who can relate to that sentiment. Be safe, give love, and let's all pray that democracy survives the next few weeks"
MhwoigsS4A8,"Fraud wasn’t an accusation, it’s true. The law changes themselves were illegal."
MhwoigsS4A8,I would be surprised if Wisconsin votes to the left of Pennsylvania and Nevada
MhwoigsS4A8,"As someone who never paid close attention to politics in a pre-Trump world due to my age, I cannot figure out how Tip O’Neill could have been friends with Reagan when I try to put myself in his shoes."
MhwoigsS4A8,The worst option is 270 268 because of the questionable census results in 2020. Republicans will have a reasonable claim that Florida should have +2 electoral college votes. I think it is New Jersey and New York -1 but I am not sure.
MhwoigsS4A8,"Thought it  interesting how Ohio lost a seat because of larger populations areas that are filled with illegals who can’t vote, while the people who can vote lose their voice. Vance and something about this on Rogan’s podcast"
MhwoigsS4A8,RFK had my vote but he dropped out. In the same boat as you not voting in Tennessee which Trump will get so don’t matter
MhwoigsS4A8,I think Trump wins all the swing states except Michigan. A pretty blowout victory. I think some states like NH might surprise the dems too.
MhwoigsS4A8,Ive always figured VTH as a neocon. As a liberal im a Trump supporter. Ive noticed that the Trump supporters are much more tolerant.
MhwoigsS4A8,"I fundamentally disagree with you on so many things, but I think your mindset is really a beautiful thing. Will always love and support your reactions and content, keep up the good work!"
MhwoigsS4A8,We have too many close races today! The nation would be a lot calmer if the races weren’t so close every election year!
MhwoigsS4A8,That you call them Battleground states shows me tto much of your mentality US Americaner........... grow up
dc8XAXEC9eg,See the complete playlist of my ERBH reactions - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKLxDLpQY5poKrF39cKw9xkvTs5B3X_EO
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Just looking at the profile pictures of you, I can already tell YouTube’s algorithm boosted your channel because once it realized you were a history teacher who was anti Trump from it’s transcripts. Algorithm categorizes everything and has extreme social engineering now. Too bad. Dudes about to become one of the greatest US presidents in history and not even Alphabet inc can stop him."
dc8XAXEC9eg,they put such a doomer spin on springfield it was ridiculous
dc8XAXEC9eg,Coming back after the election to think about all the firsts and seconds with this election. Trump of course being our first president in the 21st century to serve 2 nonconsecutive terms and the second over all after Garfield. Vance is the first marine VP and his wife Usha is the first Indian-American second lady. Susie Wiles will be the first female Chief of Staff. He's also the first Republican since Bush's second term to win both the popular and electoral vote. Will be interesting to see what gets achieved the next 4 years.
dc8XAXEC9eg,I can't believe they still make these epic rap battles Hhahaha
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I think it's wrong of JD Vance to talk about childless cat ladies, because Victoria Nuland has children."
dc8XAXEC9eg,That attempted assassination really holds SO MUCH WEIGHT now!
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy FTW
dc8XAXEC9eg,Isn’t the better question why Biden had classified documents before ever becoming president? Or why this problem of mishandling of classified documents goes back to the Reagan administration
dc8XAXEC9eg,"""much like your bowels I evacuated suddenly""
becaue trump shit himself at the debate lmao"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Let me guess, a liberal ? Just asking"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Trump never made fun of a reporter's disability.  That's fake news that was debunked 8 years ago.  He used that same mannerism when criticizing many people and had no idea the reporter even had a disability.  But sure, keep claiming to be a ""conservative"" while you promote far left propaganda 8 years after it has been thoroughly debunked."
dc8XAXEC9eg,He did it...
dc8XAXEC9eg,You gotta react to the Obama vs Romney now!! And I’d love to see your reaction to Eastern vs Western Philosophers!!
dc8XAXEC9eg,"In a rap battle, everything is on the line. Anything can be said. Trump won by a landslide. Kamala said ""Beard's weird."" Unironically."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Kinda feels like you're being a little biased man. You go on about Trump talking about crass things, bit nothing about Harris? Little sketchy man."
dc8XAXEC9eg,""" jesus H. huckleberry christ "" Teddy won wid dat opening alone 🤣"
dc8XAXEC9eg,VTH doing rap break-downs is the youtube i didnt know i needed. Do Hit Em Up next :D :D
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy won
dc8XAXEC9eg,Well...the winner is clearly Teddy!!! Shout-out to the Bull Moose!!!
dc8XAXEC9eg,Who’s here after they called the winner after the election!
dc8XAXEC9eg,The first opening run with Trump hits hard.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy won
dc8XAXEC9eg,The presidential raps are alwayz absolutely brutal. I love it.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Now that the election is (basically) over, will you be releasing a video sharing your thoughts on it?"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Kamala Harris did not get the nomination ""un-democratically."" That's like saying if the President steps down or, is removed from office, when the VP is sworn into the presidency, they became the president ""un-democratically."" Kamala Harris got the nomination according to democratic rules which have been in place for a while. Even now, with many people knowing how that works, no one is trying to change those rules for potential future issues. Even republicans aren't pushing for such change."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Eh 2016 ERB was batter
dc8XAXEC9eg,weekend at Bernie's is great lmao
dc8XAXEC9eg,"4:12 saying you're pro-abortion would be like saying you want every fetus be aborted when compared with pro-life. that's why it's pro-choice, because obviously that's just exactly what they want, the choice
4:40 also you're 100% correct, this might be why we have a cult of personality around leaders and more specifically trump nowa days"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I can confirm from the future trump won
dc8XAXEC9eg,"It doesn’t matter who won. Either way, humanity lost."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Roosevelt won
dc8XAXEC9eg,You should do a reaction to the order (2024) film trailer
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Im not saying kamala is going to win, im just saying that the person who has gone first in the last 3 presidential ones also ended up loosing the election."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Pineapple on pizza?!?!?!

*flips tables while foaming at the mouth*

You dare bring up such controversy?!?!?!

*fixes the table and flips it again*"
dc8XAXEC9eg,As a history fan let me tell you I would love so much to spend time with you and pick your brain. I truly would cherish that
dc8XAXEC9eg,"As a Brit, the first thing I recalled was the Date. As a historian, you will recall that 5th November 1605 was the date that the gunpowder plot was foiled. Let's hope that the result isn't heading that way."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Kamala can barely talk. How can she rap?
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Harris was actually not at the Capitol when the Jan 6th riot happened. It’s also difficult to say Trump was mocking the reporter’s disability, you can see many clips of him mocking non-disabled reporters in the same way, which appears to be mocking them for being nervous"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Personally it would have made more sense for George washington to appear in this rap battle than Theodore Roosevelt because he was against the idea of political parties and blind party loyalty.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Wait you think him as ex potus got to explain why he has classified documents which he declassified?😂
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Actually so, I'm voting Kamala today. It is another ""Who is the lesser of two turds"" for me and I'm picking the lesser turd. For this though, I actually think Trump won. I felt the rap insults were a little more scathing from him. Don't get me wrong... I REALLY wanted Harris to win this one because I'm not terribly confident about the election."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Trump did not mock the New York Times reporter’s disability. The hand motions he did was something he always did when acting as though someone was flustered. He had done it several times about his primary opponents.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Damn, couldn't bring up the reference to his sexual assault trials or jeffrey epstein, damn. Also the woman who ate the cat was American born and the immigrants were invited because no one was there to do any jobs"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Just wanted to say Kamala's father was not a marxist. He did teach a course on Marxist economics but he was seen more as a Keynesian economist. Yes that was pretty off to the left for the times but it's still a capitalist form of economy.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Just by your commentary, I 100% already know who you're voting for. 😂😂😂"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I've voted for the lesser of 2 evils mind set...
dc8XAXEC9eg,You didnt mention the only Historical event that happened under the Biden-Kamala regime; so no comment on the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal ?
dc8XAXEC9eg,Kamalas first line went over his head
dc8XAXEC9eg,13:20 It was either a moose or a bear. I think they chose well.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"At 3:32 Trump says ""your party aborted a state's right to vote"". Our narrator tied that to the way Kamala got the nomination. He certainly did reference that right beforehand but I think that line was about what happened to the Democratic New Hampshire Primary."
dc8XAXEC9eg,🇺🇸Trump 2024🇺🇸
dc8XAXEC9eg,"In many countries we agree on few things
Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen 1889 (France for comparaison to the US)"".
Article I – 
« Les hommes naissent et demeurent libres et égaux en droits. Les distinctions sociales ne peuvent être fondées que sur l’utilité commune. »
""Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.""
Article II – 
""Le but de toute association politique est la conservation des droits naturels et imprescriptibles de l'homme. Ces droits sont la liberté, la propriété, la sûreté, et la résistance à l'oppression.""
""The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression.""
Article VI – 
""La liberté consiste à pouvoir faire tout ce qui ne nuit pas à autrui : ainsi, l'exercice des droits naturels de chaque homme n'a de bornes que celles qui assurent aux autres membres de la société la jouissance de ces mêmes droits. Ces bornes ne peuvent être déterminées que par la loi.""
""Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the fruition of these same rights. These borders can be determined only by the law""
Article XI -
""La libre communication des pensées et des opinions est un des droits les plus précieux de l'homme : tout citoyen peut donc parler, écrire, imprimer librement, sauf à répondre de l'abus de cette liberté dans les cas déterminés par la loi.""
""The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law""

This text is the included at the beginning of the constitutions of both the Fourth French Republic (1946) and Fifth Republic (1958), and is considered valid as constitutional law.
The main difference is the lack of any religious reference..."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"In my opinion, Teddy won."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I love your content but from a horrible practicing Catholic , I don’t think your a representation of a middle ground conservative.  Our politics have slidden to the left since Obama has gotten in office.  Run jfk right now on all of his positions and tell me what party he would align with .  Please answer honestly.  I think you have trouble seeing this or admitting it and lump in trump supporters with the farthest right people while not doing the same on the left.  I live in nj and I’m a union worker where must of my union brother are voting for Trump.  We see the culture moving to far left affecting our revisionist history and the way we treat our children.  Gen z identify as over 20% lgbt.  It’s a social contagion and he seems to go over his head"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Ugh, this reaction. Anything Trump says “That’s disrespectful & inappropriate” LOL."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Teddy, i mean Theodore won. Lol."
dc8XAXEC9eg,The ERBs are the only things Trump has legitimately won.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Just to be clear, Harris' father was a professor in Marxism. He wasn't actually a Marxist"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Hey VTH big big fan!! Been following for awhile, since about 70k I believe, BIG congrats on your continued success and growth of your channels. I recently had a video idea I wondered if you’d be interested in doing. Given you are better informed and educated than possibly most of your viewers on our history I was wondering if you be willing to do a video where you give your opinion on who you believe would of done a better job of the presidency between the two big candidates of each race (pre bush)and maybe even give a brief explanation as to why? To give a specific example,..do you believe if Charles Hughes had won in 1916 (or Teddy Roosevelt in 1912)if he would have served as president better than Woodrow Wilson. Thanks for the awesome and very informative content you continue to release"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Was it just me who thought that the ""aborted states right to vote"" line referenced Colorado's decision to have Trump removed from the ballot?"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Pineapple on pizza is an ABOMINATION!! Lol
dc8XAXEC9eg,Theodore Roosevelt won
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy won
dc8XAXEC9eg,Failed the bar. That's. Double bar.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy won
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I don't know why but such an immense sadness landed on me when you explained TR's reference to ""we hold these truths to be self evident"" and completed the quote. Thinking about those words and what an incredible ideal and dream to base a nation on, while in the midst of one of the most bizarre, polarizing, low brow, selfish and downright dumb election cycles ever. Those words mean nothing. It's all a huge dumpster fire and it's hard to see a way back from this.
I am not American even, but this for some reason made me real sad.

Great video, as always."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"that's because you are saying those things, that's why they're mad."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy Won obviously
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Even if this dude votes for Kamala,i think he would be totally wrong for that,but this is America he is allowed to have his opinion. He still keeps it 100% if every Democrat,and Republican was somewhat like this guy,i believe the world would be a better place. If only American politics weren't such a team sport"
dc8XAXEC9eg,it's not a choice to let someone bother you. stop saying that.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Are you doing a Movember @Vloggingthroughhistory?
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I agree with the last three elections, with whoever you think is the least disgusting. Can we go to system where people can not for four months before the election it goes on for so long...."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"VTH - ""feels like the last 3 elections we've been picking who sucked the least"" - hmmmm wonder if there is a common denominator for those three elections....hmmmmm"
dc8XAXEC9eg,">Doesnt it feel like who sucks the least each election

Yeah bc yall wont vote outside the duopoly. We have more than 2 options and always have

Solid ERB though"
dc8XAXEC9eg,So what's Temu Melania?
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Until 1968, there was no general election for candidates the way it is done today. Looking through the laws governing this new (since 1968) process, there are several exemptions and the health of a candidate is one exception where the delegates can vote for a substitute outside of the general election. It kind of sucks and so does the candidate, but it is all legal."
dc8XAXEC9eg,You are just delightful reacting to these. Would love to have you do more!
dc8XAXEC9eg,"""Guys they arent eating pets in springfield, they do it 2 hours away from there"" 😂 okay?? Its not really the location thats the issue"
dc8XAXEC9eg,13:58 that's just how democracy works
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I am from Bahrain, and I absolutely love your channel bro."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Hey Chris, I was trying to reach out to you regarding the 2025 Central Europe trip via the email address you provided for this VTH Youtube channel and also directly via the Wetravel website (""Ask A Question"" option). Unfortunately, so far, to no avail..."
dc8XAXEC9eg,There are already court hearings about pets being eaten in Ohio...
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Oh for the love of...

The documents was declassified when he was president, and he had them in a safe, in his office, biden had classified documents in a shoebox in his garage, that was open to all that could see...

Yes, he was friends with Jeffery, but he cut the contacts the moment he learned what Jeffery was up to, hell, there is even videos where he states people should investigate him...

Oh J6, the day when tourists had a guided tour and was escorted by the police...

I like ERBTH, but they really needed to factcheck their bars, because alot is out of context, hearsay or a mix of both..."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I do think that Trump won the battle, even though I think Harris would be the better president (I'm not american, so I can't vote). His flow and his bars were more impactful, maybe precisely because they were more vicious. Rap battles aren't primarily about substantive criticism afterall (though delivering such criticism can be very effective if done well)."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Now I want you to watch Teddy Roosevelt vs Winston Churchhill...
dc8XAXEC9eg,Tim Walz is a Chinese asset.
dc8XAXEC9eg,The winner: Roosevelt.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"They should have got Shane Gillis to do Trump. Or they should have just asked Trump. He probably would have done it - He's on everything else these days! :) Also... I don't see how it matters who ""won"" the rap battle. It's fiction :)"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I'm ready for this election to be over. Anything Trump is involved in is wrapped in controversy. But those that  wear the red sash won't call him on his b.s. because they hate democrats. I never seen so much love given to such a hateful person in my lifetime.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Im not from USA, and i dont really care who win your elections. But if i must look on thius objectively, if Kamala win, rest of the world is fuckt. USA is the guarantor of peace on the world...and if liber woke will win, rest of the world is doomed, because noone take seriously liberals, and Russia/China will do whatever the want. Noone take Kamala seriously, just like noone take Biden seriously (Biden as president, and we have war on Ukraine, war on middle east). I guarant to you, that if Kamala win, Taiwan will back to China, because noone will be scared of her."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"13:50 Also 2004 which may have been even worse than 2016, 2020, or 2024. I recall the awful feeling when I cast a vote for President that year.
Also Jack Handey and his deep thoughts were great."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"At 13:21, he's not just riding a moose, he's riding a WINGED, FLYING moose."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I thought the mugshot bar was about Trumps infamous mugshot. Then the Kamala Harris bar about ""I know youre not all ears, but listen up close."" was about Trump being shot in the ear. I mean that's what I got from that part lol"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I think Theodore Roosevelt won the battle 😂😂🤣.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Tady roosevelt won ‏‪15:52‬‏
dc8XAXEC9eg,No. No. JD Vance's BEARD.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Hey VTH, could you react to ``WW1 in a nutshell`` by  Icariaball, its not completely family friendly but its really funny"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I just want to say that we should not be normalizing the behavior of the former president. Several times you comment “that’s who he is.” I don’t want to get used to disdain. Are we supposed to accept him feigning a sex act on a microphone? With respect there should be only one option for decency in his election and I pray he that people will wake up that Trump is not fit for office.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Pineapple on pizza is WRONG!! Why not put apples on pizza? Or oranges? It’s just sick and wrong!!!
dc8XAXEC9eg,"This is a random request, but Lavader (the guy who did the critique of Oversimplified and the defense of Austria-Hungary’s invasion of Serbia) said in a post that he’s going to make an extensive/updated video defending Kaiser Wilhelm II. He previously did this before with his old video “The Peace Kaiser” but that he wants to improve on the video quality. I was hoping you could go back and react to Lavader’s “The Peace Kaiser” and then react to his next Kaiser Wilhelm II video when it comes out."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy won 100%
dc8XAXEC9eg,Sorry but you can tell he is pro kamala.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I think it cool that if trump wins  it'll be similar to the record of grover Cleveland with his two presidencies, it'll also be historical if Kamala wins either way it's a historical election"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Is it bad that I could seriously believe Trump would say ""You couldn't even make your own kids"" during a debate? I'm a lifelong Reagan era republican, but I cannot will not vote for Trump this year. Go Kamala."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"As a non-American I would say an insane rap battle like this might be spot on what election is all about in US. All the important issues are pushed into the background and insults are main things. So rap fits good. It's kind of sick and very sad that the great nation of US important election looks like a rap battle. All the lies and name calling looks like a battle between pre-teen kids in the schoolyard.
USA needs to change and man up. Not always hide behind the Constitution. Bring it into the 21 century. 

Gosh I really thought they eat pets in Springfield. But maybe I should trust you Chris better than next ex-President Trump/Vance claims. Insane isn't it ?"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Looks like I’ll be up all night on Tuesday 😊😊😊
dc8XAXEC9eg,"11:36 And crucially, the woman in that is a full born and bred red blooded American citizen"
dc8XAXEC9eg,7:53 I can perfectly understand accidentally having documents. The issue is Trump and the campaign actively tried to hide/keep documents.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"this modern history nonsense is just...the worst right now. These next two days need to happen, the future must become history, please let this just be history!"
dc8XAXEC9eg,“Who sucks the least” really gets me. Same thing happens in Japan where I live.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Have been here since about 10k subs or something ... your channel has grown quote big lol
dc8XAXEC9eg,"The most important issue I took from this was, pineapple DOES NOT belong on pizza! What has this country become? We must take a stand. Vote NO to pineapple on pizza."
dc8XAXEC9eg,flat. weakest battle beat sucks
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Kamala is a typical politician all talk no action and she admitted herself she was in power the last 4 years and is responsible for so many failures of this administration like the economy, border crisis, Afghanistan withdrawal and so much more. ""Joy Cometh in the mornin!"" she puts on different accents probably given to her by her handlers its just so fake and insulting to our intelligence that they think we fall for the bullshit, but i guess people do because abortion and things that get people all emotional. I care about the economy and not getting drafted into a pointless war, and Trump isnt the one id choose to take on the corruption in this country, but hes the only one who did it and can do it right now so thats why he has my vote. Hes a man of the people and by the way i am pretty left leaning."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Can you do a video on Fascism? I hear a lot from the political left and even some historians that Trump is a Fascist or going to be one if he wins. I just don't buy it and I feel this type of rhetoric is the reason why there have been multiple attempts on his life and not helpful to America. Can you explain from a historical standpoint if Trump really is a Fascist like the Hitlers and Mussolinis of the world?
dc8XAXEC9eg,is it okay if i use your voice for my speechify reader? ill sign up to be a patron either way but i need consent so i figured i will try and ask
dc8XAXEC9eg,The ones with Trump and Clinton and Biden are much better. Mike drop “will you shut up man” 😂
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I have go disagree on there being no issue with the Haitian migrants. Just because it's ""legal"" doesn't mean it's good or right. Why are we importing large amounts of Haitians at all? Why are so many dropped in 1 town in what was not long ago a swing state. We need to question this more, and not questioning and opposing things more fiercely is why we are not better off today."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy Roosevelt wins. Moose.
dc8XAXEC9eg,do you have anything on election speeches or campaigns?
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Theore Roosevelt won, twice, and also won the rap battle😂"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"3:00 he didn't make fun of the disability specifically, he does the move he did that was interpreted as such by the media all the time (when making fun of people)"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Interesting video
dc8XAXEC9eg,Whats the full title of this video? Youtube mobile is ass
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Jamaicans are still from Africa, right?"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Since I'm not American, I can easily say who won without political bias. It was Theodore Roosevelt."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Pro murder, call it what it is."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Thanks for doing this video definitely brightened my day
dc8XAXEC9eg,4:40 thats because biden was before the last century
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Hi , have you seen the documentary The brain washing of my dad , its fascinating.  Morning from Kent,  England 😊"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"As a Canadian, I feel like US elections are not significant enough to me where I can joke and laugh about it but still significant enough that the outcome could affect me greatly. Even if I have my personal favourite I love ERB's way of poking fun at both candidates and I can always appreciate it when people stay impartial with their opinions!"
dc8XAXEC9eg,January 6th is what got me into history and politics
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I appreciate your attempt to stay hands off, but how is pro-choice a sanitized term? It's an accurate term.  Nobody thinks abortions are good, but the right to a safe abortion is the right to bodily autonomy. It's not sanitizing a reality of ""pro-abortion"".  That's pretty wild; As though, and I'm going to say the quiet part out loud, killing a fetus is the POINT of the decision, rather than the litany of valid reasons a woman could not want to or be capable of raising a child being the point of the decision. 

If anything, pro-life is the sanitized term. Pro-what life? Just life? What about the life of the mother whose body has to be an incubator for almost a year, and faces potential health risks or death upon carrying it to term? What about the life of the ones that ARE carried to term and are forced to live in poverty or aren't even that lucky because their parents weren't capable of providing care so they die of malnutrition, or are abandoned, or become wards of the state and are cycled through the foster system? No? Doesn't matter so long as it's born? Its life from there is someone else's problem. Pro-life is just pro the life of the potential human that hasn't developed a consciousness yet.  Be for real."
dc8XAXEC9eg,If any former  president was gonna come back to life to angrily lecture modern day presidential candidates on a moose it would be Theodore Roosevelt
dc8XAXEC9eg,"“ Just because your father was something doesn’t mean you are or at least I hope not in my case.”

Daddy issues, no offense?"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"You think people won't freak out about your opinions on the subject of pineapple on pizza? Oh, bless your heart!"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I just find it ironic irl MAGA claims the Dems are the one who are divisive lmao
dc8XAXEC9eg,This dude seems like left-leaning anti- Trumper.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"""I won't even say who won"" -- c'mon, you have an easy out here.  Just say Teddy Roosevelt."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I think the ""JD Vance beard"" comment at about the 7:15 mark is not actually about the hair on Vance's face. Instead, it is bringing back an old term that was historically used to refer to a person who marries a gay man in order to prevent his homosexuality from being public knowledge. In this case, it would not be about Vance being gay. Instead, it refers to common belief that wealthy libertarian power brokers, such as Peter Thiel, insisted on Vance being Trump's VP so that if anything happens to Trump while he is President, Vance, as Thiel's protegee, becomes President. The result would be that Thiel and his fellow billionaire techno-libertarian cronies would effectively control the Presidency. That would put Trump as the figurehead beard for Vance being the person the powerbrokers intend to have as President."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Teddy 2024
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Tbh ""pro-life"" is even more sanitizer than ""pro-choice"" and less accurate to the position it describes"
dc8XAXEC9eg,You might enjoy Bluesky more than Twitter.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"3:00 incorrect, he did not make fun of any reporter's disability. He made fun of his poor reporting, and he lifts his hand like that every time he does his ""dumb guy mocking"" voice. He did the same movement for Ted Cruz, who notably, doesn't have such a disability."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I know you do a lot of history, i was wondering if you could do a comparison between real life history and the pre-war fallout."
dc8XAXEC9eg,its weird how you brag yourself as Ohioan but not have the excitement for Trump as most Ohioans had for Trump last years
dc8XAXEC9eg,Roosevelt won
dc8XAXEC9eg,"IMO, Teddy Roosevelt won it. He said far more than both of them in just one bar and slapped them both hard."
dc8XAXEC9eg,I think teddy won
dc8XAXEC9eg,The moose won
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I love your channel and usually agree with your content and opinions.  But I honestly feel you are showing your bias for Kamala.  Do I agree with everything Trump has said and done?  Heck no.  But as Christians, we have to vote biblically.  Which means, voting for the candidate who is pro-life....not pro-choice and in favor of murdering babies in the 9th month of pregnancy.  The crisis at our border, the bismal economy under the Biden-Harris administration....I could go on.  This is not a high school popularity contest.  You don't have to necessarily even like the guy.  But people need to vote on policy....not whether or not they like everything about the candidate's personality.  Right now we're on the precipice of WWIII on several fronts.  Kamala has no foreign policy and no freaking clue how to handle the foreign leaders.   All we know is she was raised in a middle class family.  🤦‍♀️  Not to mention the foreign leaders have zero respect for Kamala and think she's a total ditz ( an accurate assessment IMHO).  So which candidate is more qualified to keep us out of an all-out nuclear war?  (Hint:  it ain't Kamala)."
dc8XAXEC9eg,He was thinking he was the president and it was his right to take those materials. What was EVERY other president thinking?  Clintons underwear drawer. Bidens Open garage..( he didn't have executive privilege....)
dc8XAXEC9eg,"12:04 that’s the thing, it’s not legal. Vance explained it during the VP debate! Also at 13:03 her father’s not the only reason she gets labelled a marxist, many of her policies are marxist in that they deny the flawed reality of human nature."
dc8XAXEC9eg,You don't represent anything right leaning. You represent fence sitters who try to straddle both sides and pretend you have views from one side when you clearly don't. You must really look up to people like Mitt Romney or Dick Cheney: who never really did much for this country but tried to convince people they did.
dc8XAXEC9eg,4:30 Harris was on my ballot when I voted for Biden Harris. Undemocratic is a right wing political slogan
dc8XAXEC9eg,Who won the rap battle? Teddy obviously!
dc8XAXEC9eg,"According to investigations into Kamala Harris heritage, her father's family is from Jamaica but they were not black (they are from Irish descent). 
Also, she was raised in one of the most affluent neighbourhoods of Montreal, Canada - there is nothing ""middle class"" about her. She's full of lies."
dc8XAXEC9eg,The Ground News bit was the best part man!!
dc8XAXEC9eg,"From Urban Dictionary
Beard:
1. Someone hired as a celebrity's boyfriend/girlfriend by that celebritys management, usually for publicity."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Need you to react to a few of their videos
dc8XAXEC9eg,My favorite Presidential bout is still the original - Romney vs Obama.
dc8XAXEC9eg,The hatians in Springfield is a horrible thing. Its just one part of their plan to completely change the demographic of our country. No more immigrants period.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"13:00 other reasons she gets called a marxist is because her propised solution to inflation is banning price gouging and instituting price controls, which are policies that communist governments have pursued. She also is nore extreme on gun control and has said she believes we should distribute wealth based on equity."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Trump absolutely won the ERB, he was hilarious, but I pray every hour of every day he doesn't win the actual election"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I always appreciate your inbiased approach to these things. This was a good one. Bull Moose party for the win once again.
dc8XAXEC9eg,I like that Teddy Roosevelt was riding a moose. His party was called the Moose Party.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I read the title and thought, yep. Me too buddy. I feel like I'm breaking down too! Can't wait for this to be over."
dc8XAXEC9eg,I think it's cowardly that this dude won't formally endorse a candidate. Irresponsible
dc8XAXEC9eg,im sure this battle didnt sway anyone's opinion...
dc8XAXEC9eg,"He didnt make fun of the disabled reporter, you can look up videos of him doing that arm motion talking about Ted Cruz"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"14:26  Is there any case of a Democrat that is widely considered to be a good president by both sides? I can actually think of a number of old Republican politicians that Democrats speak well of (which, to be fair, some people will say the parties ""swapped"" so maybe its easier for Dems to see good in Republicans when Republicans were the progressive party).

My first thought was JFK because of all the Qanon content that seemed to be wrapped up in the Kennedys, but maybe that's just by virtue of them being the Kennedys (it helps they are also New York socialites and so of course Trump would have known JFK Jr just from sort of hanging around the same-ish scenes) but the more I think about it the more Im doubtful that a majority of current Republicans would have anything to do with a Catholic war-mongerer, though I suppose as tends to be the case with Kennedy, he gets a bump in people's memory because of his death. 

You could try to go back to before the so called ""swap"" (I know it wasn't really a swap, it's just the easiest way to references the time period where the two major parties underwent some serious evolution/growth and change) to when Democrats tended to be a more Conservative coalition up against the Radial Lefty Republicans. However, I feel like there is something of a tell where Republicans tend to celebrate older, pro-swap Republicans as if they're on the same team, while happily dismissing Democrats from this period as being horrible. And they're largely right, a lot of them are kind of terrible. It's one of the reasons I think Republicans tend to be more included to claim there WAS no swap (and again, that is a huge simplification for what actually did happen, but regardless the parties HAVE changed their positions on a number of policies throughout are history and more importantly, one has moved towards being more progressive while the other begins to slowly sort of become more traditionalist) which.... I mean, its something that's so easy to disprove yet I hear it all. The. Time. Like, I get that Lincoln and Roosevelt were awesome, but they were also fairly progressive and you think that would be enough to put off the kind of real deep Republicans that are likely to go around defending."
dc8XAXEC9eg,3:32 Trump also said that one of the voting booths wasn't letting people vote for him - like the computers in one state wouldn't let you click on his name or something - I thought it could maybe be a reference to that as well - whether its true or not I don't really know.
dc8XAXEC9eg,PINEAPPLE PIZZA ROCKS EH!🍁🍁🍁🍁🍍🍍🍍🍍🍕🍕🍕🍕😈😈😈😈
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I know Chris(VTH) doesn't like Trump, and his against him, but I think tis kinda out of the bag now. It doesn't hurt to address it imho."
dc8XAXEC9eg,Cant wait for more historical and educational content!
dc8XAXEC9eg,Id love to see Teddy fight trump lol
dc8XAXEC9eg,12:00 technically it's Columbus geese.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"I dont understand why they would bring up classified documents in this song, when Biden was also hit with classified documents from when he was vice president under obama. Which i personally would think is a bigger problem than a president having those documents when they have the power to declassified and a vice president dosent. But this whole thing with documents shows a bigger problem that should be investigated with all politicians because we shouldn't be having the biggest leaders leaving these documents wherever and since people under them tend to follow their leaders it should be safe to assume there is bigger violations against both sides. I'm worried that since we haven't heard anything new than that likely means no one is looking into it. That worries me."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"watch the end as well after the credits, two former presidents make an appearance!"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Vote Blue.
dc8XAXEC9eg,Roosevelt won.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"""And if your racist landlord daddy wasn't dead it would kill him seeing me live rent-free in your head"" Trump's verses were better overall but that one line just made him lose."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"5:55 ""where it's believed""? Seriously? There's still debate?"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Their Ground News ad at the end of the video is great and I think it would have been a fun reaction at the end
dc8XAXEC9eg,I wish I had friends🥲
dc8XAXEC9eg,"""sucks the least"" too true"
dc8XAXEC9eg,Trump did NOT mock a reporter for his disability.  He always used those arm movements when insulting people regardless of physical capabilities
dc8XAXEC9eg,"As an undecided voter and with how much time is left before election day, I think I'll make up my mind based on this rap battle."
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Hey Chris! Love the channel. I would love to see you do some reactions to HipHughesHistory. He’s responsible for making me fall in love with history way back in high school, but is never really talked about nowadays. Maybe he was a bit ahead of his time. His videos are really surface level, but were an awesome introduction to history for me!"
dc8XAXEC9eg,I like this guy.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"6:05 It's technically more correct to say that the Coronaviridae family has been around since forever. When it comes to Sars-cov2 it's clear that it has no connection with the first Sars, so it's not like Covid-19 was a new strain of an already human-infecting virus. It was it's own thing, probably common in an animal reservoir before comings into contact with us (with maybe an intermediary step into the wuhan lab, but that wouldn't really be necessary)"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"3:00 that is a lie. Trump never made fun of someone based on their disability. It was a lie pushed by media but was shown to be a lie 

7:25 “ you been bending American decency over a barrel” then you say true. How? It isn’t true when you look at the events going on around both parties

7:36 trump didn’t just have classified documents laying around they were protected by Secret Service in a vault what was shown to be the case but the FBI has admitted to staging pictures with classified documents that they brought with them.

8:40 Kamala Harris wasn’t present during January 6 it has been shown to be untrue

10:10 it doesn’t matter what race she is but it does matter when she uses it to try and buy votes with emotions when she had always said she was Indian never black but switched to look good. So yeah it does matter with how you manipulate the situation.

11:00 stormy daniel literally said she made up the story. You can look it up, may take a bit to find since it was buried but not hard. Also there isn’t just one video of pets being eaten there is a lot, as well as reports so it isn’t fake and it is happening factually. Also it is being doing against the law because it’s illegal immigrants.

Did you really say that he, the past and most likely future president shouldn’t respond to people calling him racist? He has to, it is during a election with people trying lie to push him out

13:00 no she gets the label because she wants marxist policies like price control which she has pushed. What is Marxist.

14:00 no that isn’t what it has been trump stopped wars from start, boosted the economy more then any modern president, lowered crime and put tighter control on evil counties trying to destroy the country. He even was elected for Nobel Peace prize for his work in the middle East and Korea. He was the first president ever to cross the demilitarized zone into north Korea Kore. So no he wasn’t the “ least bad “ he was a damn good one with a great record and plan."
dc8XAXEC9eg,The plot of Weekend at Burnie's also included how the boss was going to have the pair murdered by the mob to cover up his embezzlement. Burnie also wrote a fake suicide note and I believe the hitman shows up to re-murder Burnie.
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Oh you just opened up a can of worms,! Forget politics, pineapple on pizza! Fck yeah I say, If anyone says fruit doesn't belong  on a pizza, wtf do you think a tomato is is? It's not a fckin vegetable."
dc8XAXEC9eg,As a Trump voter no real swaying to me.
dc8XAXEC9eg,She was actually NOT there when all that stuff went down January 6. She left hours before. She lied wen she implied she was. This is all a matter of record.
dc8XAXEC9eg,He looks like robert Downey junior in some angles
dc8XAXEC9eg,"What's really crazy about this election, if you took away everyones sensitve feelings and 10 years of all media outlets saying trump is a ""bigot, racist, sexist, and whatever else"" and actually broke down individual policies or ideas, strenth as a leader and not crying about a comment or joke someone said, this wouldnt even be a close election, trump would win in a landslide.

Everyome votes with their hurt feelings now, and the idea that abortion seems to be the number one issue in the country is actually insane. It shouldn't even be in the top 5"
dc8XAXEC9eg,"Worth reminding folks, because the media lied, he never mocked a reporter FOR his disability. He made a gesture he had used when mocking many different people and it was misinterpreted as mocking a disability. But people who only saw the 2 second clip and not other clips for context got the wrong idea."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The body cam footage of the women eating a cat and had blood all over face and admitted she eat the cat others said they saw her eat the cat she is American there is body cam.footage of it and they didn't come from Haiti and the utuber who says he came from Haiti said that this is what our people do it's for luck and keeps bad ju ju away he clearly was doing it for clicks I haven't seen one video of anyone but Americans a local hurt any animals it's definitely bs 😂😂😂🙏
QBZfKfKw1Uc,10:19 Whats up now about that dog walk preach EY we fucking won 😂😂😂😂😂😂
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I know they used playgrounds as toilets in the 80s
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Trump 2024 baby
QBZfKfKw1Uc,This is one of those moments when people from the right hate on certain groups but then will be for those certain groups when its necessary like for votes and support. They done it to muslims and its no different to British conservatives and far right members
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Where did trump said it was haitians? timestamp pls to show a fren
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Ye, i aint anti trump but this story was so weird lol"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The irony is the governor who's part of the Republican party supports the Hatian immigrants that are here in Ohio.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"There really isn’t any good choice in the presidential pick, both have some serious issue"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"If Trump is going to be racist, at least get the stereotypes right, everyone knows eating dogs and cats is an Asian stereotype, not a Haitian or black stereotype. No but seriously though that was hilarious 🤣."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Damn im disappointed. I use to really rock with yall when yall was much more unbias, even if i didnt agree. This whole video is disingenuous."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Why did you use AI art?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,There where Ohio residents complaining about this at a town hall meeting weeks before trump said anything and footage of it but of course no one cared til trump said something and the mainstream left media took it and spent it to make it sound like racist bs for political gain
QBZfKfKw1Uc,https://youtu.be/uPEkg3SEiNo?si=Tx_D7gWGfpm27H_L
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"But hatians do eat cats in Haiti.. you can buy cat meat and live cats at stores there.. That's a fact. It's common there. So, to say hatian immigrants are eating cats here, in america, it's not that much of a stretch."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"This Video has an oddly low view count. Does it have to do with ""Trump"" being in the title?"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"these 2 clowns are the avg Kamala voters, yes they are eating the dogs and cats"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Aba hates on indians and has to re-edit a bunch because his disdain is obvious- youve straight up lied about them in one video, in another you said ""Indians smell like sh!t and Canadians are nice""- wierdo Aba is a hypocrite."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I think it's funny that some people are red pilled and attack other minority groups but when the mob finally goes after their group they say this is wrong we shouldn't do this and it's a lie, hopefully he'll teach people to be more sympathetic but I doubt it"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"@AbaNPreach 

https://youtu.be/EQ_q7DFeucY?si=oWaSvDcgz_Av-RZJ"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I am so disappointed on both of you guys.. 🐔👎🏼
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"All of this cats and dogs bs aside, a town with a population of less than 60k people, gaining 20k immigrants in less than 4 years is insane... That's the real issue, and this is distracting people from talking about it. It's honestly impressive how effective the media is at being divisive."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The most useless channel on the internet
QBZfKfKw1Uc,independent news outlets such as Tyler Oliveira have interviewed those in Springfield and have confirmed the cat dog and geese hunting and eating
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Bro! He never said haitian  Specifically
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Aba why tf can u never be serious when preach talking man??? When u talk the man lets u say ur peace.. why u trying to be funny your not..
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"LMFAO I came back just to fkin gloat cuz i knew this would age bad, why and how you might ask? Cuz if you watch ANYTHING beyond mainstream media, you can LITERALLY find videos of Hatian immigrants GRILLING cats/dogs and even rodents. But you don't watch anything except mainstream media, you can't, you're Canadian and your government probably doesn't let you. That being said, have you been keeping up with topic lately? Any more news on if people's pets are going missing? Wants some clips for content so you can walk back your goofy arse take? No? Meh, didn't think so.  Just cash that check and move on lmao"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,“I was tryna scratch my leg…”😂
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"In mexico is like the lottery, you might never know when one of your tacos had some of that woof meat."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Just because government officials are denying it, it doesn't mean the ordinary people who are living with this are lying."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Only one correction here: 
The infamous story about a man eating a homeless man's face off because of bath salts didn't actually include bath salts. On top of that, he was African American. He only had weed in his system, but he was known to have mental issues and could have had form of schizophrenia that the weed didn't interact well with. I, personally, consider his case an anomaly because of the legitimate fanfair behind the attack. White people, reasonably so, are more affiliated with meth, mostly because of mug shots and D.A.R.E."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Commenter- i mean but we do have a problem with the haitians moving there.

Oh cool so I can lie about people in order to bring attention to another issue.

""They are so focused on the pet topic because in white American culture beastiality happens alot"""
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Where was trump getting dog walked by Kamala exactly??
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I think its disingenuous of you to trim a portion of the video, in the full video he corrected himself and clearly said that making the story get headlines not makeup the story. I think he accepted what the host said without first fully comprehending the statement and he corrected himself. But its also true that its not alright to lie about the Haitians and taking illegal turns."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Trump never said hatian people were eating cats and dogs.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"hold up, how can you say that is true in canada when they mostly fabricated the buried indigenous children under schools"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"The issue is lying and putting the wrong race to the story, and using it against a whole group of people.

There are mass migration issues, but muddying the waters with fake stories(real story, wrong nationality lol) doesnt do anything positive."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I’d have to see the videos of what happened in the neighborhood.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Trump’s a clown. Vance wears eyeliner.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Bro there's actual videos of them eating these animals raw and sacrificing them
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Join the asian side my brotha 😂🤝✊️
QBZfKfKw1Uc,*I wouldn’t be surprised that they’re stealing and killing pets not to eat but for Voodoo magic.*
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Are you going to do a video of all the lies that come out of Harris’ mouth or is this just a one sided thing?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I knew people were going to be SPAMMING ""HEY. HAITIAN GUY! TALK ABOUT HAITI. TALK ABOUT IT NYYYAAAAOOOOW REEEEEEEEE"". But hey thanks for actually doing it haha"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,No chance i'm voting for trump man
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Trump making fake news lol
This guy has no end to his bs 😂"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Trump's VP admitted to being fake news
QBZfKfKw1Uc,i still think the woman eating a cat is still something that should not be overlooked we hitting crazy territory where african american woman was arrested for eating a cat with neighbors watching what the hell and based on the video she had to be on something with how she could barely respond to anything
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The US. Needs to keep their promises to the American Indians before it spends money on anyone else after telling the American Indians it doesn’t have enough money to fully abide by the Treaties that were made.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,This rumor was technically spread and perpetuated by the media
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Conservatives and republicans are so dumb and easily mislead bro.This situation has been fact checked and debunked numerous times.If its real why haven't any of the people who ""witnessed"" it come out on social media or in the news to say anything.If its true why don't conservatives use those videos for proof.Oh i know cause they are none.If its true why did JD Vance admitted it was a lie on national television?"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,AnP on that misinformation tip I see
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Ik y’all seen that boy with the goose man y’all know they tore up. He was bout to have thanksgiving with that mf
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I missed the part where he said he created? He said “if I gotta create stories to get y’all to pay attention” like it’s sad basicslly. 

L"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Are we going to get a video about the migrants murdering children or nah?  Cats and dogs are more important? If so, my man has a point."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Duck duck goose.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Aba hold still.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Why are people leaving comments on here saying “ watch the whole interview” as if watching the whole interview makes any difference. He basically says in the interview he created a story to draw attention to the problem that is going on in Springfield. The rest of the interview does not say that he didn’t lie!
QBZfKfKw1Uc,This is the type of person some people are willing to vote into the White House.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,10:20 preach lost aura here I'm sorry
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Aba and Preach were cool with fake stories of Indian immigrants in Canada.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,9 states also do the same
QBZfKfKw1Uc,🙌🏾
QBZfKfKw1Uc,SHOW THE FULL CLIP!!!!!!!!
QBZfKfKw1Uc,FUCKING LIARS!!!!!!! Watch the full video and post the full clip!!  Most people won't even bother to look up the interview so thanks for spreading misinformation.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,*Haitians* >title
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Americans aren't really idiots,, they're just misinformed"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"the Hatian people in that town were asked to come by the town to help boost the economy .Also it is actually about 3,000  Haitians NOT 30,000 . Why not actually look at the facts and not believe the bullshit . Corporate Media makes money through sensationalizing  & both siding  a story . Nazi loving Republikkkans lie ."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,You really need to start talking about this fool Tariq Nasheed
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"9:00 TRUEEE even the lie makes no sense man

They’re literally in the Midwest you telling me they don’t have mf’in farm animals around they can pretend are getting killed instead? “Oh yeahhh hatians ate my cow bro just ignore all that freshly frozen meat in that chest freezer” is way more believable than “oh they ate my house cat”."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Idk 🤷🏾‍♀️ let’s see how it plays out. I just know Kamala is lying and fronting
QBZfKfKw1Uc,There are people in Haiti eating dirt. Its not farfetched that they would eat dogs and cats
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"As a person who has seen what Haitians are capable of, this is definitely not a created story and even if it is (which I doubt), I simply have no pity for these people."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Too bad theres evidence, police reports, body footage, ect....soooo"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,So you chose to lie rather than stating the facts that you have??? Why does he think like this?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Y’all playing right into trumps hand. Focusing on the madness of his statement. He said that about Haitians in order to get out of the topic of why he said “ kill the bill” to republicans that were voting on a bill to fix immigration. Just rewind the clip of his statement 10 minutes and you’ll see
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Side note...

The Western obsession with delineating types of animals that can he pets vs farm animals is just hypocritical.

Especially as it has nothing to do with the animals intelligence (we eat some of the most intelligent animals)

The issue is only if you steal someone's pet, not if you eat an animal considered by others as the type of animal they consider a pet.

Unless you're vegan stfu, and even then..."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Big ups for speaking out on this BS. People forget the Haitian HIV scare of 1990 and how we were abused and used as scapegoats.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"You guys took an L on this just for not playing that full JD Vance clip. He clarified the meaning of his statement right after. He didnt mean that he made a fake story. What he meant was putting it in the eyes of the media. He even wrote it on his X when CNN and other MSM tried to say he just made it up.

Haitians don't eat cats?
There are videos Haitians eating and killing cats in Haiti on X. One of them even has a Hatian guy is teaching people how to prepare it on camera.

Also, you have people like that guy named Barbecue eating people in Haiti right now. I just saw a video of a Haitian eating meat off a person's leg during their current civil war.

When it comes to driving, the Haitians are crashing into cars and buildings left and right with video footage in Ohio. One guy even hit a bus and killed a kid. I am sorry, but these 15 million migrants and ""asylum seekers"" that this administration has just just let come to America have got to go back. Donald Trump has my vote. They can go back home, or we can send them to Canada with y'all."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"All i gotta say is this some ""all men"" mentality. It just adds more truth to the fact that most gender issues are solvable from the abolition of generalization in this specific setting."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Some haitians do eat cats and yes dog meat is sold in port au prince markets to pass off as goat... but anyways yes they might not be stealing people's pets ..but yes haitians do eat cat... do your research well before coming and saying that they dont..
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I live in Little Haiti in Miami Florida. I work in Little Haiti in Miami Florida. My first husband is half Haitian meaning my son has Haitian I know. I know Haitians and been around Haitians my whole life and never once have I seen a Haitian trying to eat a cat or a fucking dog now they do fuck up some fish though.😂
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I didn't hear him say Haitians. Aba and preach fell off
QBZfKfKw1Uc,What a disgusting thing to say. SMH
QBZfKfKw1Uc,It doesn't matter. We have a huge illegal immigration crisis.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"“This is what I think, people don’t really care about truth. They really only care about care about information that really really rings well or whatever and whatever is true they don’t care about.” That sums up this whole video. This whole take at best is disingenuous, at most likely it’s completely false and a lie. You guys couldn’t do the work to find out if this is actually true or not. You guys can pretend to be as unbiased and nuanced as you like but this is wrong. Not to mention the deleting comments thing is pathetic. You guys are going 100% sneako with this garbage. Keep going with those knee jerk reactions amigos"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Just so y'all know Kamala also lied her ass off
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"No one said, all haitians are eating cats and dogs stop lying."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"He said, ""If I had to create a stories, so that american media pays attention to the suffering of the American people.""

He never said he created any stories

Stop twisting people's words"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I grew up in Springfield, OH. I could believe the population decline because it is a smaller town and most of what younger generations want to do first thing is get out of their small town. I did. The influx of Haitians has been happening over the last 4 or so years. While it does have its major cultural hiccups and logistical issues that would come from an influx like that, it is what the city needed. Many people have their frustrations and they are legitimate in some cases, but there are many more that people are just using to vent racist and xenophobic rhetoric they already held. The biggest issue is that in Trumps camp of fear-mongering, they don’t care about how it may affect people who are TAX PAYING LEGAL CITIZENS who came here for a better life just like their ancestors and the ancestors of many others. At this point there are people who just associate “immigrant” with “illegal” automatically. And just like January 6th, is there any responsibility for the discourse that has been taken on his words by him? No, and he never will because of its a bad thing it’s never his fault. Not when his cult stormed the capital, not when he disbanded the pandemic response department of the cdc right before Covid dropped, and not when bomb threats are being called into schools and hospitals over this lie they spread. My father works in a hospital and my mother is a teacher. Both are immigrants. This nonsense has to stop."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,W video.🔥
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"The woman who tried to eat the cat was an American woman from Canton, Ohio 120 miles away. The republican mayor, the republican governor and the republican sheriff, all said this was a lie. The woman who started this whole thing, caucasian terrorists Erica Lee started this rumor and now claims she is afraid for her biracial child and that she is not racist and lbgt+. Springfield is part of the ""KKK Corridor"" in Ohio, where anything between Columbus and Cleveland is considered klan country(I live in southwest Ohio so yeah, I know). This is JD Vance's senatorial region. By the way, the only people working in Springfield or building businesses or cleaning up old dilapidated houses are the Hatian community because everyone else there is getting government assistance because of heroin or meth."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The rumor comes from a nazi group called blood tribe lol
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Both sides sadly put out informations that arouses your emotions.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I've got a MAGA friend who will wholeheartedly spew nonsense such as: Biden opened the border, Oklahoma City and 9/11 were inside jobs, and the Clintons were part of the Iran Contra scandal and both are CIA assets."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Dang 2:01
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Trump was already a joke and adding Vance as VP just made it even worse. Not only is Vance a fucking idiot but I get evil vibes from him. He's probably been the one stealing and eating people's pets lol
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Hahaha... lashes out against Indians on that Spaniard issue by maligning the whole country and now deflecting your people's issues


Sit this one down 
😂🖕🖕🖕"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I'm confused. Even if this were true, how is it relevant to the American election? 😂 if someone in another country wants to eat some weird shit, who cares"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I'm late but I'm seeing all these people weighing in from Ohio. The alledged video of a woman eating a live cat is not something any foreigner would do, that's some crazy high on bath salts shit. Don't blame your weird Ohio shit on foreigners.

I will say, other countries do eat cats and dogs, but they're not eating them like goblins in somebody's yard. They're farmed and sold in markets like any other meat. My ex lived in Madagascar for 2 years and he ate cat in meals lol. That does not mean they're doing that here and it doesn't mean anybody steals people's pets anywhere else. People eat bugs in other countries too, get over it"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Aba and Preach definitely missed the mark in this video
QBZfKfKw1Uc,People testified in front of their council members about their animals going missing amongst the other issues illegal immigrations is causing. Tons of videos on it soooo… bottom line 20k Haitians shouldn’t be dumbed in a town of 60k period…
QBZfKfKw1Uc,My husband is Haitian - the cat eating story is a stereotype that has been mentioned before about his community. It’s so f*cked up that people can be so easily mislead 🙄🙄
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Honestly surprised Harris was able to contain herself. I would’ve been in a laughing fit.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I'm taking those who actually live out there word for it over you. No offense.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDDMGC4NzNY&ab_channel=ForbesBreakingNews proof
QBZfKfKw1Uc,that's a spiritual war you guys don't get it
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"What about the video where a black lady was saying a house of hatian immigrants killed her cat and hung it in her backyard like a pig to drain the blood. Also the hearing in springfield black people complained about hatians driving crazy and killing animals on the street. Im just saying dont make it sound like its a race fight or a political device when theres people that dont give a f*** about which fake elector is gonna be president, they just care about whats actually going on. Shit was going on before trump was tryong to say so. I get everything is political"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I thought it was black people saying all this about hatians in a hearing. Idk why its gotta be about race now.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Sending love to the Haitian community. I'm sorry you have to go through this disaster of a presidential candidate and vp and used as a scapegoat. We hope we can all move on with President Kamala and put this nightmare behind us.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"You all ignored the super obvious cut at 1:24. Great work guys, this video sucks because your information sucks."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Im pretty sure he said the asian people are eating dogs
QBZfKfKw1Uc,There’s hella evidence fellas. Sorry Preach. Haitians eat dogs and cats. Spin it how you want to make you feel cozy and safe. Truth sucks sometimes.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,This video won’t age well… I think this is an L
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The Haitian community should apologise to the Chinese community for stealing their dog eating stereotype.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"How about watching the whole video before just shooting your mouths off. He misspoke, he corrected himself and said that he was creating awareness about what he was being told by his constituents."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"The hodge twins just showcased a video of a black lady crying cuz she found the head of her dog in her yard, supposedly killed by the homeless immigrants.   Lots of people are legitimately supporting this idea now.  Not sure what to believe"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,A lot of racists justifying their racism here.  I find it tactless and disgusting.  Haitians don’t eat cats and dogs.  That’s not even a thing.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I didn't believe it until they said it was Hatians. They still practice voodoo and canibalism there. Haiti is cooked.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,You guys realise that this has actually been happening... Are you actually living on purpose?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,He didn’t say Haitians did I miss something?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Preach needs to make that a single. 😅
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Anyone remember when the media declared the canabalizm and start mentioning about the Rebel leader named BBQ...insinuating that he be eating people..
QBZfKfKw1Uc,These thumbnails are GETTING OUT OF HAND
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"People will believe anything and this is proof. Bro lied on national television about Haitians and the other failed to answer a single question proplery without mentioning that she comes from a middle class family and that she works super hard.  VP Harris said during the debate that she is all for gun owners protecting their rights because she owns guns, and then changes her opinion LITERALLY in the next sitdown interview she does with ABC news. One makes up stories about Haitians eating ' the cats and the dogs' and the other cant remain consistent on her political views. One is currently in office and the other one got impeached. That should tell you everything. But wait, there's more....Trump is a convicted 'fellon' and Harris is the current VP.. This aint reality tv. This shit is real life, and it's fucking sad bro."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56jgn4cz4v0
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"That's wild though, because I heard the people  that are coming in.. Not Haitians..
Are y'all extending the truth?"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,What happened to not your country not your problem imma need you to stop talking about this. I actually live im ohio and people has call the cops over pets being eaten. So he really didn't make it up . But im going to go there to see if its really happening. And Haitian have killed a few people while driving. You didn't even show the full clip because you know he said that.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The story is real. Another L take from you about American problems. How about just stay in Canada and mind your business?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Oh my God are you talking about eating other animals leave our animals alone play narcissist psychopaths social path
QBZfKfKw1Uc,The only ones that emotional or the girly man's reporting people has bullies when it's saying the truth about your people
QBZfKfKw1Uc,What about all of the videos of Springfield residents at town hall meetings stating that they were? It’s so hard to tell what is true anymore
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"In a serious country, if a politician went on TV and shamelessly admitting to ""creating stories"" (AKA lying) to garner media control, that would be the end of their political career, no questions asked..."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Trump has been watching too many reruns of Alf.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,They need to stop lying on people.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I got two trump ads after this video...
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Had a Haitian neighbor, or African, couldn't tell, MF was dark as shit lmao. He had a Pet piglet that would normally escape and run up the street. Little did anyone know he was actually raising that thing to be slaughtered and eaten. I thought it was a pet personally cuz it had a Bow on it. Guess he was just preparing to Gift wrap it for Charons Next lunchable?"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Aba and preach once again youre wrong. They are eating the pets and kicking people out of their homes. Bad take again unfortunately.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Eating dogs, maybe, dogs are too friendly... Aint no Haitian catching a cat tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"You’re missing the point. The point isn’t JUST immigrants bringing their culture we see as taboo, because regardless of what the media will say, it is happening, it has happened, and it’s common practice in other cultures around the world; it’s about the migration of tens of thousands of people that we have no clue about. They’re coming to America off the backs and dimes of AMERICANS and they bring their culture along with them. They’re not bothering to assimilate in ANY WAY. Alongside their weird cultural practices, like eating cats and dogs, they’re bringing unprecedented amounts of crime. This is the game the media will play, make a big laugh out of the story that sounds funny and ridiculous, even though it’s actually happening, but ignore the bigger picture, and unfortunately it’s fooling many Americans. The ones who won’t be fooled are the ones who are being adversely affected by immigrants and the crime they bring, the resources they take away from, the schools they render useless, and the taxpayer money they siphon away."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,👁️👄👁️
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Hum cat actually taste good, need an alcohol Haitian to do it for you. Not sure why but when they do it especially with alcohol it’s crazy good."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"There’s Haitian immigrants in Tijuana, Mexico and for all the years they were there no one complained about them eating cats or dogs. When Trump was saying this we all knew it was bullshit."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"😂😂""you good"""
QBZfKfKw1Uc,i'm still trying to understand why did he create that random story on a fucking live debate!?what was the goal?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Any true Haitian knows that Haitian don’t even like pets! Like my parents! 😂
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Hey why not reporter on msnbc publishing a story they knew was fake about a dr. conducting unauthorized hysterectomy on migrant woman in custody? smh at least try to balance the ship, again or not it's your channel."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,You guys are super left now. I wonder if the Harris campaign gave you two a the bag. You guys were always a neutral channel but this year you guys went super left I've noticed
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Lmaooooo I feel stupid that I live an country that this is a topic in a national presidential debate
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I mean there are other things besides school shooters that get generalized about white people too. Everyone generalizes about everyone that’s why we have stereotypes. Most stereotypes are just wrong
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Oof, some these comments are so awful and ignorant. I guess I should have expected it, but I didnt realize so much of your audience was red. 😂"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Are you guys going to make a video apologizing for getting this wrong since theres clear video of a cat being grilled by africans in ohio. And interviews with the witnesses and video of the grill?
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"People only care about the truth insofar as it confirms to their bias and preconceived notions.

Any truth or fact that deviates from that they consider fake news. 

That’s the maga creed. Reality is what I believe it to be, not what it is."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Yes! Call him out! He admitted he made up stories
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Preach Sing 😂
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"You know what burns me the most with this?

Say there _are_ certain immigrants, not from one specific group, stealing and eating pets, now, that isnt going to be discussed because instead, we're too busy doing this crap!

Had vance and Trump specifically talked about those who came in illegally, rather than once again, trying to put the blame on whoever is behind the Blue podium, this being Kamala with her ""open border policies"" then MAYBE there could be an actual discussion!
But nope! Instead, this is the hill that those worthless stains have decided to die on. 
(Them being those who tout this obvious lie, while trying to inject it into other similar talking points, and Vance for fabricating this)"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Have we forgotten that in the beginning of the pandemic social media was flooded with Asian people eating snakes and frogs etc. What I've noticed on social media, especially under a cultural culinary video where the dish is from a country, people from other countries flock the comments to question the tase, the preparation, the way the food was cook etc. BUT exclude the thought of considering that people from different countries have a different history which ISN'T LIMITED TO; how they socialize, how they dress, foods they eat, music etc. Now you have issues where immigrants are needed for specific purposes yet a smear campaign is what being fed against them at the same time."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Had to like the vid for the on point K-Ci and JoJo singing
QBZfKfKw1Uc,6:32  thats a ridiculous  headline or news article. that's why I don't watch the flipping  news from start to finish  anymore
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Abby and preach need about to takk about the canabalism part cause what the hell
QBZfKfKw1Uc,1:33 bruhh why is there 2 thick shadow lines above her eyes like shes wearing a mask? Like the thickness of the shadow line is big enough to slide a pinky in the shadow line above her eyes
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Trump's VP is a zionist. They are terrible people. Simple.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Wow! So crazy the people are calling you misinformed for pointing out an obvious lie. People really believe anything Trump says it's the truth
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Normally I relate to nearly everything ya'll say, but this one I think ya'll been in Canada too long. I don't think yall know what the hell's going on in America. There is video of these people doing this stuff so.
 I think preach needed to talk to his elders about some of the stuff that old school hatians do before commenting. Because maybe you aint doing it but.  Yes some people over here doing this stuff. I know its inconvenient and hurtful but facts is facts my guy.😅 https://youtu.be/765q0PH2Ezg?si=y0jUgZcPq5sng3d4"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,We seen the videos cuh it’s cooked
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Never seen any of this ever lol tuff tuff
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"To be fair, that clip was selectively edited to imply something without full context. I mean, you can say that he had a Freudian slip moment and that's 100% your prerogative but editing the clip as through it is proof that he admitted to creating the story/narrative is disingenuous and misleading.  The full interview is 17 minutes long, I suggest ppl watch it in its entirety before saying that he made up the entire thing as is implied in this response video. Also, I'm not attacking Aba N Preach's credibility either with this comment. Perhaps they didn't watch the entire clip or perhaps they did and formed the same opinion. I'm just saying to watch the entire clip and think for yourselves."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"That was the stupidest way to phrase it, but he said ""I made it a story"" or whatever and not ""I made it up"". He didn't start the rumor, and I'd be more likely to believe it wasn't happening if anyone who insisted it isn't happening actually admitted they have no more proof than anyone else or didn't immediately claim everything was ""made up by racists"".

This has the same trappings of everything else that gets called ""-ist"" of some sort, legitimate concerns that aren't actually based on race/color/gender/whatever get dismissed by corporate media as conspiracy/racism/sexism/whatever."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Thats the issue with treating the ""Immigration Crisis"" discourse at face value as valid. Its been hijacked by rascists who are too scared to say slurs on social media. ""Mexicans"" is shorthand for you know who, and Haitians are shorthand for you know who. Same with ""DEI"" as a tool to discredit minorities with prestigious positions."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Keep messing with these Haitians. These mofos don't know hatians well.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,there is a video of a haitian trying to steal cats from a home in chile
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"The more I watch this video, the more annoyed I get. 

Bro, research better next time. Let the video play out, dont be so quick to take people out of context."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"L Take. Why cut it? What Vence meant is if they have to amplify a meme to get the media to talk about immigration, they will. 

Bad faith interpretation."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"There's a guy on here, he's a musician. He made a a remix of Trump's foolishness. Hella funny!"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"well, Haitian refugees in Mexico are doing great, many have chosen to stay in Mexico, instead of going to America, they have found jobs already, learning Spanish from Government programs and enjoying life. For those that haven't found a place to stay they are sharing the provisional refugee camps with other migrants. No news about them eating pets but the thing is we Mexicans wouldn't care, and we also have markets with supplies for practicing their religion."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"⚠️ Meanwhile...... hillbillies have pet Pigs &   eat 🥓  Bacon at the same time, where's the story on that!?????"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,So quick to bandwagon this. L
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"What is so sad is that there is a photo of one of their candidates actually eating a dog, but nothing to see here people because he is white. Don't take my word for it. Google JFK Jr. eating dog somewhere in Asia."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,6:41 shock jocks
QBZfKfKw1Uc,It goes all the way back to Haiti breaking chains and stopping France slavery and since then the US led the attacks on Haiti because they didn't want the slaves in the US to revolt as well.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"The wildest part of this is that about half of Trump’s supporters believe this story is true, according to recent polling. I don’t know what’s sadder - the fact that half of them believe such bullshit, or the fact that half of them don’t but support him despite his lies"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"You missed the ""Cats & Dogs, Just Pearly Things"" opportunity"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I see why people don't want to get into politics. These political figures are full of shit on both sides (the left and the right)
QBZfKfKw1Uc,He didnt admit to creating anything. Fake news. You guys are dishonest af.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Wow guys. You are no better than the trash mainstream media. You totally cut off that clip of Vance where continued explaining that he didn't ""create"" the news story out of thin sure, but to draw attention to the issue that the media was ignoring. IE ""creating a news cycle"". Pretty common vernacular in the media space.  

AND you failed to show the hearings of all the locals who are complaining about this issue. 

Totally dishonest and despicable behavior from you two. I'm so disappointed in you."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,I’ve seen a video of a lady crying saying that it’s true and heard a call to the police of people taking geese. But people love to get clicks these days so who knows what is true anymore.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"People that are in the comments talking about how it was wrong to put that many immigrants in that town, did you all miss the part where they said the town was dying before those immigrants got there? Yes, it may have been a strain on the towns resources, but I would ask, if the town was dying, what resources? 
And fellas, only half of America have lost their standards, please don't get Democrats confused with Republicans. Everything Trump and Maga are doing, is for the sake of supremacy. That's why they don't care what he does or says, they see this as their one chance to get ahead of minorities again. All mainstream news channels, are owned by Republicans and that is why they haven't run any news about the Epstein files or anything else that would really hurt Trump, while pretending to be fair and balanced."
QBZfKfKw1Uc,*watches Preach desperately pretend like dogs aren't delicious*
QBZfKfKw1Uc,the scary thing is how many suckers are spreading this lie around. for some people if enough people say something they'll start believing it too
QBZfKfKw1Uc,4:05 data says otherwise.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Watch the town meetings before the debate nonesense.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,Haitians do eat cats
QBZfKfKw1Uc,They are eating the protected ducks tho.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,None of these politicians know about lugaos and it is apparent.
QBZfKfKw1Uc,https://youtu.be/765q0PH2Ezg?si=zADw2E0gyfJdg8iw
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Since people keep parroting the same debunked stories:
- crazy lady on rhe video was not an immigrant or Haitian 
- lady that told vance her cat was eaten by her neighbors found rhe cat alive in her basement...
- man carrying the geese works for the city and was recovering them after they got hit by a car"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"Remember when they said this was about illegals...

None of those Haitians are illegal... But it was NEVER how about legality.  It was there isn't always will be about race"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,People say the same thing about asians....
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I don't look too far into it. Haitians are the new Mexicans... or old ones... either way you back, baby"
QBZfKfKw1Uc,"I wouldn’t put it past a certain Canadian politician (not naming names) making claims of similar effect in Canada and mainstreaming this sort of rhetoric. Canadian politics is heading this way. There are a lot of aggrieved and petty people from certain demographics who will jump on the anti-immigrant, anti “woke”, “telling it like it is” nonsense. And the media will amplify it for clicks, circa US 2015…"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"agree with everything that was said, but Isnt this the same thing we do with all Media, not just comics and podcasters. The politicians use musicians and celebrities to sway the public's minds without having to answer or face hard questions. Hard for me to criticize just comics and podcasters over the identical behavior."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"To be fair, I did hear the whole Trump podcast with Joe. Trump was mostly talking about himself, but Joe did on occasion slyly asked him some challenging questions, to which Trump avoided and changed the subject."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Talk about kamalas rules and special treatment she demanded to have accomodated or she wont go on the podcast
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Seeing only one side, only bringing up tools when one of your favorite ones says something bad about orange man"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"heres a breakdown for you now post election

no one trusts the big media outlet anymore (both right and left), everyone actually gets MORE of their news thru tiktok, youtube, twitch (hasan, aidin ross, etc), podcasters, like celebs have VERY large followings whether we like it or not (haily welch/hawk tuah girl, andrew tate), and presidential candidates are learning to tap into these communities because they are a goldmine of audiences that may not be fully savvy to politics (ie, gen z who are not deep into or familiar with politics, but still strongly believe in feminism, racial issues, etc.).

if anything the danger of having podcasters in these kinds of circles is that they dont have the red tape that most news media have, though thats kind of hard to even state if thats true anymore now-a-days, but a great example is how the hell anyone think that joe rogan and trumps conversation about whales going crazy because of wind turbines is acceptable??

this has been years in the making, and its just the reality of us culture on politics now."
XgBVMwNHRgY,🥱👎🏾🥱👎🏾🥱👎🏾
XgBVMwNHRgY,Totally disagree with you on this one
XgBVMwNHRgY,Are celebs? Are news actors we call journalists?
XgBVMwNHRgY,It’s called getting lost in the sauce and all humans are prone to it
XgBVMwNHRgY,Im gonna go on the journalistic outlets to to talk about my curriculum... Stop bro just stop you sound brain dead
XgBVMwNHRgY,this is the melt down I wanted
XgBVMwNHRgY,"HAHA I did this so you should do it.. you lost.. you get nothing .. Good day, Sir!"
XgBVMwNHRgY,We getting a post election video? Seeing as how yall into USA politics now? 😅
XgBVMwNHRgY,"They are mistaken and are missing the point... There are many other voting blocks and segments out there, podcasting is only one segment of the voting block they reached."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Hope this US election helps Canadians finally get some sense and stop putting Trudeau in office.
XgBVMwNHRgY,All forms of entertainment are tools for propaganda.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"It really depends on what the goal of the podcast is. They are invited to talk, not to be interviewed. What is wrong about getting to know politicians on a more personal level? Podcasts are a great way for the audience to see that... 'What? A podcast brings a presidential candidate on when it's election year?? what??? political tools now?????' lol. I hope these, in turn, eventually turns into actual interviews, kinda like 60 Minutes."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Hey aba n preach weren’t the both of you tools for the DNC when you both stated that right wing YouTubers were taking money from Russia to get trump into office. How did that hoax work out? And I know you 2 aren’t from America and don’t care for our policies even though you made multiple claims about how Americans policies in the past.
XgBVMwNHRgY,Cus “world renowned journalist” are super biased😂 and have lost all credibility with working class Americans
XgBVMwNHRgY,That's an extremely dumb take. People just don't trust mainstream media anymore. Stfu about America you don't understand shit about American politics. Yall should be more worried about Canada and commie Justin.
XgBVMwNHRgY,Had to come back to this video to make my dislike was still there. Been watching yall for a few years and this is one of the few takes i completely disagree with.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I’m going to have respectfully disagree with you guys on this one. Podcasters may have been soft (which I agree I wish they spoke about facts over feelings) but our main stream media is definitely not better. We have a lot of taking things out of context, twist the narrative journalist and push their own agenda. They are definitely not more equipped."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Kamala had the same opportunity with rogan but didn't step up
XgBVMwNHRgY,"When ALL of corporate media favors the democratic party,  what other options are there.  Trump had already campaigned his ass off and we've seen how many hard interviews he did in the past for a fact.  It's the left who babies the candidates. Let's be intellectually honest"
XgBVMwNHRgY,Yep. Pretty much
XgBVMwNHRgY,It’s funny to hear you say that Abu and I totally agree but I kind of remember doing a pandemic when you all couldn’t speak on what you wanted to speak on because she was afraid of getting canceled. I remember you and preach slightly being a little indifferent on that aspect so that’s when I know the freedom of speech aspect was over with because if anyone wasn’t preaching what they wanted them to preach about COVID-19 it was shut up or you’ll be deleted and everybody fell in line for the most part
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I usually think you guys are either on the mark or near the mark, but I disagree with a lot of what you guys said here."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Totally agree dudes. They're lying to themselves or at least to their followers. And yes, they are followers."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"People trust podcasters now more, Joe and Elon are some of the last people keeping freedom of speech alive"
XgBVMwNHRgY,If you watch the Rogan trump interview Rogan asked him about different topics over 3 hours and he was pushing back and fact checking him. Rogan asked Kamala to come on but she refused because the max she could handle was 45 minutes
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Independent:
    Free from control: Not being ruled or controlled by another person or entity:
        An independent nation is not governed by another country
        An independent thinker is not influenced by others in their opinions or conduct

Come guys... There's a huge difference... Joe ain't no cuck or sellout. He has a view, a thought, a curiosity AND the freedom to promote whatever the hell he want's. Nobody has protested over the twerkers that rep the hasbin... they just ridiculed it. They can see the links, the shackles and the void of belief shilling. So what? It's campaign time ma bruvvas... If he wants to air political people, isn't that his right, due to his INDEPENDENCE? Artists and movie 'stars' shill for any damn thing they are either, A:told to or b: Payed for.

Independence! Where's the issue!?

BTW.. Tony was SO irrelevant to that platform. About as irrelevant as it gets. But again, so efin what if he states who he supports?

Love you guys but, yo, where is your balance? I see it non-present on this topic."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Kyle Kulinski always stressed that he doesn’t access sponsorships and he’s never talked to an advertiser. I love that so much because it gives him more freedom to say what he says on his channel. After watching him for 2 years, I haven’t noticed him express any sort of restraint or hesitation due to his fans."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Aba just be yapping. “World renowned journalist” are compromised by political bias and their respective media companies influence. Rogan said he wanted Trump AND Kamala on HIS terms. He did ask Trump difficult questions and you could tell when he was cagey. He even offered for Kamala to come and not talk about politics because no one even knew who she was. Aba be acting on his high horse all the time but won’t call out his friends like Destiny saying Trump supporters should be killed and shit.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"On independence... you have to respect Destiny, he has been very consistent"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"The new media has largely become mainstream, but with one crucial difference. There are no standards. Now, the standards is also what kept old MSM largely conservative and middle of the road, inoffensive... but it also kept some semblance of truth in there. The counter movement is to NOT be middle of the road, but actually throw any form of balance or standards out the window. And it shows."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"look at these two tools talking about tools. New show name, Hammer and Wrench."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Im confused. Isn't your critique of FNF that they violate YouTube terms and therefore deserve to be banned?! The reality is that compromises must be made when trying to make certain connections and moves
XgBVMwNHRgY,Trumps president  now so doesn’t matter 🥇😂people can cry Joe Rogan isn’t a tool especially when Kamala  didn’t wanna have a interview where she could be herself 😬
XgBVMwNHRgY,You guys act like the democratic party never goes after celebrity endorsements. It's all they do.
XgBVMwNHRgY,i like yalls videos but do ur research
XgBVMwNHRgY,You guys are deranged. MAGA.
XgBVMwNHRgY,Aba and preach have become liberal rage tubers
XgBVMwNHRgY,Aba is always jumping back in fourth between what jokes are acceptable vs not 😂 this guy has no real backbone about anything. Wish preach would speak up more instead of being a yes man to all this guys takes. Aba is a cuck. Makes sense why he’s so close with destiny and other grown adults who play video games and cosplay at their big ages 😂
XgBVMwNHRgY,"From the beginning it seems like there’s a misconception using the word “interview”. I didn’t watch the other ones so I’m not sure about those, but Rohan had a conversation with trump like he did with any other guest, and at least stated he wanted to do the same with Kamala. Specifically stating “it is not an interview”, that people want to get to know them and so he just wants to talk to them and let their personality be seen. Correlating that with broadcast news station media that has a lot of money and power to gain based on who wins, is a bit of a stretch"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"You have a great point Abba, politicians regardless of party need to be asked the serious questions and be kept accountable. 60 minutes is a bit too bias but interviews in that style should be the only ones politicians do. What good is it if we humanize them for them to turn around and dehumanize us with their policies?"
XgBVMwNHRgY,Thank you. I am so tired of republicans pretending like they don’t have someone they prefer or like or love in politics. Saying “oh they’re both politicians so I don’t trust them” then turning around and going to a trump victory party with their friend’s lol 😊
XgBVMwNHRgY,Well well well 🤔 yall got major ratiod this video wont age well the majority ppl are not with your leftist propaganda
XgBVMwNHRgY,I think your Trump derangement syndrome is showing. Basically you just called him and his supporters racist? You realize not just white people voted for him right?
XgBVMwNHRgY,"The comedian is a roast comedian.

And Puerto Rico has a literal trash problem. Why do y'all not do research?

And not all Puerto Ricans are mad. A lot of them were fine. 

Y'all are okay with trash talking people  you don’t like, but when a comedian that trash talks you mad? Weird."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Lol

You're mad that Trump made a great move?

He was asked to do podcasts. He said run them by Barron. Barron approved the list.

Trump is smart to know where to go to reach the right people. 

And it worked."
XgBVMwNHRgY,The indie is the new Mainstream…
XgBVMwNHRgY,Aba worst take. Mad L
XgBVMwNHRgY,u are not up here simpin for mainstream fake journalists i dont think you understand you are way more based in your normal opinions then you realize but  you habe been brainwashed lib
XgBVMwNHRgY,NO is the answer...we are hearing open dialogue and mainstream media is absolute garbage but im sorry you guys gotta be  libs if you trying this angle
XgBVMwNHRgY,Same same but diff diff lol
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Here's an idea. How about Aba and Preach go on the Joe Rogan show and talk to him about his decision? There you will get your answer, guys. Talk to Joe. I'm willing to bet he will welcome you to talk to him."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"You guys didn't even do base level research for this episode and it shows in the comments. I really respect a lot of your takes, but this is an L."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Money😊
XgBVMwNHRgY,Didn't Obama one time went on WWE? I have a distant memory that happened or maybe it was a fever dream
XgBVMwNHRgY,so ur mad theyre not digging up trumps past? its been done lets just move on? the comedians are def bias and will help all they can in the election. we got time now
XgBVMwNHRgY,These two Canadians need to start worrying about politics in their country. is  a sastring Canada.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"This one came across as a miss for me, i get what youre saying, hut youre just discussing biases. You guys have them as well"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I think Americans are devolving into their primal sensibilities where we are no longer living behind the facade of being reasonable and integral people; we are starting to be our tribal, vindictive, shallow, anti-intellectual selves. We are all just booty shakers."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Preach is so obviously salty crying about independent media softballing trump but ignoring the fact that mainstream media is softballing kamala and demonizing trump...

Crying about comedians promoting trump while saying nothing about star actors and singers (the whole Illuminati squad) promoting harris on live tv... Just get real man!"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Leftists when mainstream media demonizes right candidate and softballs left candidate: this is fine

Leftists when right candidate moves to independent media because mainstream is so obviously biased: crycrycry"
XgBVMwNHRgY,I love you guys…but try putting the same scrutiny on the other side. Obviously America is hurting and might be seeing something you don’t.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Where was this energy for Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard? Joe has had politicians on before, he even invited Kamala on but she wanted him to go to her and for the interview to be only 45mins, he wanted the interview to be a couple of hours. 
Honestly you guys sound salty as fck."
XgBVMwNHRgY,It felt like Rogan simply wants people to get to know these politicians. The future is Joe Rogan hiring investigative reporters and being his own news
XgBVMwNHRgY,HATERS!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I feel independent media is filtered to some degree. Mainly bc people subconsciously want to be seen as morally sound. As Shakespeare says it, the world is our own stage. 💯"
XgBVMwNHRgY,The jester can say what he wants to the king but at the end of the day he still serves the king and is going to do what the king says.
XgBVMwNHRgY,you guys are laaaaame . lame.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Not gonna lie, this is probably Aba’s  most pathetic take.   
I wonder how he feels about 
Trump’s Triumph…   We’ll never know."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I love everyone takes so much time to harp on a comedy set. Jokes are jokes, Tony is a comedian. Y'all say jokes are jokes then criticize the joke as if it's some serious commentary rather than just being a bad joke aimed at a specific demographic. I just couldn't imagine getting all riled up over something absolutely zero effect on me. Don't you two live in Canada? So this literally only affects you by proxy, or you're just choosing to let it affect you that much which is even funnier. People keep bringing that up and it's a tired ass conversation. Criticize actual narratives, not JOKES, which y'all were able to recognize multiple times"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"It’s a constantly shifting cycle. The independent media of today either dies out or get popular and corporatizes, then becomes the establishment, then will get crowded out by new up-and-comers. Business has worked this was already for a very long time. News is a business, so it’s gonna function the same way."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Trmp has successfully instilled mistrust between professional  journalism and the public.
XgBVMwNHRgY,every time a video of yours has shown up in my feed in the last few months its been an L take
XgBVMwNHRgY,13:00 - that is real. How can you be great the only direction you can punch is down? People are content to be the bully to feel better to avoid the hard work to make and encourage change.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"To be fair between money or ethics, most people go for money, because most people don't value respect all that much especially when compared to living a better life."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"i swear to god i'll show someone a recipe for a cake and they'll look at the top of the page, see ""The New York Times"", and say ""oooohh you read this sh*t bro? this just straight propaganda"""
XgBVMwNHRgY,Lot of college guys cited the Rogan podcast as a pull to vote for trump
XgBVMwNHRgY,Eh this takes a miss lol there’s a reason why Joe Rogan got that interview it wasn’t cause he’s a tool
XgBVMwNHRgY,"This video was so on point. When I saw reporters interviewing voters on election night say that a large number young male voters were citing Trump's Joe Rogan interview as THE reason they turned out for Trump, I finally came to terms with the mindset of this current generation. It's not about policy, a person's reputation, or their real-world actions - they're judging the candidate solely on that 2 hour window where they were having a jovial discussion with their favorite podcaster, and how successful that podcaster was at making them seem likeable and human."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Always have been Aba.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"It's actually funny to me how right rogan was when he said that elections are just popularity contests. They have pretty much been turned into a kind of roast where your candidate roasts their opponents, and now they have the comedians there, too. It won't surprise me when we start seeing live ads being read out loud at rallies. We are all just tools to be used by these people to get elected so they can gain even more wealth at the expense of the very people they swear to serve and protect."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"UK viewer here and it baffles me Trump has won but thats democracy. Have seen that clip of Rogan so much recently and the fact he knew having Trump on would basically hand a massive hand up to Trump...did it win him the election? Hard to say but it definitely puts independent media in a spot now where theyre in some cases the new main stream media now. What changed in what Trump was or stood for since what Joe said? Nothing...if anything he is worse now after being convicted multiple times etc and whose campaign has been focussed on trans and abortion rights. Culture war issues over actual policy that affects all. I didnt think much of Kamala but at least her campaign talked about policies. Tim Walz seemed like a decent guy too when you sae him reasoning with former Trump voters. Its strange when you saw abortion as such a big issue and voter turnout said it was 55-45 women-men so you would have thought that meant more votes for Kamala, but no. Its gonna be really interesting seeing all the analysis of where the democrats fumbled this and what about a (imo failed) former President getting re-elected on the same type of divisive rhetoric means when you look at USA from outside and what the majority of those people stand for."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Woke losers
XgBVMwNHRgY,This one aint it
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Rogan just has conversations with people, and he did a 3hr interview with Trump. Kamala was given the same opportunity and her campaign wanted to do the interview at another location, under their own terms with their own controls."
XgBVMwNHRgY,being a Rogan  and Trump hater is unacceptable
XgBVMwNHRgY,This guys butthurt
XgBVMwNHRgY,MAGA WOMP WOMP 🎉🎉
XgBVMwNHRgY,MAGA WOMP WOMP 🎉🎉🎉
XgBVMwNHRgY,💯
XgBVMwNHRgY,Yeah aba definitely a diddy party type of dude 😂
XgBVMwNHRgY,"People like podcast format because it is UNFILTERED, we are smart enough to hear candidates opinions and judge for ourselves instead of MSM telling us what happened and what ""they meant"""
XgBVMwNHRgY,You guys are taking an L on this one fr
XgBVMwNHRgY,Nobody cares for your leftist views anymore we know you guys are full of shit just like the ppl you talk and post about
XgBVMwNHRgY,"They have been for a while now. However, the far right pipeline full of grifters is extremely dangerous. 

Avoid the manosphere, red pill, or any of the BS podcasts that host highly controversial figures. They’re all aiming to influence predominantly boys and young men."
XgBVMwNHRgY,you two need to stop worrying about american politics and come get your boy Destiny...he out here crashing out and making a fool of himself.
XgBVMwNHRgY,I think they all both play a key role in the election cycle and both should be there for people to tune into for their decision. You have the hard hitting questions by journalists/opposing channels and debates and then long form podcasts to more humanize and get to know the person you’re voting for.
XgBVMwNHRgY,Money.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Yeah, you can be mad that politicians are going on popular podcasts if you want, but that's a result of what the people want. People that have started finding original videos and sources for themselves and comparing to what the media reports are no longer under any illusion that we are given the truth by ""mainstream"" news sources and people would rather listen to real time conversations than news interviews. Joe Rogan didn't want Trump on in the 2020 election, but obviously things have changed since then, and Kamala was offered to go on Joe Rogan as well, and she declined. Let's just ignore that though and complain that podcasters and comedians are tools when they have hours long conversations  with people we don't like while avoiding pointing out all of the bull**** celebrity endorsements and known editing with news sources going on with Kamala's side (because those celebrities are signed with other companies and labels!) lol. Let's also ignore all Trump supporters being called garbage by our ""current president."" Someone becoming too popular as an independent podcaster doesn't remove their right to free speech or tohave on the guests they choose. Even if it gets your knickers in a knot lol"
XgBVMwNHRgY,I love you guys but this a wild take
XgBVMwNHRgY,I don't know guys. Long time follower and I've see a tightening and discontent over a while.
XgBVMwNHRgY,I was thinking this exact thing today!!
XgBVMwNHRgY,"We have to go to independent media for the truth and at the very least, more perspective. The alternative is censored and biased."
XgBVMwNHRgY,I agree but they should challenge politicians podcast is a long session with them so it gets to all parts of what they want to change not just sound bits trigonometry do amazing job on their podcast
XgBVMwNHRgY,😂black liberal canadians😂😂😂😂😂 homosexuals😂😂😂
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Independence was an illusion. Yeah we got the internet and some people got on and made edgy jokes for a few years. And then people started using it as a means of money, power and popularity like we do with everything. It's how the story goes."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"yes and no. Like Joe Rogan and Call Her Daddy never claimed to be investigative journalist or interviewers. Joe constantly talks about how he wants people on just to have a genuine conversation as a human being. And if I invite you to have a conversation with me, I'm going to respect your boundaries whether it's cuz of personal/emotional reasons, PR reasons, whatever it is.
Also, give me one example of where people get to see politicians or celebrities go to an 'interview' where they KNOW they will be attacked. Nowhere. That's just never gonna happen when you tell a politician/celebrity that we want a debate and will press you for certain topics, they won't go on that show, unless it's mandated debate for election or they need to clear their name.
So you have a choice that person A will come on your show and you can talk about these 5 topics and not talk about these other 5 topics; OR you don't get to have them on the podcast at all. So if you are interested in all 10 topics, at least you get to talk about the 5 topics than nothing at all."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Aba's shirt not having buttons popping out of the 3rd/4th slit reaalllyyy distracted me loll
XgBVMwNHRgY,Y’all should’ve went on a rant at ppl twerkin at a Harris event
XgBVMwNHRgY,You guys are kind of doing the same thing. We can see you guys don’t really like maga. You said Tony said things that were pro Israel when he roasted them and Palestine in the same rock and paper joke
XgBVMwNHRgY,"4:50 everyone likes acting dumb Podcasters acting like they have no influence be for real,people who consume your content on a day to day will take what you say seriously,the news outlets really lost their hold things with regards to politics."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Well Kamala could have also come and done 3 hours in Rogan if she had wanted to so what is the issue?  they both get the chance, if they take it or not that is on them."
XgBVMwNHRgY,The fact that people are really convinced these candidates are going on podcasts for funzies is insane. Like? Are yall serious?
XgBVMwNHRgY,There was no such thing as independent media it was always been internet media
XgBVMwNHRgY,Bruh.... they constantly hold Trumps feet to the fire.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"😂😂
Joe Rogan denied Trump for years. When he finally agree to it, yall try to profit off of a lame ass video."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Yes
XgBVMwNHRgY,Roland Martin is different but all the rest ehhh
XgBVMwNHRgY,"""Blah blah blah I believe blah blah are political tools blah blah blah"" OMG Y'ALL SOUND LIKE MISERABLE BORING MALE KARENS 😩"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Both sides were invited on Rogan not just trump stupid ass Kamala said no, can’t blame Rogan for that chill buddy"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"It’s okay. The fate of the USA is at stake, so let them be biased during the elections."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I kinda wish you'd pick a lane and stay in it, either don't talk about American politics, or choose to talk about it and do it fairly. Theres so much more important stuff to addess with American politics than the candidates appearing on podcasts."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"The fact that people are emotionally charged says everything....what is the point?  Is it mind control?   

So when can we teach the masses about self-awareness, decernment, emotional regulation, vs. emotional reaction.  The list goes on... it's not like people the www at their finger tips.  

People need to be spoon-fed to realize they are being used by tools instead of using the tool like a double-edged sword that it is."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"But Aba and Preach, YOU BOTH ARE COMEDIANS who are now COMMENTING ON POLITICS 😂"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Id argue this is what is has always been.... comics have been political propaganda for centuries since Europe started printing pamphlets and caricatures, and podcasts are (imo) just a weird form of radio. You see some unwashed dudes talking instead of not seeing anything, but it follows the same principle, and it works wonders for negative topics."
XgBVMwNHRgY,So many of these butt hurt Republicans
XgBVMwNHRgY,Let's see if you drop a video telling people to vote in the next 24 hrs
XgBVMwNHRgY,"You two have the most introspective conversations. You speak with wisdom, and that's why you will be around for as long as you want to be."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Crazy TDS from ppl whose opinions on our politics don't matter at all 🤷🏽‍♂️ and damn near everyone that had trump on also reached out to Kamala. It's not their fault she didn't go on those pods. Get off that man nuts already and stay to the norm quit tryna dwell into our politics when you're not even from here 🤦🏽‍♂️
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Yall lowkey missed with this one. 

Independent Journalism has been thriving because Mainstream Media is so controlled my handlers! You can’t get honesty out of mainstream media. 

Also Joe is very unbiased with this interview with trump! He has tried to have Kamala on the podcast as well, but Kamala’s camp had weird demands."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I don't like the way this conversation is constantly used to spread falsehoods. I saw the Kamala Fox interview, obviously people unlike these idiots, who are Canadian and thus not voting in this election. The one thing I agree with is people should stop getting their news from idiots on the internet. That includes the two posting on this channel."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Context regarding Tony's joke at the rally: he is a major supporter for environmental issues, and has spoken on how Puerto Rico has had major issues regarding pollution (especially regarding the ocean). Whic, ironically, was also elaborated on during Rogan's episode after Trump...."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I can't speak on the other casters, but gotta disagree in regards to Rogen. He interviews whoever he wants, did challenge Trump off and on, and gave further criticisms in the following episode. Regarding his previous opinion of having Trump on, a person can change their mind. (Maybe that interview with Lex helped change his mind.) Rogan's already had other politicians on this very year. He'd also tried to reach Harris, but it didn't work out. (Too bad, because that would've also been good to see.)

I like Abba and Preach. At the same time this was a bit of a stretch."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Still feel like there’s a difference between independent media and televised/broadcasted media. Although these streamers, podcasters, and content creators make money off of politics, they don’t make their money directly from politicians, political organizations, or the government which inherently would motivate them politically. 

If these people want to jump ship, they have the freedom to tell the truth and say what’s really on their mind. They don’t have to worry about being cut off the air or fired. They have control over their own narrative which is not true for most anchors and journalists who work for large corporatized media companies. Ultimately they do get their paycheck from somewhere, and that’s the audience, but now these influencers can weigh what that income and perception is worth to them, and if they speak up, we can tell they’re being genuine. 

I just think a lot of them aren’t real politically geared, and that’s an issue when they’re doing random interviews with candidates. Joe specifically asked Kamala to go on, but she or her team said no, so I can’t blame Joe. Also Joe treated Trump like any other guest, so I don’t think he really switched up to gain his favor"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"This was one of your best commentaries of all! Well done, you are spot on!"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"If you want those 3 hours, then you get the interview. It's not Rogans job to get your the interview you want. 

and Imagine thinking legacy media journalists are holding politicians to a fire"
XgBVMwNHRgY,This video is to pot calling the kettle black
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I think you are missing something , it’s not how soft or hard the questions are. There is a reason Kamela will do a hostile interview with Fox News but won’t do a 3 hour interview with Rogan. The challenge is not that Rogan is going to ask hard questions, it’s that you can’t hide who you are in a 3 hour long conversation, whereas in a hostile interview it’s acceptable to retreat into your script"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"i think your take is wrong. are they being a little ""soft"" just like MSM might ? maybe. but i think what you are missing, is in traditional media, the ""reporter"" or host ""interviews"", and you get prepared answers that fit the interview length and style. with this new media, you gotta be a kind of person who can tow your line for _hours_ ... and if you are a complete tool or a total dipshit, it's gonna be real hard to hide that, so, i think we have gotten a much deeper understanding of the good and bad of the people who have participated in these long forms, and we've _also_ learned something about the people that won't sit down and do a long form."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I remember when they didn't complain and hate on American politics and the people, they no nothing about make-over generalizations. Canada is extremely corrupt their priminister negatively impacting the citizens. If your going to be political talk about how horrible canada is before you start throwing stones."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Tony was being Tony he is not the type of comedian that should be at a political rally his style or genre of comedy is definitely not for a political campaign. But that goes more on the people that booked him he was a horrible choice for that. Now he is the perfect comedian for a roast. But I bet they paid him a bag for that.
XgBVMwNHRgY,Kamala did 60 minutes.  Trump refused.  Kamala has been doing both mainstream and independent media lately.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Love this, your totally right, I hope rogan sees this xxx"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Nah, these interviews are great. There's probably a few topics that can't be discussed but other then that it's raw. Much better than the ones from the media where they already know all the questions that will be asked."
XgBVMwNHRgY,I mean…. When the media refuses to report unbiasedly…. What can we expect?
XgBVMwNHRgY,"But having Taylor, Swift, Beyoncé and M&M is any better? not sure if you’ve done a video about that or not but it is weird times we’re living in"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"People are tired of the mainstream media, it’s mostly fake written dialogue. People want to see real world conversations, just like we today love channels like this one. They’re real."
XgBVMwNHRgY,We need a talking stick for this episode LOL I have so much to say
XgBVMwNHRgY,"I mean, when you look at things like the debates where there is a clear bias against one candidate, why should we be tied to legacy media? They were committing journalistic malpractice out in the open. Im not convinced that seeing our politicians on podcasts is even remotely a problem so long as both do it... and both have. I think the one with more bias against him is doing better right now which is why we are speaking in this way. Joe Biden went on podcasts in 2020 and no one complained... not until this cycle at least"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Some Independent media I would say doesn’t feel as scripted and stale as media on your basic cable channels I think that’s the best difference I think Joe Rogan gives whoever the benefit of the doubt he does just want conversations the people Kamala has done interviews with are people that I would say can be combative more when someone disagrees with them compared to those that do agree with em 
Yes it’s a popularity vote but the main problem people want addressed is the economy problem and trump already gave his answer when Kamala keeps avoiding the question he wants to lower tax rates by using tariffs on foreign nations in trade with America"
XgBVMwNHRgY,The men’s issues problem is still not talked about it’s attempted but nothing every gets better it gets shit down and belittled whenever men’s issues comes up
XgBVMwNHRgY,At the end it looked like Tony was running out of material and just wanted to pull the rip cord
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Rogan invited both trump came on 
And because he went on Kamala also wanted to but problem is she asked him to come to her if
We’re taking Score that 1 for trump o for Kamala on character"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Kyle Kulinski talks about this ""independent"" media is mainstream now. These are multi million dollar studios. Not some guys in their apartment with an iphone"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"The more celebrities i see endorsing the left, the more i see the diddler list"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Very important video, respect to A&P on this one👍🏼"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"This might be the first L from you guys. HOWEVER, nobody is perfect. I’m still subscribed and still enjoy a majority of your content. It’s ok to agree to disagree. You share your opinions about certain topics and it’s not wrong to do so. I agree with at least 90-95% of your shared thoughts. Keep up the good work. Long time fan here."
XgBVMwNHRgY,You're both tripping. Don't you live in Canada anyway?
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Although you are right, the type of interview you are asking for tells you more about the interviewer than the interviewee. ""Why did you vote like this here and there!"" Relax Truman Capote, relax."
XgBVMwNHRgY,You cooked with Arguably the worst rapid given the nerfs and lowest health gg!
XgBVMwNHRgY,These comments are really showing their anti democrat bias
XgBVMwNHRgY,Yo I just wanna know where Aba gets his shirts from
XgBVMwNHRgY,Views on podcasts now are much higher than media outlets. Its only natural
XgBVMwNHRgY,I think podcasters allow the politians to be exposed to a new audience that wouldn't actively watch them on news channels/interviews
XgBVMwNHRgY,guys there was no independence from the start. your on YouTube and you cant even talk about certain things because all powerful YouTube says you cant. your channel like every other youtuber is literally a beholden to kowtow to the YouTube algorithm. now I respect your take on calling out the label of independent media but just understand if something is in the main stream it answers to power no exceptions. its a bit corny to say but that batman quote of you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. well its just independent media's turn
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Man you guys are such hypocritical lost individuals, you guys are describing yourself without even realising it. 😅 🤦🏾"
XgBVMwNHRgY,Rogan became a tool long ago. Now is just more obvious :)
XgBVMwNHRgY,https://youtube.com/shorts/KnBAaYmWoQ0?si=c62pcb_H-O-sfUCJ
XgBVMwNHRgY,Theres the Aba L take of the month. I was worried you didnt have one in October but here you are keeping the streak alive!
XgBVMwNHRgY,Same difference
XgBVMwNHRgY,Nothing is off limits for politics these days.
XgBVMwNHRgY,15:00 its cable all over again
XgBVMwNHRgY,"If the questions are so soft, why isn't Kamala going on Rogan ? .. Can't demonize the format when it revealed the control the democrat party wants to have on interviews."
XgBVMwNHRgY,"The cruse of the avant guarde.

Much love and bless
Mrs Mango of Port Douglas Tropi-cool North Queensland Australia"
XgBVMwNHRgY,So i agree with some of the points for sure but tbf to joe 1 he did also want kamala on so it wasnt just 1 way. Also he did ask questions media would never ask like about aliens and the jfk/mlk files. Yes there weren't a ton of policy based questions but i dont think thts wht he wanted to focus on because you get that stuff with every other interview
XgBVMwNHRgY,Propaganda at its full potential 😂😂😂
XgBVMwNHRgY,I’m so glad these fools are Canadian lol
XgBVMwNHRgY,Any1 with a voice and a platform is a tool
XgBVMwNHRgY,Yes
XgBVMwNHRgY,"14:20 😂man out here like ""same same but different but same.""😅"
XgBVMwNHRgY,Haaaaaaaaaaa how that aged well... and Rogan got paid well also..
XgBVMwNHRgY,5:54 the point is is he's also willing to have Kamala on and talk the same way. The high on likelihood is that she accepts it and does it and is able to do that.
XgBVMwNHRgY,so trump was on joe rogan and you complain yet kamala had 100 puff pieces and also every single celebrity endorcing her because shes paying them
XgBVMwNHRgY,mainstream media is based on corporate intrest so they would litterally say anything
XgBVMwNHRgY,I usually really like your takes Aba but after watching this interview https://youtu.be/sHcFpdKK5RY?si=T12OV_M3rvU2DOya with JD Vance and Rogan I’d have to say you missed the side of the coin that does have politicians on who actually have relevant conversations with creators
XgBVMwNHRgY,podcasters can pick who ever they want to do a podcast with they dont need to have biden or trump or kamala.
XgBVMwNHRgY,I agree with the majority in the this one. Very rare do I purely disagree with yall but yeah. All love tho
XgBVMwNHRgY,Aba got that shirt straight from the 90’s…I know because I had it back then.
XgBVMwNHRgY,"All the people mad in these comments don’t realize they are not from America , y’all don’t realize how many countries think we’re stupid , our way of propaganda, politics etc , America definitely needs to self reflect it’s beyond cringe"
XgBVMwNHRgY,Yes but all media is
XgBVMwNHRgY,"To answer your video title, kinda yes"
XgBVMwNHRgY,"Abba, call Schulz... this is unnecessary. Plus both Schulz and Rogan definately said on multiple episodes in the last year that he would have both sides on to talk and let the audience get to glimps a 3 hour uncut version of these politicians. On both sides... so yea these politicians, if they are smart will do them as they can reach a greater audience and get their message out. Don't forget, these podcasters are after posting great episodes but at least stay true to their core audience. Flagrant humanizes everyone as everyone does/says some wild sh*t  once in a while. Rogan introduces his audience to all sides of an argument/debate.

Don't conflate the politicians objectives with those of the podcasters.
It would have been better if Kamala also had went on so that there could be no possibility of being called biassed"
XgBVMwNHRgY,Times have changed and you gotta understand that there’s great significance in the passage of time.
XgBVMwNHRgY,So the left can have 90% of Hollywood/Athletes/Academia campaign for them for 10+ years but a comedian screams MAGA and now we have a problem… smh
XgBVMwNHRgY,"To be fair Rogan gave kamala to come on, but she things she above everyone."
XgBVMwNHRgY,Y’all are missing the point.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Aight, this one turned out a lot longer than I thought. Hope you enjoy. And yes the anger at the end is very much real."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"What self righteous douchebag names himself preach? 

You know he practices monologues in the mirror and envisions a posse agreeing with him and going ""preach!"""
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Reminder that in a video where a comedian got punched by someone's dad for making a joke about their son they said freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. 

Sure I don't like what the comedian said either but if we're going that route, these two are self described comedians, are they advocating for consequences being brought upon them?"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""Not my Country, not my problem"" is a very stupid standpoint when it comes to the states because they are too influential on geopolitics to not care about what happens there."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"This still irritates the crap out of me. Talk about the most false of false equivalencies. The whole machine is left leaning and has been for quite a long time so at what point have conservatives ever ""set the standard"" as Destiny said. From my observations the left has always set the standard and the right continues to acquiesce like clockwork. These rubes claim Muh both sides spread the violent rhetoric while the whole media apparatus, including entertainment, has been pumping out violent leftist talking points, misinformation and outright lies for the last 10 years. What did the right have at their disposal to spread any rhetoric during the same time period? Fox news. The scales have been tipped by the oligarchs who own these corporations and fund the campaigns of the left. Who has been systematically suppressed across all social media during those 10 years? The right. The evidence is so overwhelming that it cannot be disputed yet they still do. It is really as simple as this, if Joe Biden was in Trumps shoes that day and Destiny was a conservative who gleefully celebrated the end of someone in the crowd the whole machine would have come down on him and he would've been crucified, deplatfromed and depersoned. A simple role reversal would demonstrate the fallacy of their argument. They are completely disingenuous so I understand the anger at the end there."
-kgYKaEokJ8,Destiny is the internet's biggest cuck. No wonder his wife left him for mclovin lite and even paid her new man's rent lol.
-kgYKaEokJ8,How would they even know what Freedom of Speech is considering how they don't have it in Canada 😂
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""Dont ever think that im going to be afraid to say what im gonna say."" 

Yeah, this is the video that they lost me. The false equivalences truly pissed me the fuck off."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"something that really irks me... people act like Jan 6 was some wild event with actual death tolls. I'm talking plural of deaths... officers lives threatened in the line of duty... I remember a couple heart attacks in the area surrounding the main highlighted locations, one woman shot... and some cops dying at a later date either due to suicide or strokes.

I don't think there were even 20 actual casualties unless we get very generous with how we define the term and include such BS as stubbing toes and bruised egos"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Well gotta give destiny and his ex wife credit they obviously screwed aba's brains out, as there's none left."
-kgYKaEokJ8,The enemy of modern day Leftism is objective reality.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"The fact that someone who presents himself as a left wing intellectual like Destiny can make the claim that Trump tried to overthrow the government... just blows my mind. If he isn't being disingenuous and actually believes such nonsense.. holy shit. No insurrection in the world has ever been conducted in such a manner. And why is this somehow different from the antifa people who decided to take over a block in Portland? Or the protestors who were proudly talking about how they were besieging the white house and trump was hiding in the white house? Or the people who pushed into the house of representatives and started shouting and making noise about abortion? They did exactly the same thing, just fewer people and they were allowed in. Yet none of those are insurrections, yet Trump is an insurrectionist? Because why, he claimed the voting was rigged? Haven't democrats been making that same claim the entirety of Trump's presidency, claiming that Russian interference was why he became president, and that he was illegitimate?"
-kgYKaEokJ8,The idiocy is strong with them!
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Yet the left is doing that far more!
The litter tray these muppets have been playing in and now whine once they’re on the receiving end for a change!"
-kgYKaEokJ8,Yet he IS gleeful the gutless hypocrite!
-kgYKaEokJ8,This spoon was more cheritable to these two sub-saharans than I would have been.  😂
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Trump. ""March peacefully. Let your voices be heard."" 

Leftists ""ThAtS a DoG wHiStLe To tHe AlT rIgHT!"""
-kgYKaEokJ8,"There are objective standards as to what's considered socially acceptable vs. unacceptable speech, and thus an objective standard for when complaining about that speech is warranted.

Saying Trump is a Fascist because he insults the MSM is not warranted, because the MSM are dishonest warmongering authoritarians who deserve all the verbal flak they get. Calling Destiny a hate-filled loser for his blanket hatred of anybody who identifies with the political alignment known as 'Republican' is warranted because only a hate-filled loser would speak that way. It's not a moral or legal issue, it's a cultural one."
-kgYKaEokJ8,Imagine not re-recording a video that is out of focus 💀
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Everything you said about America’s being morons is true. But the last time I check, the UK is ruled by an inbred family don’t go throwing stones when you live in a glass house."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""Far right.""

Doesn't Canada kill their disabled and defund working class people?

Does Canada have free speech?"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"They were decent at one time but they have gotten out of touch with regular people.  Preach thinking a woman was lying about a family of three surviving on 40k a year.  They went from street views to high street listening to white wine mom views, but that is the current Canadian way."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Let's be clear Spoon, they are French Canadians/Quebecers"
-kgYKaEokJ8,This man thinks the 5% at best is the 95% 3:48.
-kgYKaEokJ8,2:50 Said the one with an aristocracy.
-kgYKaEokJ8,And just imagine... another weirdo tried to assassinate trump 2 months after the first one cause they just can't stop the destructive rhetoric
-kgYKaEokJ8,Centrists are so boring. If your opinion is that you don't care. Don't get involved
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Also isn't the point of these rallies is to hear what canidate says unfiltered by media or spin to make up you own mind?
Look how many lefties went to Trump rallies and was shell shocked."
-kgYKaEokJ8,Canadians telling Americans what freedom of speech is..  Wow. Just Stop.  I realized these guys are Grifters in the true form.  They don't care about America but all the content is about American politics and culture?  Dang Another video The Aristocratic Utensil moved the needle...   Stop spying on me!!!
-kgYKaEokJ8,"So you did point out something.  Aba and Preach.. don't care about America/are not American but all their content is about America.
Makes you go hmmm.  All their content is based on American culture..."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"As an Aba and Preach fan, their video was a miss for me....not usual for aba n preach (maybe im just blind to it because i enjoy their videos so much) but i could tell this was charged in a specific direction.

Also! Hello! Subscribed recently, love the videos and perspective."
-kgYKaEokJ8,Just saw jlongbones video on this and punching the protester in the face was in reference to a guy who went the that rally and started attacking people there and who was then escorted of the rally by security
-kgYKaEokJ8,"One more point on the Pelosi bullshit. The Video ""proof"" did not show Pelosi actually getting hit with the hammer or anything else for that matter. However, the news showed it with the preamble, ""what were about to show you is extremely graphic."" It wasn't. That whole thing was a shitshow and many here made fun of it simply for that reason."
-kgYKaEokJ8,I'm ashamed to say I used to watch these guys.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Yes, NOTHING sums up this video. As someone who isn't American, the idiot is the one who thinks there isn't something like LEFT or RIGHT. Guess that's why this channel has 40k subs. Did your family get tired of your political rants at home, told your 22 year old ass to start your own YT channel so they don't need to listen to you yapping all day long. I don't even know this Aba preach guys but ill rather listen to what they have to say than someone from the far right. whamp whamp."
-kgYKaEokJ8,I'm new here. Definately subbing.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"BLM wasnt over George Floyd, it was over black folks suffering from police brutality at a disproportionate rate compared to others. Thats really disingenuous for somone who calls people hacks. 😂😂😂"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Aristocrat you are so disingenuous. The rioters had already broke in before they were let in.

You speak on reality when trump folks made videos of themselves breaking in, smh. Youre lying piece crab, bro.

As far as the guy killed, no right wing person was crying over Heather from the Charlottesville riot in VA. Right wingers will support violence against the left, but cry when it comes their way.

Come out of your echo chamber."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""Everything hinges on Jan 6 being an insurrection, which is bollocks""
see there's your problem. You don't know anything about the event."
-kgYKaEokJ8,I don’t know what footage you saw people were not just “let in” by law enforcement and wandering around like it was some guided tour. That is a load of sh__.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I find it funny how when it comes to defending destiny, aba wants to be ""accurate"" as to not misquote him, but when it comes to trump he missquotes/misrepresents his words or actions just to make a point about how much he doesn't care about American politics, righht aba, SUUUREEE!! 😂 ...You're totally not just saying that to avoid criticising you best fwend"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I stopped watching Aba and Preach a long time ago. After hearing Aba state that they dont actually care about anything they talk about and mention casually that him and Preach aren't even friends irl I quickly came to realize that they were just grifting hacks that stand on nothing and thus dont deserve their audience or my time, they can get fucked and go back to working at Tim Hortons or wherever."
-kgYKaEokJ8,The two of them always love taking pot shots at F&F and they’re becoming less interesting commentators . I can’t take them serious anymore because of the Destiny debacle .
-kgYKaEokJ8,Another whiney person whining about shit 😅
-kgYKaEokJ8,They seem to have some off the wall takes a lot of the times
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Not to justify the ones saying it on the right, but there's a huge difference between wanting to punch an annoying ass protestor or a domestic terrorist (antifa) in the face...... and a full court press of the mainstream media and the establishment left for YEARS now calling all conservatives or moderates nazis and racists and all the ""phobes"" and white supremacists (even the conservative/moderate non-white americans) and anti immigration and immigrants and conspiracy theorists etc etc.... who all follow the modern Adolf in trump. I mean, we've seen several cases of attacks and riots and even murder of trump supporters (streets of Portland, for example).  If you actually thought these accusations were true and trump was the next hitler and half the country are nazis and will destroy the country if they take power..... who WOULDNT violently oppose that? I know I would if a legit tyrant was trying to take power. It's why we have the 2nd amendment ffs, lol. But these are all false allegations, all born out of the desire to keep or gain power by the establishment left. It's completely obvious at this point"
-kgYKaEokJ8,he has no moral standard when his moral standard sleeps with 9 yo girls
-kgYKaEokJ8,Aba & preach the way i is see them are leftists who pretend to have almost centrist takes but like being fence sitters.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"As a big fan of Aba & Preach since 2016. I’ll say this it’s one of the few times they’ve said some real dumb shit. And there were a few more. From what I’ve come to see politics is not their strong suit in any way shape or form, even if they fence sit they still unironically defended a member who coincides with Far Left talking and thinking points. And I understand that Aba and Destiny are friends, but even then any normal person would look at their friend and say “ ay dude chill out what the hell is wrong with you “ but instead Aba just played dumb to it. Now do I still watch em? Ye I do only because they talk about other stuff like societal and cultural discourse on dating, calling out degenerates, stuff like that… but I won’t lie I’ve definitely lost some shed of respect for em after seeing them delete comments calling them out for being wrong on this one."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"These mfs better put some respec on our name. Only reason anyone knows who they are is Bcz of their commentary on things going on AMERICA. Notice how they never talk about the sht show of a country they live in. Hell after that, I doubt they even see Trudeau as a problem."
-kgYKaEokJ8,The mob put him in power
-kgYKaEokJ8,I dont care because trump is owned by mafia
-kgYKaEokJ8,This kid is a muppet. Wants attention by talking about abba and preach
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Wondering around the place aimlessly? And the people pushing themselves inside? The windows broken? And the people trampled and the woman that died?
You dont know anything"
-kgYKaEokJ8,Aba & Preach are pushed in the algorithm because they don't push boundaries. Boring
-kgYKaEokJ8,Thank you! Finally someone called them out for how stupid they are. They are the first guys to call out people like fresh and fit and not call out destiny when there’s literally endless things to objectively critique from destiny
-kgYKaEokJ8,The problem here is that Abba is close friends with destiny so he for some reason can't be unbiased
-kgYKaEokJ8,Well at least preach tried to approach it in from the middle grown but still failed
-kgYKaEokJ8,Im glad someone made a vid on this. Aba and Preach are turning into clowns. They usually have reasonable takes but my god this one was bad.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I've never seen so much speaking with nothing being said, and I work in marketing."
-kgYKaEokJ8,Take away the politics and i bet theyll have much to say. Abba switched the subject real quick
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I'm an Aba & Preach viewer. I usually indulge in their videos, and actually hoped they had a good opinion of what happened. The only thing I can commend Aba on is his loyalty toward a friend. But this was their own bad take, literal ""Fresh & Fit moment"". This was not a good look for them. This will not age well. They DID NOT handle this well. This will come back to bite them many times, and yet they are willing to lose their subscriber count and fans they gained over the years for this. This double-down from them, is extremely disappointing. & they deserve what they get from this. eh, THIS is what they asked for & what they wanted. Sad."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I used to be a destiny fan, but now his content is just pure unhinged TDS trash"
-kgYKaEokJ8,Subbed once i heard your opinion on the 6th 👍🏾
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Imagine calling yourself a Centrist when you defend the actions of a man who got called out by a fellow Commie! 

Dude, if a Communist thinks what you said was f*cked up then what does that make someone who DOESNT call it out? 😂"
-kgYKaEokJ8,People just now realizing that Aba and Preach are not very intelligent is hilarious to me. I never listen to these two because I think they’re intelligent. I listen to them because they're entertaining.
-kgYKaEokJ8,Ehhh this is the slick racist type Channel. Aba and preach  aren’t Canadian cuz their parents are originally from another country despite them having citizenship. So I guess only white French ppl can be Canadian…this that type of channel. Unsubbed
-kgYKaEokJ8,Now Trump is not a good person or an intelligent president by any means but an assassination is still not okay. He isnt Fidel Castro or Osama Bin Laden
-kgYKaEokJ8,I dropped those guys a while now. They're hypocrites. I watched them a lot in the earlies. They started to get icky when they talked about the riots. Then the Fresh and Fit thing happened. They obsessively made videos on that and then they started to hangout with Destiny. Their takes got more ridiculous over time.
-kgYKaEokJ8,Aaaaand free speach..... destiny can say what he wants .
-kgYKaEokJ8,I've been saying this preach needs to leave Abba. He is a trash individual
-kgYKaEokJ8,"All the comments disagree with you

You dumb bruh"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"You really think the pro trump pro gun group would be unarmed????

Yikes

Are you even an American citizen?? Have you been to Texas??"
-kgYKaEokJ8,Dumb
-kgYKaEokJ8,Philip Defranco looked like he has jumped on the vegan train.
-kgYKaEokJ8,Them dudes are suspect
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Aba and preach are pure booty boys.
Im canadian, and i cannot stand those two fruits. 
Talk about having the dumbest take on the most vile take... destiny and the two queens deserve each other.."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""Not my country not my problem."" Well it is your problem cause the US is what allows freedom to exist in the modern world or do we forget that when people fight for freedom the hold up the American flag"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Hell no
We don't celebrate attempted assassinations in 3rs world countries
Hell even when the American media was saying loud pop and shit, our country was calling it an assassination attempt like an actual bews channel"
-kgYKaEokJ8,They won’t have an ig live regarding cus they know they’ll get cooked. Thanks for providing an alternate perspective on this
-kgYKaEokJ8,"If anyone was looking for A&P bashing cesspool of garbage, you got it. Anyone with their brains still intact just move on"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Im a Canadian and in sick and tired of Canadians being flippant about America,  If we didn't boarder the USA Canada doesn't exist, get off your high horse and show some gratitude"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I can't believe Aba and Preach have spoken like true A-holes, meanwhile their Prime Minister happily invited a literal Nazi from the Ukraine and applauded."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""Dweeby liberals"" 
Shows picture of Hassan 😂"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"fun fact: If we were able to go through the footage of the antifa riots showing the chants, signs, and wanton destruction those with firing synapses could easily come away with the summation that they clearly were calling for and doing everything in their power to accomplish the violent overthrow of the governing body. 
 I can't call those outraged by jan6 2021, who ignore the more destructive riot on jan6 2017 hypocrites because it is about hierarchy. They genuinely believe they are superior and justified."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I use really like em too, I believed they were apolitical or centrist at least and could see the many faults of the so called progressives of the modern age who would be duking it out with progressives of the past. 

and now this

Man things are escalating fast X_X"
-kgYKaEokJ8,The ending was hilarious. Sums people up pretty much 😂
-kgYKaEokJ8,"So, it was the right wing who burned down st Johns church, yeah? Conservatives created this culture of violence, spare me."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Yeah they goofed on this one. Aba rides Destiny's shitty take where he basically says ""well they started it"". If we believe you then we simply have 2 people being wrong. Doesn't justify your shitty behavior"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I don't know how originally called progs *""snowflakes,""* but I'm getting the impression calling them that wounded them *so much* they never really recovered. They're still whining about it to this very day as the ""very bad thing the right did."" It seems to leave a scar so deep, so painful, so damaging to their psyche, a scar that never healed. Probably because it describes them accurately."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"From the way they speak they don't seem like the brightest bulbs in the store...
P.S. And there they go. A long video of trying to appeal to a superior morality, just to end up exactly where all of this discussion usually goes to crap. I was right all along."
-kgYKaEokJ8,Crazy to be an American and seeing people who don’t even live in my country so emotionally invested in my politics.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"January 6th and the events leading up to it was an insurrection. Donald Trump tried to coup the government by using fake electors, and when that didn't work, he sent a crowd of people to the White House to riot. All of this together is an insurrection, but if you think that word is too scary to use, he at least tried to coup the government, and that isn't disputable."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Oh yea, these guys tend to occasionally make you forget that they're moral cowards"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Why does this feel like like 2009 - 2012 YT, when the platform was dominated by Athiests, Canadians,  and people from the UK 🤔?"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"As much as I enjoy your content, PLEASE stop making fun of my country. I know we have many idiots who inhabit our land *cough* Dev *cough* but we were created from a fusion of the French colonists and British/American Loyalists. 

We fought proudly for this nation, even being the only ones aside from the British who took a stab at DC in revenge for York (Toronto) being burnt.

Edit: I now just realized these two Muppets are from Canada as well...
My fatherland is dying."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"50% of American's believe the other 50% of American should be disarmed. That same 50% of American's who believe that also believe that the other 50% of Americans were attempting a insurrection without being armed.

J6 was 2 things if we want to be blunt and honest: Unlawful Assembly that led to Rioting. Believe me that was an Attack, a lot of congress folks would have gotten deleted."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Definitely seemed like a cop out from Abba and Preach to maintain their friendship. I will still watch them, but im absolutely done with morally bankrupt Destiny."
-kgYKaEokJ8,Thank you spoon i also lost braincells watching that video can't blame you.
-kgYKaEokJ8,Found a really bad take on Trumps recent interview. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0tHKDL5LGg
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Destiny: “i’m not wanting anyone to get shot.”
Also destiny: “i wish he had better aim”"
-kgYKaEokJ8,Why do so many europeans have strong opinions on american politics💀
-kgYKaEokJ8,"So Aba said he *watched* Trump say ""the only good liberal is a dead democrat"", but it turns out that that was just Trump tweeting in reference to a video with that title? 😂"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"These idiots are literally comparing ""bad speech"" to a literal assassination attempt. This is what happens when you became so brain rotted with woke nonsense."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Wow, thorough video, with receipts 🧾. I subscribed!"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"9:18 That's a centrist for you. Stands for nothing, but speaks on everything"
-kgYKaEokJ8,Was it Aba or Preach who rizzed up Destiny's wife on camera?
-kgYKaEokJ8,Summer of love was mostly peaceful even tho they force trump to the bunker but Jan 6th grandmas were for sure starting an insurrection with the horn guy. The stupidity on the left is just incredible the most armed far right population came to defeat democracy with no guns 😂😂.
-kgYKaEokJ8,You people are snowflakes
-kgYKaEokJ8,"It's weird that these guys did not come out of the closet sooner. It's 2024, did they not know that it is celebrated with parades, floats and story hours? Silly, timid creatures!"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"To your question at 3:00... there is actually a process where the congress can call a hold on ballots they believe to be incorrect, and it was actually applied against him in 2016... so the peaceful demonstration could have worked to reinforce the guts of GOP congresscritters, allowing them to throw out 3 states."
-kgYKaEokJ8,I think REGARDLESS of your political leaning assassination of a political figure is WRONG. The mockery of the death of an individual protecting his family is WRONG (hell this dude was a fkn firefighter)
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Yeah I had to unsub from them, which is a shame. Preach looked like he didn’t want to be in the video and Aba failed to hold his friend accountable. Right or wrong, a good friend would tell his friend when they are out of line , but he just enables him. I noticed that Aba over the years acts like he’s always right 😅"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Silverstein.....




My man is noticing."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"I like Aba and Preach, but i definity disagreed with their take. I don't particularly like Trump (I'm British so it doesn't necessarily matter) but i still feel bad for him and the man who died, R.I.P to him."
-kgYKaEokJ8,3:35 Yet another example of British conservatives irrational vitriol against Americans.
-kgYKaEokJ8,Fresh and Fit were right about these emmasculated clowns
-kgYKaEokJ8,"So much yikes
  They admit they don't even know the most basic details or information then followed it up with 'we're not American so I don't care' which makes the video even more ridiculous and meaningless, and then saying their being accurate is laughable.
 The only way they could of made a more ignorant video...is if Destiny was there talking ironically, the perfect example of uninformed brainrot, the fact their from Canada and Trudeau voters is just the icing on the cake because it explains so much even without knowing all the crap they said to defend the BLM riots"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Anyone notice Aba & preach say “You Guy” “You you you” “All of you”.  Constantly!  Almost every other word.

It’s almost like they now there audience."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Anyone notice Aba & preach say “You Guy” “You you you” “All of you”.  Constantly!  Almost every other word.

-kgYKaEokJ8,Destiny is an authoritarian sociopath.
-kgYKaEokJ8,One person died before the BLM Riots......... afterwards ALMOST 30 people died nationwide. Where's the justice? Make it make since!
-kgYKaEokJ8,"People forget that this is actually like the third time someone tried to Unalive Trump. The first time was a guy who ran up to the podium at him with a knife, the second attempt was a perpetrator who tried to snatch a gun from a security guard during a rally."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"People don't call Trump an insurrectionist because he was going to take over the country, they do so because he used insurrectionist rhetoric to encourage his followers to take violent action. His rhetoric at the end of the last election was CENTERED around how the corrupt liberals have stolen the election and moreover their ""god given"" country. He stoked the fires of that unrest, then encouraged people to march on the capitol as if doing so wasn't going to lead to a violent outcome. You are also glossing over the fact that several people died during January 6th, it's not like it was a school trip, people were trashing and rioting. 

 Aba's point isn't that ""everyone does it therefore it's fine"", it's that ""everyone does it so why should I care if someone else is doing it?"". That is not the same thing. He never actually says if he thinks it's bad or not, in fact he even says he could see how someone could, he only states that he doesn't care because that kind of rhetoric is normal in America. 

That is the biggest cope I've ever heard, Griffin's and Trump's intentions were clear. Unless you believe that they have less than 10 braincells and are too stupid to see it, that rhetoric is clearly inciting violence. Furthermore, the difference is Trump was literally the president, presidents are held to much higher standards than some random streamer. 

 I also find it kind of ironic how Destiny was actually pro Kyle Rittenhouse and conservatives ate it up but now that he's doing pretty much the same thing here conservatives are butt hurt about it."
-kgYKaEokJ8,thos guys are losers man!!! i'm so glad this is happening. i hope they lose all their subs.

-kgYKaEokJ8,These people probably support Justin Trudeau's clown show.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"7:50 ""I'm gonna say what I say whether you leave or not, whether we go down a million subs or not, we don't care.""

These types always say shit like this, then act all shocked when their customer base evaporates.

20:50 For the millionth time, ""freedom of speech"" actually means that the *federal government* can't infringe on your right to say what you want. That's what the Constitution is intended to be. A document explaining what powers are allowed and denied to the federal government."
-kgYKaEokJ8,5:20 1000% on point leftists can be mad all they want but they are violent and show that destruction is all they can do
-kgYKaEokJ8,After the anti whyte pepo jibberish I've heard on their channel I am not suprised at anything they say really. I mean I'm no fan of the Palantir/bagel land affilited Donnie T these days either but I'm a monarchist who does his best to be consistent. I think the whole Left vs Right paradigm needs to be relegated to histories waste bin & thus dislike both parties etc.
-kgYKaEokJ8,aba n preach are nothing more than usefull idiots who go up against the wall too
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Thanks for reminding me that I was still subbed to Aba and Preach, even though I haven’t watched one of their videos in years.  I fixed it.  Cheers, Spoon man!"
-kgYKaEokJ8,Being shot and killed is the same as wanting to punch someone?
-kgYKaEokJ8,I don’t understand why anyone would go to any YouTuber for political takes lol.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"You know it's going to get interest when we start off by saying, ""we need all the whisky."" As far as Destiny saying ""I would make fun of you if you got killed at a trump rally"", didn't Destiny call his mom in the middle of one of his live steams and harass her for voting for Trump?"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"This whole idea of ""escalation"" is silly.  It does nothing to respond to our actual criticism, which is just that there is a line you should never cross.  If some 10-year old sticks out his tongue at me on the subway, and I call him stupid, then he responds by calling me an ugly waste of space, I still can't punch him in the mouth for it.  Even though he started the feud and escalated it, there's still a line there.  I don't know why liberals can never get this concept."

-kgYKaEokJ8,"wait a moment, spoon said ""left and right are bad ideas that shouldn't be used"" then ""the enemy of leftism is reality"" using the left-right thingy in his next sentence. Does it not count when you put the suffix 'ism' on the end?"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""zero Sympathy"" is not the same as ""cheering on the death"" of Corey there is a difference not feeling bad about the situation isnt the same as being happy about a situation its not a binary thing of this is either good or bad, it can be bad when something bad happens to someone who supports a bad person but more often than not you won't care, there's 7 billion people on the planet you cannot feel bad for everyone that has ever died.

The man supported a murderer and a rapist, is it enough to cheer on his death? Not for me but for alot of people out there it's karma, i dont think you were upset when Bin Laden was merked. I dont think you were crying when the hamas leader was killed or anyone supporting isis, hamas or alquida. 

To some trump is more of a terrorist than any of the previous listed groups and why should they feel bad if someone who supports a terrorist dies?

His line was ""I have no sympathy for anyoem who supports this man and dies"" 

If you wanted to give the situation accurate representation you'd probably hold more viewers but unfortunately you have a side on view and instead of moving around to get a head on view youre choosing to take a skewed perspective and run with it and to someone who has followed the situation it shows you are corrupting facts to throw out absolute bullshit."
-kgYKaEokJ8,I am neutral but their takes are just disgusting so i unsubscribe on their channel

-kgYKaEokJ8,I don't know if it's fair to call Aba N Preach's out of touch morons but I'm going to do it anyway.  Mostly because pretty much everything you said about their reaction to the Destiny discourse was %100 right.  Those two need to do more than a little research before the open their mouths next.  Peace bro. I'm out.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"As an American i want to be mad at you, but we all fucking stupid. Quick to rise, quick to fall. Yet, good luck everyone else once America falls."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"6:16 so he also believes the lefts talking points that ""full immunity"" applies to ""insurrection"" ""death squads"" etc ... hes either lying or an idiot who believes everything the propaganda ministers in the mainstream media tell him and does zero research on his own."
-kgYKaEokJ8,3:00 Funny how you say all this without video evidence.

Normies are tired of all the *rap being pushed down our throats. It's all starting to come back up."
-kgYKaEokJ8,5:26 no correlation to the events that happened in the Capitol you cannot compare it it's comparing apples and oranges please do not be fed up by the Kool-Aid of the radical right-wingers and their hypocrisy. An unlawful storming or marching into the capitol would be perceived by any Nation as an attack on the capital no matter how insignificant the aftermath of the situation was with that being said you have to just continue on with your logic and do not go as intense as those crazy lefties. Feorge Gloyd has nothing to do with J-3x2
-kgYKaEokJ8,The left has never recovered from their inability to meme… they just spout words they don’t understand because they’re literal NPCs. Canada is a sad pathetic country.

-kgYKaEokJ8,"This video is challenging to me. At times, I feel dumber as I watch those two defend a psychopath. The rest of the time, I feel like my brain is being resuscitated by a spoon.

And it's crazy people still think Jan 6 was peaceful, I saw the same video of people being let in, you know what I also saw? The countless amount of footage that also showed it was anything but peaceful. Why did they use the windows if they were being let in? Or push past the gates and beat the police with their batons? or tried to break through that locked door inside where that women got shot?"
-kgYKaEokJ8,I'm so happy I unsubbed from them. The moment I knew they were reporting other content creators for having a different opinion I couldn't fw them anymore

-kgYKaEokJ8,"""...in summary he said what amounted to 'fuck around and find out'.""
And that right there is the reason for why the general 'left and right' divide is irreparable and 'the left' are irredeemably evil. To consider the attendance alone of a rally for a candidate whom, even at the absolute worst case take on their culpability in it, spurred a BLOODLESS attempt to overthrow the government he views as working tirelessly against him to the point of corruption as enough of a 'fuck around' moment that it would justify fucking cold-blooded assassination in front of one's wife and child, in the process of defending them from the same, as simply 'finding out'... it's evil bordering on parody, pretty much on par with a fictional villain that the writer goes out of their way to try and FORCE the reader to have zero qualms with killing by the end."

-kgYKaEokJ8,I bet their favorite news site is BBC Pydgin.
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Aba and Preach aren't stupid but from time to time they do have stupid takes. Like this video. Sheesh- it was a doozy. I actually couldn't believe what came out of their mouths, and also the fact that Aba had used a title to insinuate the opposite of his stance. They're usually able to give nuanced and balanced views and make humorous comments about situations. I'm actually not sure why Aba was so adamant about his viewpoint. He even seemed to be aware of how bad it was because he was able to accurately foretell what the general response would be. I agree that, even if someone has a stupid viewpoint on something, they're allowed to have it. But I can't agree with how they defended it and what they were defending. 

Destiny was absolutely foul regarding this situation and incredibly shortsighted. Both Aba and Destiny seem to have forgotten a basic tenet that even school-going children know and understand: 2 wrongs don't make a right. And again, when people in general are in agreement with things we should exercise caution when analysing the stance of the majority, but wisdom would dictate that you should at least listen and then carefully pick apart the arguments in front of you and they felt no need to do that in this video."
-kgYKaEokJ8,"""not my country"" was unexpected since they built their audience with america centered content."
-kgYKaEokJ8,this video was Hilarious
-kgYKaEokJ8,"Yeah, those two really love to fall back on their “outsider” position to defend themselves at times to defend their deliberate attempts to remove context on the points they’re using supporting their views. I used to watch them, but when I noticed that they fell back on using these kinds of tactics more and more, I just stopped watching."

-kgYKaEokJ8,"Aba is Simping for Destiny, its so strange that he is Defending him by Deflecting like this.
its Obvious Bias"
-kgYKaEokJ8,"The hypocrisy is obvious because Aba is a personal friend to Destiny. If this were Sneako or somebody else talking about a Biden assassination attempt and being all for it then you bet your ass Aba would be all for censorship. Hes advocated for it in the past, citing private platform. Now that private platform has bitten Destiny hes suddenly incensed. 

What annoys me most is they clearly want to be on the side of the system but if the system hurts them then they expect you to defend them and their honor. The field mouse does not have to help the snake while it is devouring itself."

Sometimes even ppl/parties of their own little club r part of the ""far right"", like WW2 German socialist party, WW2 Italian socialist party, Soviet Russia, mao, grifter sanders, donkey woman, cop harris, self proven liar warren, pol pot, old hag hillary, venuzuala, cuba, castro jr, etc."

AQt5hDJ7-LA,"What really irks me is this idea that Palestinians somehow displaced indigenous Jews thousands of years ago. The descendants of those Jews still live there, they just converted at some point in history."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bill Clinton is so repellent.  This is a man who is a sexual predator.  Making Monica Lewinski’s life a living hell, flying on the Lolita Express to Jeffery Epstein’s island where young girls were running around in itty bitty bikinis.  After the tragedy in Haiti he brought in food from his state instead of helping Haiti farmers get their own farms up and running.  Going back to the bible to justify Israel stealing land from the Palestinians."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"The only reason Kamala couldnt call Trump a pedo is because of Bill, Trumps former friend and also a pedo."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton is a spokesman for Israel repeating their points. This is the guy that brokered the failed peace negotiations. Look at his bias and racism even today. Now revise your understanding of why the talks failed and what the west has been told.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He did not say that USA and Israel make Hammas and more like them to come if genocide continues

AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Clinton is criminal that had committed more than genocides in iraq because of his actions  , he was the cause of killing hundreds of thousand of iraqi children's by imposing stanchions for periods of all his presidency and now he is lying bout Hamas , Hamas didn't  maskers neither killed  the 1200 Israeli that they claimed in the western media but they got killed  by their own forces from the air and land ."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He said the truth he was the main person there in the negotiations and he’s most poised to know the absolute truth. You’re simply angry because you support kHamas

AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Slick Willy still FOS. Listen - there is only ONE solution to this deranged insanity - the PEACEFULdismantling of Israel. PERIOD. ONE STATE, from the river to the sea. Palestine (or whatever you want to call it). Jews, Muslims, Christians and whoever else wants to live there. One vote and equal rights for each citizen, Anyone pushing a ""2 State"" solution is part of the problem.

hilarious"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,What’s wrong with his position ? It’s true ..and your omitting the fact that Hamas killed civilians who have no power to stop their government either
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Ah, the Democrats—what a brilliant strategy they had. Nothing says ""moral high ground"" like backing genocide while chanting about compassion and empathy. Maybe they thought they’d stumbled upon the magic formula: preach ""democracy"" while cozying up to apartheid and expecting everyone to ignore the glaring horror show in Gaza. After all, why bother mentioning names like Hind Rajab? Better to keep the victims faceless—it makes the denial and deflection so much easier.


And what a spectacularly bold denial it was! Genocide? What genocide? This is just ""Israel defending itself,"" they assured us. ""Self-defense,"" of course, being the perfect label for daily war crimes when it’s your weapons funding them. But hey, let’s not get bogged down in inconvenient details. If you can’t dazzle them with decency, baffle them with doublespeak, right? For those with any remaining shred of morality, this was a line crossed in blood-red ink. Facing a choice between known authoritarianism and the Democrats’ genocide-lite platform, millions decided that their conscience simply wouldn’t allow them to reward these ""humanitarians"" with another four years in office.


But here’s a twist for you: while genocide might be a crowd-pleaser for certain Israeli officials, it turns out it’s not exactly a winning pitch here in the U.S. This little oversight seems to have cost them big. In battleground states, younger voters, the ones who actually cared about human rights, stayed home. Internal polling warned that ending arms sales to Israel was wildly popular, yet the Democrats plowed ahead as if the only constituency they cared about was the weapons industry.


And speaking of integrity, let’s revisit the 2016 primary. Bernie Sanders was clearly resonating with the base, so naturally, they had to rig the process to toss him out in favor of someone more... establishment-friendly. Because why let democracy get in the way of Democratic Party politics? The irony of Bernie and Michael Moore stumping for her was almost Shakespearean. Now we’re all treated to Bernie’s belated ""I told you so,"" as if he hadn’t known all along.


The Democrats’ true nightmare isn’t Trump; it’s the realization that they’re no longer fooling anyone. They were so certain they could package themselves as the ""moral choice,"" but guess what? Americans noticed the hypocrisy. This isn’t on voters. Until the Democrats take real accountability—by kicking out their morally bankrupt DNC leadership, banning every last atrocity propagandist from power, and scrapping this administration’s disgraceful record—they have as much future as a humanitarian award in Netanyahu’s office.


Maybe a primary would have helped. Maybe, just maybe, Americans deserved the option of a candidate who didn’t support genocide. But no, the Democrats figured they’d beat fascism with a platform of denial, hypocrisy, and war crimes denial. They lost that bet, and boy, was it richly deserved."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Wow, Bill does not look healthy!  I have a theory for his behavior here now that I've seen him.   He feels his mortal coil coming to an end and is reverting to a fundamentalist Christianity.  He wants to get right with God before he dies, so he goes to witness to the Canaanites, or whoever he thinks the Arab-Americans are, so that he can die with what he thinks is a clean, or at least an appropriatly remorseful soul."

AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Shame on them for such a repugnant justification to promote genocide, with the audacity to reason this when 70% of those killed are innocent women and children. The Democratic Party must return to its core values of upholding human dignity and protecting the vulnerable."

AQt5hDJ7-LA,you know you are evil when you stand strong for AIPAC over humanity
AQt5hDJ7-LA,what is Clinton talking about??. This man has checked-out. And Bill for the record Gaza is a concentration camp.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,C’est triste de voir ce vieux sans cœur pour le peuple palestinien 🇵🇸🇵🇸❤❤ qu’il est entrain presque de mourir mais il vient raconter des mensonges aux peuples américains 👎🏾👎🏾
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"yes war criminal liar  .... I rather believe that what happened on October 7th is that Israeli soldiers with Apache helicopters carried out a massacre under Hannibal's instructions and that photos have shown that the completely destroyed and burnt cars with missile holes in them could not have come from Hamas weapons. It takes an independent investigation. There were witnesses. I am not an expert but some journalists have demonstrated these things. And it has been shown that Egypt warned Netanyahu and the Mossad too and everything shows that what Netanyahu is doing is a massacre everywhere, that is clear."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Kinda get the feeling he deliberately sabotaged the Harris campaign.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Just thinking. Maybe, just maybe, the deep state didn't want the Democrats to win. Why else would they put Kamala at the helm?  Maybe they have something much more nefarious up their sleeve. Allow the Republicans to gain control and then release the kraken upon the country/world. New pandemic, false flag, black swan. The SHTF scenario. ☢️"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,The arrogance of democrats was the reason they lost election 2024
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Why does Bill Clinton looks and sounds like he got punched in the face?
AQt5hDJ7-LA,This was the stupidest campaign idea. I thought about this. The trash joke about PR- I hoped would balance it out❤️‍🩹
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Dear President Clinton: I have always been a great fan of yours .  I pay great attention to what you say and respect it. You would be surprised to hear that at the beginning of your presidency you invited President Nixon, to the White House to discuss foreign policies and to learn from his experience. I loved it because I said to myself, here is a dedicated President who wants to do a good job and you did. Your speeches were  and still are a delight to hear. You are the best speaker there is, much better than Obama, although he is a great speaker too, but there is still  a big difference. I consider you one of the best American President ever  and certainly the most effective one. You looked at the Presidency as a job and you did everything to succeed. Even when you were attacked from everywhere, you, as you said, you compartmentalized things and still did the best job.  I highly appreciated your foreign policy and stopping the war in Bosnia and Kosovo. You also avoided a carnage in Haiti with the kind help of President Carter that I respect so much. At that time, I was reading religiously newspapers and I noticed that practically no American soldier was killed by hostile fire, not to my knowledge though, and I admired you for that, with the help of President Carter.  Not many Presidents can proud themselves of this achievement.   I followed the Camp David negotiations between Arafat and Ehud Barak. I admired your very hard work to solve the problem. You really did everything to arrive to a solution. You really wanted to succeed and you gave it all you had.  So I understand your frustration because It did not come through as you expected . I have to say that I shared your frustration. But changing one's mind cannot be considered a lie can it?  Was is really a change of mind? I believe that Arafat refused because the right of return for the 750k  displaced Palestinians was not accepted by Barak,  and I don't believe that East Jerusalem was accepted either. I certainly don't remember seeing it as you are saying it. Arafat was afraid that he will be assassinated because of that.  However,  and with regards to this actual speech, I have to say that I am disappointed there are some incomplete info that you needed to say  I wish to tell you and all those who believe that Palestinians or Arabs hate Jews, that is all false. I will prove it. There are Jews everywhere, including in Arab and Muslims countries, but neither you nor anybody else would hear that Jews have been attacked in those countries. Ironically, the only country on earth where Jews are unsafe is Israel. Isn't that odd, especially where Israel was created to keep Jews safe? As you probably know, Arabs and Muslims don't hate Jews, they hate Zionism like almost everybody now does, including many Jews who deny that God gave a land to Jews. Jews did leave in those lands in the past yes but they always lived peacefully with Muslims and Xtians. Muslims don't have an innate hatred of Jews. Prophet  Moses (Peace be Upon Him) is the most mentioned Prophet in the Koran (136 times) versus Prophet Jesus and  Mohammed (Peace be upon them, respectively  25 times and only , 4 times). All Jewish Prophets are mentioned in the Koran including Jesus, with the highest respect and Muslims are OBLIGATED to respect all Prophets and there is a proof of that. Muslims name their children- Moussa (for Moses), Ibrahim(for Abraham), Ishack (for Isaac) Issa (for Jesus) etc.. Naming a child is not compulsory by any law. It is the free will of people to do so. This unequivocally shows how inclusive Muslim religion and Muslims  are. Xtians and Jews are considered people of the Book because they did receive sacred texts that, Muslims are obligated to believe in but those scriptures , were greatly changed by people. That is why Muslims believe Xtians Jews and Muslims have the same God. One cannot be a Muslim if we don't respect  Prophet Jesus, Moses, as well as  all the Prophets from Adam to Mohammed, peace be upon them all. In addition,  Muslims can marry a Xtian or Jewish  woman but not an atheist . Moreover, Islam is the only religion that recognizes Xtianity and Judaism , but Judaism does not recognize  Jesus (peace be upon him). You should read the Torah to see how Jesus is described in the Torah, it is awful. Jews don't recognize Prophet Mohamed, Peace be upon him as well,  not because they did not believe in him but because they knew a Prophet was coming and they were expecting him to be from a Jewish lineage but he came from Ishmael(peace be upon him lineage. They also resented the fact it was not from their tribes plus other reasons. Many if not most Rabbis believe in Islam, the Koran and Prophet Mohammed himself. When Prophet Mohammed reached Madina, after being persecuted by the polytheists, he wrote the first constitution and associated Jews to it. His intention was , we are all in it , we need to look after one another. This means that if any Jewish tribe is attacked, everybody would defend that tribe, and vice versa. Jews were allowed to worship, to have their own culture respected and their own court."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill clinton is a SKUNT 😅😅😅
AQt5hDJ7-LA,will Bill Clinton apply the same logic for the idigenous peoples of America? I very much doubt it
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bimmy clinterton and hill dawg used to be soooo attractive. Best looking couple in murikkkan history I'd argue.

Ewww lol they really let themselves go. He obviously drank too much and she went short troll on us...."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,True
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Lol he made that state go red but folks there still respected Rashidas hard stance and showed up for her haha.

Take notes dems. The people want to vote for a human acting human. Not a demonic out of touch freak who bombs kids, human..."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bill,  get educated about history of Palestine before you come out with your idiotic lecture to Palestinians ,Arabs and Muslims!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,What an Idiot!!!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He has to brag about what he did. You was going to Filiberto Palestine on a silver plater. That why Arafat rejected. And don’t forget that any capotes is Palistenian land  evacuated to build those capotes. You are getting old and fogetasble.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"There is zero love lost between Team Clinton and Team Obama. Remember that Bill Clinton, during the 2008 Presidential primary in which Hillary was running against Obama, said ""five years ago, this guy""- meaning Obama- ""would be getting us coffee"". Obama was the puppet master behind pushing Biden off the ticket and replacing him with Harris and the comments Clinton made about Harris were ways of him getting back at Obama. I do love it when Democrats eat their own."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton is heading where Biden is at. 😂
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Ghastly, corrupt, genocide-enabling, evil globalist PAEDOPHILE."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,EVERY TIME I SEE PEARL DROPS WILLY I JUST SEE HIM SUFFING HIS LEFT LEANING PERONIS PEPPERONI IN MONICA WHILE THE HILDEBEAST SLEPT UPSTAIRS! I CANT UNSEE IT!!!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,AIPAC gifted Bill Clinton with Jewish temptress Monica Lewinsky.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Katie likes Aaron
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Honestly i am terrified of Trump but there's something so satisfying about them losing the election.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"I remember in 1992 the preacher at the Methodist church said “if God meant us to vote, why didn’t He give us a candidate?”  Bill Clinton has been a sleazy PR nightmare from the get go. Without that obscene baggage Hillary would have been President.  His celebration of his sick behavior soured and sunk dignity and decency in the White House. And he loved it!!  No surprises here. But still, I fell complete and utter horror at the continuing sneer he acts out when speaking to us. He has no understanding at all of the things Americans hold dear.  Sanity included. Aint none such thing as sanity visible these days. Nuf said."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"So what? Trump won, it's not a big deal. Dems will regroup and will win the White House again. Who cares about Arab Americans?"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Billy thought more genocide was what people wanted like most zio/Nazis.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton has been always under the payroll of the Zionist state…remember his policy the no fly zone in Irak from 1992 till 2000 and his secretary of state then Madeleine Albright was behind the killing by starvation 500k children Iraqis and she said it was worth the death of the innocent Iraqis…
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"That was the most annoying speech by Bill. 
It shows how disconnected they are with the people"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Wow wow wow Mr. Clinton, I am utterly disgusted with you and all Democrats. Shame on you mf"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bill, time to go home. Should be in Guantanamo."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bad his country history,and hi  think same the another part of world."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,The media will not mention Gaza was one of the main reasons so many  young democrats did not vote for harris ! she supported genocide along with this clown
AQt5hDJ7-LA,In this election Democratic Party whipped out and humiliated for their unconditional support of genocide. Let it be a lesson learned.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Too slick by half, Willy Jeff!😂"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Disgusting liar and war criminal.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Democrats still don't know why they lost , why this happened they ask😂😂"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,I am glad democrat lost this election..... They were so arrogant..
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Aaron is right: Epstein was working for the Mossad. So it's not very difficult to imagine what they have on him. BREAKING NEWS: images of Bill Clinton having sex with a 13-year old.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He is an idiot
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"I was shocked and horrified to listen to what this pervert was saying. First of all he is lying when he says that the settlers living next to Gaza were pro for a two state solution. Does he have a survey?
Secondly, the horrifying comments where he is literally saying that Israel doesn’t have to count as to how many innocent people they can kill in retaliation. 
In other words, kill as many as you like. This is beyond comprehension. I would never thought that an ex president of US could say such words.
I think the US and western countries have made themselves irrelevant now, and the Global South shall emerge, carrying the mantle for every thing humanity stands for. Bye bye the hypocritical imperial powers."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,The land that the Israelis are living on was Palestinian land that the refugees in Gaza were forced off of.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton had to speak. He has been to Lolita 🏝️🏖️🏝️
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Insightful video. Thank you
AQt5hDJ7-LA,_Clinton?_ That's the boy who saw banking and media deregulated on his watch. That was the key to gaining the oligarchs a permanent hold on political power. I _detest_ the man.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"You Bill just like your wife are disgustingly ignorant and corrupt and sold out. 
You are not taking about Palestinians who are killed in thousands???? We should be talking about all human life. 
Not happy trump won
But
Very very happy that Kamala lost"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Clinton, what a shame! this supposedly intelligent man, he served two terms what a fraud!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,bill clinton lost his mind when he tried to excuse the murder of innocent palestinians.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Biden Starmer Nethanyahu Macron trump Clinton et al are coward rats compared to Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniya, Hassan Nasrullah"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Muslims think this election had something to do with them lol, no one gives AF."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"This pedophile clinton is so sick and so deranged. He is saying it is ok to shread palestinian babies because the prison break caused to kill so called israeli famillues. This monster dies he know that how many nakba has killed thousands of palestinian famillies. And they took their land and kill the palwstinian chikdren and women in a daily basis. So for him palestinian has no right to defend themslves, even they have been slaughtered for 75 years in a daily basis. So disgusting to hear this by this old creepy creature."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He was the wrong surrogate to send to talk to the Arab community in MIchigan
AQt5hDJ7-LA,I could guess why Bill has been lying for 24 years. I'd guess it's because he's caught on tapes from the Epstein island and has to serve his master so the truth doesn't come out. But that's just a guess. ;-)
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Are you happy now???you did it to yourself!!! Hamas and Iranian terrorists are walking FREELY in are campuses. I did not vote for Trump. But I HATED voting for my WEAK party. WEAK response to this WOKE, terrorist FAKE two states solution(which the Islamic TERRORISTS will never accept).FALSESTINE flags on Brooklyn bridge??? really?? 

You did it to yourself, and now you will get a convicted felon, and America prefers HIM on any terrorists operating on are LAND."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,HAHAHAHA... I think Katie's theory is right. LOL
AQt5hDJ7-LA,One friend of Jeffrey Epstein helps another.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill Clinton's dumbest speech?
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Blinken Maxwell Clinton.
All linked to the same dead guy"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Egypt also doesn’t let Palestinians leave Gaza. Stop ignoring that
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Guess what, Bill, Christians were the ones who expelled Jewish people from this land. The Muslims seized it from the Romans and the Muslims were the ones who invited the Jewish people to return to it. This has been the case throughout history. Christians going after Jews, and Muslims providing home and protection for them. Get some education before you die, Bill."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Thank you Bill❤
AQt5hDJ7-LA,BILL IS BEING PAID FOR SPEWING THESE WORDS.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,8:15 Bingo!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"The left wing did a great job exposing themselves. They fooled us into thinking they’re not fascists and blood thirsty war mongers like the right wing, until Gaza exposed everyone, from east to west. Free Free Palestine 🇵🇸"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"I know it doesn’t matter, but where did he get the idea that Israelis bordering Gaza supported the two state solutions???!!!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton is an idiot why would any one wants this guy to rally for him or her
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"All the living POTUS voted for Trump, except for Obama, who voted kamala. Biden wore the MAGA hat, and none showed up to congratulate kamala if she won at the election rally. Shh just saying the quiet part out loud."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"They were also juifs in Northeast Africa, so is Africa next for the Zionism colonization?"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Imagine at this age ,he supporting genocide.....full of lies and arrogance"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He is over the hill
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Usually Presidents after they retired they try to cleanse them self out of sin they did by doing human works, this one got him self deeper in Hell."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Indeed he did.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Your name “useful idiots” is appropriate. Hamas and co reject peace deals and knowingly involve Palestinian citizens for the optics of oppression. If I had a child that was being held hostage next door that threatened to kidnap the rest of my family, I would have to make the choice of lose one innocent life, or all my family, there would be a vacant lot in an estate sale"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Clinton is as coherent as Biden, which is to say incoherent."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"how can any Muslim sit there and listen to him and his bss. 

I would have walked out at the very least!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Disgraceful paedo, release the Epstein files"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Next.....
AQt5hDJ7-LA,What a useless piece of human waste.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bill talks nonsense. If you caged people for more than 70 years, what are you going to if you got a chance."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,That means American aborigines have the right to kill all whites and others migrated and occupied their land. What a buffoon he is!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,These people still think us total idiots! What a buffoon he is!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill clinton is nothing like his wife hilary
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Trump must have reserved an expensive gift for him, about 65% people from his state (Arkansas) voted for Trump."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Epstein effect lingering even in vegetables
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Disgusting!  Clinton seems more demented than Biden and Trump!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Free American people from Aipac...!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"The icing on the cake was when the Republicans won Arkansas, the Clinton's county.😂"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Clinton allowed genocide in Srebrenica 95' happened, he is well educated on taking a part of killings Muslim population around world."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill Clinton undoubtedly damaged any credibility the Muslim voters had  in Democratic Party.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He is still under the influence of the meeting he had with Lewinski in oral office😂
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton said the people who stole Palestinian land are the most friendly to the Palestinians that’s how you know the Jeffrey Epstein island isreal 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton used to have great political instincts but he showed during Hilary’s campaign that he was no longer that guy. Around that time some people close to him said he had not been the same after his heart surgery. Clearly his recent remarks were counter-productive and negative for Harris.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"The old testament is a lie, and the New Testament was written to verify the lie,. There were not Muslims 2000 yrs. ago. However,they were all semites, and it is possible semite jews converted to muslim. The Jews have caused trouble and massacred their neighbors for millenia. It occurred in Crete among other places. The fact that they were rebellious to the Romans does not mean the Romans mistreated them."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"It must be the b.j from that nice Zionists 

Hehehehe 

Rotten all the to his death bed


Birds of a feather 

Him Hillary 


She said who ever gave the right to Palestinians  to vote!!


Sick couple"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Why would you have a nonse and war criminal stand and speak for you. Trump didn't win, Harris lost, I'm glad she lost, I'm glad the so called Democrats lost. The world is on fire and all she does is laugh and smile. Well, she isn't smiling anymore. Maybe is you'd stop arming israel, you may have won.....idiots. trump will probably be worse so when the globe is a pile of ashes, you've only got yourselves to blame"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Like Biden Clinton does not get it, hence Trump who half gets it but, he better make sure the two state solution is the minimum requirement for peace. Otherwise, the bloodshed continues."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Democrats are done!! The young people won’t vote for genocide!!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"This is crazy how can these minds be soo foolish Clinton is such disgusting 🤮 
And to think I used to be great supporter during his election what a waste"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Jeffrey Epstein's video and photographs made  Clinton made this speech
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Those in the kibbutz don't broadly want peace, nor the kind of peace clinton talks about, they just know a war would force them to leave the land they occupy.  and israel uses them as human shields by enticing them to occupy land, so when Palestinians try to return, the army kills the latter saying it's ""self defense"", same playbook from the 60s.  The notion that israelis were there first is also bull, Palestinians have more genetic ancestry to the semitic people and remained after jewish kingdoms fell from infighting, they simply stopped following judaism.  the modern jews come from a diaspora that led them to primarily mix with the europeans and become more naturalized to that region over thousands of years.  Regardless, it's a disgusting argument to make, because we are all people trying to live in the world, and western policies and ideas are holding humanity back because of all the lives and land it ruins."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,I cringed so hard when I saw this video of bill. It doesn’t get much more out of touch than that. Also the “Clinton body count” disqualified him and Hillary from commenting from any moral authority on anything regarding loss of lives
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Epstein is smiling with pride from the grave. Clinton's speech is the fruit of Jeff's labor.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Thank you, Bill. I'm sure you warrant their respect. No."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,P4lestinians are the genetical descendants of Bronze Age Levant; they are the one who have been there first long before Europeans
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"We loved Bill Clinton, he helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland, we will never forget that, Ireland loved you for that!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Congratulations- you Almost single handedly sunk Kamala’s election.  Your wife took just shy of 2.5 million of campaign contributions from AIPAC when she ran in 2016. Clinton knows nothing about what he’s talking about.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Jewish Professor Avi Shlaim’s books and verbal reports have been available for years. Our leading politicians/rulers have ignored essential research. If only the brutal deadly torture of Palestinians by Israeli nationalists should have stopped long ago, resistant movements would not exist. Our rulers are ignorant of Avi Shlaim’s work. I assume that you know of Avi Shlaim, an Arab Jew who enlightens us on these issues."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Clinton's speech was the most racist speech I've ever heard in my entire life. 

This war exposed everybody's true nature."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Actually the Arabs have always been there and won God’s confidence and covenant, while the Jews where there for a short time, and continuously were disowned by God for their constant disobedience, the remnants of which we see today, in which the vast majority of Jews use the words God, morals, and decency, yet have none in their 76 year old constant thievery and lies.
Does God bless such a nation of thieves and criminals?
I think not."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Shame on you Clinton for supporting Genocide! Your speech is criminal! How much is the Israeli lobby paying you?
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"So professing undying love for Jews alienated other voters and lost them the election. The irony being that, whoever won, the Jews would still win. They aren't beholden solely to Kamala or Trump"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"A pedophile rapist that visited Epstein‘s Island at at least 26 times inaccurately used biblical “history” to condescend and justify genocide, what a joke"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He should stayed quiet will be better
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Jullianos intoxicated speech, trying to blame Palestinians for indoctrinating their children from Two year olds to kill, projecting from the laws of the Israelis, who teach their kids that Palestinians are animals and need to be exterminated like animals!
Juliano exposed himself for the devil that he is!
Then we had Clinton, another hater of Palestinians, a proven liar try to blame Palestinians on everything, say that Arafat was a liar, when in fact he was the liar! This guy Clinton is going to meet his maker very soon, just like Biden, Obama, Pompeo, Trump and all those evil entities!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Clinton's speech was both dumb and disgusting. If the goal was to get some Arabs/Muslims to vote for Kamala, he failed miserably! Pathetic!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,I think Israel has got a video of Clinton made by Jeffrey Epstein on the Island and passed on to them.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton is talking to Arabs Americans like he knows more about the situation over there then they do. Hamas attack was to mainly to abduct mainly Israeli soldiers. I remember the speech he gave when Hamas got elected in a fair election. Hillary is on record asking why we did not make sure a more friendly government elected. They were unwilling to accept that democratic process that elected Hamas and approach and connect with Hamas.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"The Jewish people who lived in Palestine 2,000 years ago are now Paleatinian Muslim. The indigenous people of Palestine still live there."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bibi having a DVD collection of this seasoned Epstein Islander doesn't fully explain his ""position"". 
It's just that he's Clinton i.e. corrupt to the core."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Oh lawddd, a former president of YOUASS of A is using fictional book to justify the erasure of a people 🤦🏽"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Money and power makes a blind man an evil.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,And now some anonymous Dems (according to NBC News) want to “bring Carville back” as a leading adviser for the next prospective nominee in their party. No… just no.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Democrats need to abandon every trace of neoliberalism. Clintons, Obamas, Kennedys. Leave them all behind. Abandon the elites and all corporate media and corporate money."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"i dont understand the people still there just hear they abuse,,this men is rapist 26 times in flight with espien"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill Clinton morally stupid
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill explaining October 7 to Palestinian-Americans. 😂
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"I love Jews, but I hate Zionists!"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Secretary of State and National Security Advisor must be in sync in order to have peace through strength there is no other way but to structure as a round table. You have logistics diplomacy strategic and from them you can form doctrine and directives without depending on things out of your scope of knowledge.

Tom Cotton 
Has experience in “Distribution of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs)”

Richard Grenell
“If you want to avoid war, you better have a son of a bitch as the secretary of state,” Mr. Grenell said in a March episode of “Self Centered,” a current events podcast. America needs a “tough” chief diplomat, he said, “who goes in to these tables and says: ‘Guys, if we don’t solve this here, if we don’t represent peace and figure out a tough way, I’ve got to take this file, go back to the United States and transfer it to the secretary of defense, who doesn’t negotiate. He’s going to bomb you.’”

Robert O’Brien
""It's always an honor to serve the country and to serve the president. But I’m not campaigning for a job,"" he said. ""There are a lot of really great people who'd like to work for the president.""
The way out of the war, according to O’Brien, is through the negotiating table, and steeper sanctions are needed to cripple Russia’s economy and bring them to the table.  ""The sanctions have been relatively minor,"" O’Brien said. ""They haven’t sanctioned the Russian Federation Central Bank. They haven’t kicked folks out of SWIFT. They’ve taken a few oligarchs’ yachts."" 

Mike Waltz
His commitment in Washington, D.C. is the same now as it was in combat: To serve with everything he has, without regard for his own self and with a sense of duty.

All of these men if you put them and only them inside an enclosed conference room and you charge them for a solution or a way out they will offer you the solutions. I dont think the secretary of state should work separately from the national security in regards to a bureaucratic structure. Those guys above probably do their best for the situation you ask them if you put them in a round table, leave them on their own, and when you come back the will give you the best advice consistent.

I see Mike Waltz-a loyal green beret in National Security 
I see Secretary of State in Robert O’Brien and Richard Grenell. Whoever it is better be able to fly all over the world and have the stamina and the work ethic to deal with a future WW3 scenario which I am certain will manifest but it doesnt not have to effect the US homeland if one of the above can understand this paragraph.

This advice is from a few others"
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton is a monster too. Viva Palestine.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,My mother used to say - no one will think you are a mute when you do not say anything.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill Clinton is a racist idiot !!!
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Just made a truthful comment about Israel and it's been taken down.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Gaza was 100% not occupied on Oct 6th and Egypt keeps the blockade on Gaza because they support terrorism and rocket launching rather then water pipes. Aaron is a cuck
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Thank you hamassimps for helping Trump win - 🇮🇱 🇺🇸 🇮🇱- if only you two were in those Kibbutz supporting the Gazans. They would have loved to meet you both 😂😂😂
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Israel DOES NOT support a 'homeland for the Palestinians, and THAT is the problem."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Like trump needed any of bills help. It was obvious Trump would win back 3 years ago and in my view they cheated trump in 2020.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,"Bill and Hillary Clinton received 10s of millions from Aipac, and other Jewish interests groups, why would anyone think that the Clinton's would be on the Palestine People's corner? The Clinton's right now are paving the way for Chelsea Clinton and are making sure that she'll get Aipac, Jewish money when she runs in the future for any political office."
AQt5hDJ7-LA,He’s a corrupt puppet. I just wonder if Monica was in the audience
AQt5hDJ7-LA,This is not new. They’ve been helping each other for years. Bill was helping him tag team twelve year olds at Epstein island since the nineties.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Kamal should thank Clifton for her defeat.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,I cannot believe I voted for Bill Clinton when I was young. My eyes are opened on how he or likes of him think.
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Clinton is talking like a demented Joe  Biden
AQt5hDJ7-LA,Bill and Donny are friends
AQt5hDJ7-LA,This is the first time in 38 years that I did not vote for a single Democrat.
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Yes he is  you can go back to  the  Vietnam  War  for  proof. 
Zero  c limate  change  is  a con. Proof AL GORES VIDEO  AT END  THE  GARPH PROVES. KEEP YOU FEELS OUT."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Unfortunately, we only have two choices.  Who would you rather?"
g0iXBHrQKjk,How is he supposed to  know about  all that.
g0iXBHrQKjk,They R projecting everything  . Everything  as in they are all  fa csist  and  they  are  going to  slam the  door on us  . Who's awake and  can  get the message  out  I don't have the  internet.  Can't  get on major apps to do anything  .misson  creep
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Trump doesn’t mind war so much . He just doesn’t like paying for them ,"
g0iXBHrQKjk,I really enjoy listening to these two breakdowns
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Neocons support for the so called Democrat party should be an embarrassment, but of course it's not. Turns out it's helpful to Trump 😂😂. Vance is an effective brick wall, Tapper is a simp. The  controll mechanism is missing a wheel...Trump has gained by appearing to be above the fray, but he isn't. Vance is clearly brighter than Tapper... it's a circus. But the pistols are real."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"This shows how corrupt the corporate media is. In interview with a so-called journalist should not end up being a debate. 
Or, at the very minimum, it should be exactly as aggressive no matter which candidate is being interviewed. 

And yet we know if that criminal Tapper had down with Walz or Kamala, it would be a puff piece."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"I was fed this channel on my feed after visiting pro-Putin channels... that makes this channel very suspect... confirmed by showing clips of JD Vance, puppet of billionaire Thiel..."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"hahaha you should be ashamed supporting Trump and Vance, they are both huge zios who will do whatever Bibi wants 😂"
g0iXBHrQKjk,"""So, you're telling me these 11 known war mongers, are in fact war mongers?
That's really your argument?"""
g0iXBHrQKjk,"The general officer corps is a high-speed conveyor belt straight onto large defense contractor retirement boards, who make billions when the US is involved in as many wars as possible."
g0iXBHrQKjk,Nothing like an open border to Fight Terrorism. 😂😂😂😂
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Trump not only tried to pull out of Syria, he also attempted to bring peace to Korea, to some degree, and is totally against neocon worldview on Ukraine, a position that is really not serving him any real good."
g0iXBHrQKjk,He thinks is interesting that a magazine writer is implicated in promoting war because Tapper wants to say Vence is pro incarcerating journalists.
g0iXBHrQKjk,"If they be a 'poli',  and they lips be movin', then they be a lyin'.  Den, dey be a pointing dat der finger at de other."
g0iXBHrQKjk,Maybe add your commentary _after_ we listen to them talk instead of interrupting them every few seconds to go on and on about whatever.
g0iXBHrQKjk,"You guys did a really good job of breaking the argument and psychology down to a basic level 😂 it makes me physically feel anger listening to their lies because its on 12 hrs a day in my house.

Funnily enough thats exactly how the so called libs in my family react when you try to present them with any sort of information that frames whoever they like in a negative way, or fact check the things they tell me."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"JD Vance is not a warhawk.
As someone who was in the military, and actually went there, he is a much better judge of the situation than a paid toad tapper.
Vance is the best insurance policy for Trump to remain breathing."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Some truth…..

Your brain is broken. Pathetic clownery."
g0iXBHrQKjk,You got to be kidding me. She has so much more money than the republicans. She's losing because she has no message and no policy.
g0iXBHrQKjk,Conglomerate stooges spotting fascists is lame
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Tapper is a juice. NEVER anything come before their tribe and their unrelenting dee en aye. Peace, justice NOTHING."
g0iXBHrQKjk,tapper needs to be in prison
g0iXBHrQKjk,J.D. Vance did well.
g0iXBHrQKjk,"This critique of Vance is attempting to be cerebral and knowledgeable instead of assessing the effectiveness of the interview to support the red corporation positions and defeat the blue corporation.
It's either disingenuous or intellectually dishonest at best, or just plain idiotic to criticize for not starting wars by criticizing his heavy handed political methods of _not starting wars._ 

What would make sense today is to use their ""nuanced"" views to accept that when you have a computer virus, you stop running software and you stop downloading and installing software, you don't ""well, some software is good, so we have to allow all software to be assumed good until it … kills people and crashes planes into builds"" … the very temporary flight restrictions on some nationalities (not religions, that's just dishonest it was a ""ban on Muslims"" that's just inflammatory and untrue) was a heavy-handed method of preventing a catastrophe in the midst of running the CIA/FBI/NSA anti-virus operations before allowing entry of people from countries known to be the home of terrorists moving about other countries for the purpose of terrorist attacks.

Aside from the unintelligent and uneducated devotees of Trump, I think most of his supporters recognized he's not everything he claims to be, he's just going to be who he was for the first four years he was President: mostly harmless. If Trump follows through and allows RFK Jr. to ""make America Healthy again"" and Musk uses his genius for problem-solving to balance the budget and cut the most excessive waste and the opinions of patriots like Tulsi Gabbard are heard in the Oval Office and she's allow to pursue programs to support Americans in need of government services (Maui of course, Flint, Florida, Puerto Rico, numerous other regions still unaided after various disasters from storms and floods to wildfires) doesn't that all add up to the potential for the next four years to result in a much better place for all Americans and perhaps most people on the planet? 

For immigrants, Trump won't be deporting a million or tens of millions of people, but he will probably deport most of the people intent upon doing harm … terrorists and Venezuelan drug gangs for examples … but he'll build all of that wall and it will be there for a hundred years and I imagine it will become only more necessary in the next hundred years as South America is not about to balance out and become a place where millions of people in a dozen countries currently in chaos without stable governments, without even stable electrical grids let alone hospitals and schools and housing and jobs wouldn't rather walk into the USA and find somewhere to live and somewhere to work, bringing the problems with them.

The most striking issue in this interview with Vance is the thing the *_Useful Idiots_* should have addressed as the important observation: JD Vance took an attack on Trump and turned it into a convincing argument that would sway voters towards Trump, he was able to deflect one lie after another including legitimate criticisms and replace them with credible ideas. JD Vance is helping Trump get elected. He's also clearly already capable of being the successor to Trump, which is a whole 'nother consideration: if Trump is going to be President again, he can either leave the country in crippling debt and numerous wars, or he can use the people and resources to improve the country so that JD Vance is the next President, giving Trump an ongoing control in a rather Obama-like way. 

In four years time, Trump will be the one who brought Musk, Kennedy, Gabbard (the ""MKG"") into his administration, brought Vance into position to be the next POTUS and will still be in a position to influence their behavior in the first term of Vance. Trump becomes unkillable. Even if the ""they"" assassinate Trump as President, Vance will continue the same policies and governance. Even if they somehow took out Vance as well, MKG and Trump's administration would continue in their work.

I think if the blue corporation can control the election outcome, it's not ""the last election"", I think it becomes the first four years of a change in voter behavior that the 2028 process will be the landslide and culture change that breaks down the oligarchy and rebalances or even replaces the duopoly. Whether that happens this term or next, the ""change is coming"" the voters elected with Obama under false pretenses and the origin of song lyrics from last century will happen."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Vance needs to be applauded for his knowledge, rhetorical skill, and calm articulation. Not many people could navigate as skillfully as he does through this assaultive interview by a blatantly biased journalist. (And not once did he remind us that he's from a middle-class family!)"
g0iXBHrQKjk,I’m FREE PALESTINE and also TRUMP 2024. Actions speak louder than words. The lesser of two evils is BY FAR Trump.
g0iXBHrQKjk,Supposedly Mark Milley had to walk Trump back from bombing Iran's nuclear facilities. Very peaceful guy.
g0iXBHrQKjk,"calling Trump being a sycophant is a little unfair , how about Trump trying to stay alive ."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Walk softly and carry a big stick:
Bolton was Trump’s big stick !?
In addition to being a big dick lol"
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Trump is just unpredictable,he would go to war with Iran or China so its no real difference"
g0iXBHrQKjk,JD Vance is 1000% right.
g0iXBHrQKjk,Well done guys.. Refreshing to watch a political conversation that doesn't ignore the truth to bend towards party affiliation..
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Two points:  first, on the subject of Trump and war, I believe Trump has a strong disposition of discomfort with conflict, not from idealism, but because, as a businessman, he tends to look at everything in terms of economic competition, and to see war as wasteful, which it is.  Second, I believe Vance somewhat knowingly exaggerates Trump's peaceful disposition by calling him the ""candidate of peace,"" both to distinguish Trump from the neocons and the neoliberal hegemonists, but also to encourage Trump to go in this direction.  Vance is the candidate who makes Karl Rove shake with rage."
g0iXBHrQKjk,How do you lose to HIM?  JD Vance is such an idiot that the brilliant Jake Tapper should wipe the floor with his hillbilly ass.
g0iXBHrQKjk,“Some truth that the deep state tried to undermine Trump” seriously this guy is suffering from some TDS!
g0iXBHrQKjk,"The Atlantic once published a decent article called ""JFK vs The Military"" about his struggles with the top military and Pentagon brass. After the Bay of Pigs debacle, JFK no longer trusted them and essentially started to ignore them. Found them to be complete psychopaths. This is what any President is dealing with. Question is, do you fall into line like Bush and Obama did, or do you risk getting JFK'd or Trump'd?"
g0iXBHrQKjk,"This conversation should be 3-4x longer.  I really enjoy listening to the truth which we rarely hear from our Lying Corporate Government, Lying Corporate MSMs, and so many scams on YouTube. 

Google is also so bad with so many lies (incredible lies)."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Jake Tapper is complete and utter trash! Vence I do not admire by any imagination, but CNN and Tapper and rest of shoddy crew..."
g0iXBHrQKjk,I've been skeptical of Vance for other reasons but on this one he did pretty good against a well established Warfare State Sycophant.  Well done Katie and Aaron.
g0iXBHrQKjk,Thank you both your great work
g0iXBHrQKjk,"2:40 How the heck do you allow your subordinates to undermine your order as Commander in Chief of the US?

You must be extremely incompetent and empty-souled to not be interested to ask a single attorney how to enforce your order. Or to not blast the insubordination publicly until they submit."
g0iXBHrQKjk,Tapper is a thing??
g0iXBHrQKjk,We need 0rf to make a compilation of all the lies in this
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Lindsey Graham and Mike Pompayo are definitely worst kinds of chicken hawks. It’ll be the greatest test for the real isolationists and America First people on Trumps inner circle, whether they can resist the war hawks when they get to white house. If they do, Graham and Pompeyo will join the choir shouting faschist."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"For all honesty, there must be zero possibilities to run for office if you're against Israel. You'd have every instance and billionare there is against you. Elon had to do an apology tour and kiss the ring due to being 'antisemitic'. Almosty everybody is a double citizen and according to Massie everybody has their own AIPAC person. Israel backers are the richest people on earth. The networth of Rotchild's and the like is obviously hidden because there is no way the children inherited that little what was openly told."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"*What about Chase Oliver?*

g0iXBHrQKjk,"JD is actually smart, and quick on his feet, unlike most politicians. Tapper is reading a list a talking points that could have been prepared by the CIA. Thats how he lost."
g0iXBHrQKjk,I think there are many members of minority groups who support Trump just to give the democrats the two fingers British salute. See ”Are you being served?”  for a fine demonstration by captain Peacock.
g0iXBHrQKjk,Katie! Loved attending last nights talk with you and Rashid Khalidi!
g0iXBHrQKjk,"FFS, guys, Lindsey Graham has *never* been Trump's ally! If you've read Bob Woodward's ""Peril,"" you know that Graham had the job of being one of Trump's main handlers -- a Svengali/Iago figure there to manage and thwart Trump (like most of his cabinet, CoS Kelly, his neocon generals, his treacherous VP, and Bill Barr). Trump talks like a damn Nazi, and I would never vote for the man or advocate that others do so, but he was the first POTUS in decades to start no new wars -- and did a great deal to promote diplomacy and withdraw the U.S. from its existing wars and illegal occupations... as Christian Parenti has reported. 

(Try to be a little objective, can't you? The Dem-favoring, ""both-sides"" equivocation bit is getting tiresome.)"
g0iXBHrQKjk,It’s interesting to observe how much more articulate and at ease Mr. Vance is in front of an adversary than he is in front of a crowd of supporters.
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Aaron, you look very sexy and hot unshaved."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"It’s like Godwin’s law has become a political campaign.

At this point, Harris should simply change her official campaign slogan to: “Genocide Schmenocide, If You’re Voting for Donald ‘No New Wars’ Trump, You’re a Nazi!”

(Now, back to butchering women and children…)

And for all of the Team Blue adherents inclined to argue that Trump will (somehow) make the genocide worse, let me remind you that, between Trump and Harris, he’s the only one who’s said he would have asked Netanyahu to stop the carnage.

From an ABC News report earlier this year:

Trump: ""I wanted to call [Israel] and say don’t do it. These photos and shots. I mean, moving shots of bombs being dropped into buildings in Gaza… that’s a terrible portrait. It’s a very bad picture for the world. The world is seeing this… Every night, I would watch buildings pour down on people... Go and do what you have to do. But you don’t do that.”

That said, Trump also said “finish the job,” and I certainly don’t trust the man who uses “Palestinian” as a slur to do the right thing, re: Gaza.

My main point is that the establishment stalwarts who’ve been recklessly tossing around “Hitler” comparisons – for years and years, comparing everyone from Saddam Hussein to Vladimir Putin to Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders to Hitler – are simply the “Boy Who Cried Wolf” at this point."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Nope that's not what happened.  In the interview with Joe Rogan Trump says John Bolton was a ""Bad Guy"" and his friend who is good at cards blah blah blah said ""Everything with that guy ends badly"".  And Trump said well I had already hired the guy, but that he was ""insane"" or ""nuts"" something like that.  

Later oooon Trump said that Mike Pompeo was a good guy which I found interesting, but I'm no expert.  When I heard that I thought he was talking about John Bolton because I get the two people confused for some reason.  Also in general in the Joe Rogan interview Trump said his biggest mistake was taking cabinet suggestions that were neocons or just ""bad people"".   And that he had no idea that he would actually win.

I think also it should be noted that they talked about the elections on Joe Rogan, the integrity of the elections, and imo that is one of the most important issues we should be investigating and talking about nonstop.  Because voting means nothing if we have all these systems in place which only support oligarchy."
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Trump has spent his entire political career denouncing the neocon wars – one of the few things he’s been consistent on.

In office, Trump negotiated the end of the USA’s longest war, setting the May 1, 2021 withdrawal date with the Taliban, effectively tying Biden’s hands. Trump’s diplomacy with the Taliban yielded an 18-month period with no attacks on U.S. soldiers, as Bob Woodward reported in his book “Peril.”

And although he shredded some important treaties, he frequently practiced diplomacy.

Christian Parenti, longtime progressive, anti-war journalist has argued that the real reason our neo-fascist political-media establishment loathes Trump is because he’s the most war-averse/anti-empire POTUS in generations.

From Parenti's 2/15/23 article in the Grayzone (maybe Aaron has heard of this publication):

- “Trump undertook the most momentous rollback of American military and diplomatic power since the current architecture of American informal empire first took form…”

- “Trump campaigned on an end to ‘nation building’ and then, amazingly, set about actually winding down America’s ‘forever wars’ by simply packing up and leaving. Nor did he start any new wars. Trump cut the number of US troops in Iraq by almost half. In Afghanistan, he cut the US occupation force by half and negotiated a framework for total withdrawal. He tried to end US combat deployments in both Somalia and Syria, and in both cases, despite Pentagon opposition and slow-walking noncompliance, Trump did manage to withdraw the majority of US personnel.”

- “Trump went after US operations in Germany and South Korea, threatening highly strategic lynchpins in the global system of US military power. He also made great strides towards normalizing relations with North Korea and producing a peace treaty on the Korean peninsula. In Libya, he declined to escalate and worked with Russia towards a peace settlement.”

- “Trump repeatedly expressed his wish to remove the US from NATO, which would have destroyed NATO if it had been done. If NATO fell apart, the entire US-centered global system – that is, the largest, most effective, complex, and expensive imperial project in world history – would undergo a seismic destabilization.”

- “In January 2019, when Trump ordered US troops withdrawn from Syria, [Gen. Jim “Mad Dog” Mathis] resigned.”

Parenti describes how Trump was surrounded by document-stealing, order-defying rogue officials who “worked to actively thwart” the elected President of the United States.

That claim is certainly supported by Stephanie Grisham’s (anti-Trump) insider book, “I’ll Take Your Questions Now,” and Bob Woodward’s “Peril” (also heavily biased against Trump).

All told, Parenti makes a pretty compelling case, does he not?"
g0iXBHrQKjk,"TRUMP said he only found out how warhawk-like Bolton was until AFTER he hired him.  Said he wouldn't have if he knew.  

Only said that people were thrown off balance because Bolton was there and were afraid of his views."
g0iXBHrQKjk,“very hard to find a term that hasn’t lost its meaning” Aaron Mate failing to see the irony
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Worth adding trumps ""Muslim ban"" was a targeted terrorist/refugee ban bc the msm was encouraging us to take in tons of Syrian and other war refugees. He improperly used the term ""Muslims"" early on"
g0iXBHrQKjk,"While I again voted Green, it has grown easier to discount the DEM hypocritical cries to 'defend democracy' by demonizing Trump.  Clinton, Obama, AOC, discredited general officers, and now even Bernie Sanders claiming Harris (Biden) Administration is the example of what government should be.
We need the social-political-economic analogy to Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences, a list of propositions for an academic disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, then a professor of moral theology, to analyze what should be chosen in the 21st century."
g0iXBHrQKjk,No new wars under Trump. Can’t argue with that.
g0iXBHrQKjk,"All presidents are meant to be prevetted and subservient to those they are prevetted to serve...the establishment which has agendas prior to, during, and after every president who are meant to be the public puppet they make dance...Trump is not their choice he lipped in by mistake...He will be gone in 4 years...meanwhile the public mass incarceration goes on...be a part of the enforcers or be the focus of their work."

g0iXBHrQKjk,"I have to disagree, Trump doesn't like mass killings. I believe it was John Bolton that pressured Trump to take out a terrorist in Iran and Trump said that would kill a hundred civilians he wouldn't do it, right afterwards Bolton left the administration."
g0iXBHrQKjk,🌺🦋🌺🦋

g0iXBHrQKjk,"Useful Idiots i appreciate u so mcha, thank u. Good chuckles"
g0iXBHrQKjk,"Trump is a deal maker. He openly decried the fact that Netanyahu and company were not intent on a deal for peace. Like his attempt with North Korea, he wants to bring about peace through negotiation. He has to deal with the parties he’s been dealt. He does the carry a big stick thing often to the table, which was pretty much his approach to Ukraine while at the same time diminishing the threat of NATO."

PRESIDENTS DON'T HAVE MUCH CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY. GET OVER IT.

I love you.

Edit:
I should have also added that Biden released oil reserves in coordination with Congress. That has likely helped inflation come back down. Early on in his presidency, Biden also signed an executive order prohibiting new drilling for fossil fuels on federal public lands. That definitely didn’t help inflation go down.

A5sfLIznSjI,Oh I remember this guy years ago I said he sounds just like idubbz
A5sfLIznSjI,"Trump is different, Presidents can unilaterally impose tariffs. If Trump actually does tariffs up to 60% for certain goods like he said he would, you will see the economy being affected."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Also worth noting: ""the economy"" is one of the least controversial answers a voter can provide when asked (especially publicly) why they voted a certain way.

A5sfLIznSjI,Cmom biden’s push for the inflation reduction act as well as the war in ukraine which was 100 percent provoked by biden didnt cause massive amounts of inflation? I’d go as far as to say the extreme policies that the left pushed for covid was also an attempt to get trump out of power. Which also forced trumped to do things that caused inflation. This video is based on the theoretical in reality politics rule the world and the world’s economy. Also saying the president doesn’t have that much power on the economy is crazy. Almost every book documentary or docuement based on the 2008 recession starts with presidents signing laws to make it easier for people who shouldnt own homes to be able to buy them. For political reasons. There is no larger single force in the economy than the president of the united states. I know businesses that had to wait to see who the next president was before they could do business. These are mom and pop shops.

The Gov is Under Control by the World Orginazation.All Laws are Passed down to them Every 4 Years they have to Elect a New President   If the New Elect is not Doing the Job After 4 Years He is Kicked out Then The Voting Polls are Open 2 Sides are Competing for the Race according to the Debate and who is the Best Mouth Piece is Selected By the World Orginazation The United Nations. Voting is Just an Adgender .
A5sfLIznSjI,Trump's poor handling of Covid definitely did not help the recession.  I don't think it's unfair to say that Trump was responsible for a lot of the damage done.
A5sfLIznSjI,I remember seeing a few articles (in june) about how the “covid 19 recession” actually started in February of 2020 we were heading into one regardless and covid just ramped it up.
A5sfLIznSjI,Trump was riding off the fruitfull economy obama left. And HIS a$$ was implementing mass deportations.
A5sfLIznSjI,15:58 I think I got one in my back yard. It might need a new flux capacitor though 😂
A5sfLIznSjI,"The president has the most influence on the economy. Presidents write and propose every budget. Congress amends it and sends it back. The president signs it or vetoes it. If the president's party has a majority in Congress his budget stays about the same. If the opposition controls Congress they restrict the president's spending.

Covid was Trump's fault because he disbanded our pandemic response team in China and reduced our CDC presence in  China by two thirds. He also called it a hoax and didn't take it seriously for a year."
A5sfLIznSjI,Dishonest... Appointees can very much be a tool of aa President
A5sfLIznSjI,Can't believe people really think a country like the *US* is some sort of Planned Economy like the Soviet Union lmfao
A5sfLIznSjI,Annoying background sound
A5sfLIznSjI,could you make a video discussing the tariffs trump could possibly put in place?
A5sfLIznSjI,"The things you entirely missed. 
Tariffs and carbon tax do cause inflation 
foreign spending do cause inflation 
starting new wars do cause inflation 
sending foreign aid to other countries do cause inflation 
putting we taxpayers money into welfare state do cause inflation 
Shutting down coal and energy sources do lead to rise in prices across the board 
Trump gave significant tax cuts to the middle class, so it cancelled out the inflation 
while if Biden had made the student loans from tax payers money it would have driven inflation more glad that supreme court interevened
Now that trump have more power on the supreme court, senate and the presidency he will have direct effect on the economy !"
A5sfLIznSjI,"It’s kinda like blaming the quarterback for every issue in a football game, blaming the pres. we all want similar things, idk why we’re struggling so hard to solve the problem"
A5sfLIznSjI,"Short answer no, long answer is they can implant plans and or policies that can both hurt or help the economy. One example of this is regulating gas prices although not often a president has the ability to release oil reserves making the supply go up and when supply goes up prices go down"
A5sfLIznSjI,"People think the president affects the economy, which means the president affects the economy. Thats how the economy works. It only works if people trust that their money is of value, and if they think the president has a big hand in it then it is therefore true."
A5sfLIznSjI,"I don't know, I feel like you're saying the President doesn't control the economy then list out all the way they influence it in fairly significant ways. And even if it's not significant on a macro level, there are very much significant micro economic impact made on a legislative level. Unless everyone else is literally thinking of a big lever that says ""economy,"" the idea that presidents don't have outsized influence, or ""control,"" is an exaggeration."
A5sfLIznSjI,The Republican Party thrives off of misinforming their voters/supporters
A5sfLIznSjI,"The only purpose the US President  is to serve as for the government, a face to put the blame on. The president only has power if the government wants them to, usually when that president has the government’s best interest in mind. The people aren’t the government"
A5sfLIznSjI,"Trump, Biden, and Kamala failed to mention at the beginning that the covid pandemic messed up inflation and jobs."
A5sfLIznSjI,"The only purpose the US President  is to serve as for the government, a face to put the blame on. The president only has power if the government wants them to, usually when that president has the government’s best interest in mind. The people aren’t the government"
A5sfLIznSjI,Did you hear who won the latest Nobel Prize for Economics?? They just proved that governments do steer the economies. No free pass for Dems!!
A5sfLIznSjI,Welcome to Idiocracy 😂
A5sfLIznSjI,"I would agree for the most part with the exception of one point. Donald Trump can be blamed for the global pandemic making its way to America because he is the one who allowed it to come in by claiming it was a hoax. I think people forget, the country had the opportunity to lock itself down at one point before we had any cases of COVID-19, but instead chose not to because he was pretending that it wasn’t real. Imagine how different things would’ve been if he took it serious before he himself got it."
A5sfLIznSjI,This is just a problem for the shadow government 🤦‍♂️

A5sfLIznSjI,no
A5sfLIznSjI,"Here after Trump won, clearing  Americans still don't know this. For now, I'm just going to predict a presidency by the strengths of our economy and which party was around when the economy slipped."
A5sfLIznSjI,Very informative and useful information
A5sfLIznSjI,Unpopular opinion: education is more important than the economy
A5sfLIznSjI,"Unfortunately the people who think this is the case dont listen to facts and aren't interested in gaining an understanding of the world. ""When you don't know how anything works, everything seems like a conspiracy"""
A5sfLIznSjI,"And who caused the late response to control the widespread of covid 19? Dumty, thats who"
A5sfLIznSjI,"That joke you made at 9:48 was quite disrespectful to those women, and we’re not gonna take it anymore"
A5sfLIznSjI,Hi
A5sfLIznSjI,"Yes, Biden and Harris ruined our economy.  America needs Trump"
A5sfLIznSjI,"Yes, Trump didn't cause the COVID recession, but he made it a lot worse by mishandling it.

He failed to create a proper vaccine distribution network in time. In fact he created/popularized a large part of the vaccine misinformation we saw (see ivermectin scandal).

Not to mention his general animosity towards the medical community including his chief medical advisor.

Also that he used extorted countries and even American cities that he didn't like by threatening to withhold the vaccine.

I think it's perfectly reasonable to blame him for the economy under COVID. Most countries dealt with the virus much better than he did.

No, presidents don't directly control the economy, but their actions have massive effects on it. And they can be blamed for those actions given a causal link is provided."
A5sfLIznSjI,"How does price gouging work in a large, competitive ecmonomy? Seems like a boogeyman scare"
A5sfLIznSjI,"Clinton’s Economy was the best economy I have ever experienced.

Actually Obama started a system where new jobs are created in the government as needed to offset unemployment deficits. Nobody has changed that system or tampered with it because it benefits both parties.

A pandemic may be the cause for a recession but not entirely because Trump had no plans for how to protect nor rid people of the virus… unless you just count drinking Clorox Bleach. Companies reacted by massive layoffs.

Inflation no, why because the US Federal Reserve told Trump and Biden they needed a budget because inflation was to increase making it more expensive to print money. Congress followed Trump when Trump said I may not get another term next term. Congress instead of creating a budget told America that democrats didn’t need them to make a budget.

Tariffs Yes, imposing tariffs drives up prices for imports and increases smuggling goods into a country… much like china does with platforms like Alibaba, Temu, Amazon, and Walmart.

Unfortunately yes Corporations influence the economy. FinTech is soon to merge Crypto with AI as an alternative financial system for autonomous AI intelligence. The plan is to see how far they can go managing this system and what they can accomplish or learn from AI to better the US economy or if they can trust AI with some features.

I don’t believe this because it would intel that AI platforms will need to buy something. Beyond energy to charge, I doubt that. Speculation is also universal income will not pass or be enough so you would lend your AI companion to companies to work on your behalf. I doubt this because companies would just buy one outright.

Anyway you do with the information that you want, I going back to painting with Bob Ross."

A5sfLIznSjI,I would love a video on how price gouging influences perceptions and if citizens take notice.
A5sfLIznSjI,All money is created out of thin air. 😏
A5sfLIznSjI,"If the president had nothing to do with the economy or do not control it an ANY WAY, why is it expected they have an economic plan when campaigning? clearly their actions have an effect."
A5sfLIznSjI,Poor policies absolutely control the economy. That’s why we are in the mess we are in.
A5sfLIznSjI,"Their foreign polices, tax policies, and other legal changes effect the economy. So the answer is very obviously yes. Just kinda indirectly"
A5sfLIznSjI,This is the dumbest claim ever. Saying that an embargo or a sanction is not effecting our economy here... This is just insanely manipulative here with no facts to the case.
A5sfLIznSjI,"We are running out of resources. Every single troglodyte will blame it on superficial lies when in reality, it’s a simple fucking supply and demand problem."
A5sfLIznSjI,7:30
A5sfLIznSjI,I'm sure firing the pandemic response team right before COVID didn't help matters.
A5sfLIznSjI,"Eggs and gas have to be close to an all time inflation adjusted low. But since they are less discretionary items, and many people buy them weekly, that's where people will tend to complain."
A5sfLIznSjI,"In a robust system like that of the US, this is true. It was not Trump’s fault that we had a pandemic the same way it wasn’t Biden’s fault that Russia invaded Ukraine."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Yet they do have a lot of control over the economy, one of Bidens first orders he signed into law shit down the pipeline which gave most of the US gas"
A5sfLIznSjI,I almost clocked out of the vid cause I read mr. Beast
A5sfLIznSjI,This is very factual and very nice
A5sfLIznSjI,"You fail to mention the large sphere of influence Biden and other key democratic politicians have including multi billionaires like Bill Gates, George Soros, and the governor of the Fed that was nominated by Obama. 

The people that pushed the most for closing everything down and disrupting the economy were mostly democratic politicians while Trump tried his best to keep everything the same. Hence what you said earlier, the president can't control everything. In my opinion we cant blame Biden for every part of the economy but we can blame his supporters and inadvertently, Biden himself.....and of course this means Kamala too"
A5sfLIznSjI,"8:30 sir gas prices have gone down, yes. But they are still double than 4 years ago"
A5sfLIznSjI,5:30 I mean trump did create jobs via leveraging tariffs to get foreign based companies to build factories here. And it worked. Wouldnt that mean Trump created jobs? Yes I'm sure there's a similar Biden example but this is the example that comes to mind
A5sfLIznSjI,"13:53 while they brought gas prices up momentarily, they’re now back down to where they were beforehand and as a benefit, we’re no longer supporting Russia."
A5sfLIznSjI,BLUF: NO
A5sfLIznSjI,Covid!!
A5sfLIznSjI,"4:12 i may just be parroting lefty talking points here, but there were signs the economy was slowing down due to the trump admin's policies _before_ covid hit the US, and some official recession indicator or other came out shortly before the lockdowns began.  covid gave trump cover for fumbling the economy obama left him."
A5sfLIznSjI,Americans are so shocked by a democracy not acting like a dictatorship
A5sfLIznSjI,"Thanks for teaching us what we deserve to have been taught in school. You’re the best, and I hope this video reaches millions!"
A5sfLIznSjI,"Massive government spending can create inflation, and Covid spending by both Biden and Trump contributed to the recent bout of inflation."
A5sfLIznSjI,This like when people speak about Real estate they just spam interest rates and Rich dad and poor dad 🙄
A5sfLIznSjI,"There is the debate that government spending projects like the New Deal helped pull the economy out of the Great Depression. Yes, WWII finally managed to fully correct the depression, but the New Deal had a significant impact until the money ran dry. Hoover did nothing telling citizens to rely on American values to overcome the depression prior to FDR. I am not saying this lesson isn't mostly true. It took Congress to make the New Deal happen, but there was a drastic difference between how those two presidents handled the depression with wildly different results."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Democrats don’t do anything to the economy, Republicans make it worse"
A5sfLIznSjI,I love this video thank you for making this video.
A5sfLIznSjI,i love that u dont give a partisan vieuw on this stuff; u try to not show ur own political vieuws in this stuff (unless when aplicable)
A5sfLIznSjI,Oh yeah the President definitely doesn't affect the economy🙄🙄🤣🤣
A5sfLIznSjI,The economy is world wide!!
A5sfLIznSjI,more low test propaganda from a sheep
A5sfLIznSjI,They hire the folks who control the economy.
A5sfLIznSjI,"Don't tell MAGA that the President doesn't control prices,their brain will explode."

A5sfLIznSjI,BIDEN HARRIS RUINED OUR ECONOMY IN 4 YEARS BY USING BIDENECONOMIÇS ???     I GUESS PRESIDENTS DO CONTROL THE ECONOMY ...
A5sfLIznSjI,Mr. Beat quite possibly the best channel on YouTube. Dare I say the world.
A5sfLIznSjI,"This is such a sophomoric take. The president is essentially just a dictator, pretending like he isn't is just wishful thinking. Executive orders give the president full and total control over the country, and the only way they can get overturned is if the supreme court rules them as unconstitutional. YES, the president controls the economy, or at least he is able to."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Control it? No. Influence it? Yes, absolutely."
A5sfLIznSjI,"I find that they very little power to make go well or poor. But with Congress's help, they can really screw it up. Even with Congress's help, they have very little power to make it go well."
A5sfLIznSjI,"""PRESIDENTS DON'T HAVE MUCH CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY. GET OVER IT."" That is a lie, a president has as much control over the economy as they wish to exercise. 

For example, on August 15, 1971, President Nixon issued Executive Order 11615. This Executive Order locked prices, rents, wages, and salaries. When a president locks down prices, businesses can change, and the wages they pay affect the economy. When a president makes it illegal to raise rents, the economy is affected. 

The prices of goods and services, and wages and salaries have an effect on the economy. A president can lock down the prices charged, rents, wages, and salaries if they want to. These items have an effect on the economy.

If the president can control prices, rents, wages, and salaries via Executive Order the president has a profound effect on the economy hint the president has that power, the president has as much affect over the economy as they wish to exercise."
A5sfLIznSjI,The President has a lot of control over spending... https://youtu.be/F94jGTWNWsA?si=z9xNCZDL4PCd1OGt
A5sfLIznSjI,"Something I always wondered about is any policy changes that get made, how long does it take to see results? So could you have one administration make changes but the effects don't become apparent until the next administration? So does it even make sense to point to who did what during elections."
A5sfLIznSjI,"I respectfully disagree with your hypothesis. While it's true Trump didn't cause the pandemic, he and his administration most definitely could have done a much better job on information and supply dispersal, working in tandem with medical experts (a crackpot that tells people to inject Clorox in their bodies has no business running the country), and a whole host of other issues that offered opportunities for a better situation. He didn't 'start the fire', but he sure as heck could have lessened the burn."
A5sfLIznSjI,So the USA does not have a Command Economy. Who would have thought.
A5sfLIznSjI,LET HIM COOK
A5sfLIznSjI,"Economy/inflation is based on supply and demand. Banks buy up houses and inflate the prices by lowering the supply of availability to a massive population. The bigger the population gets, the more everything will cost because resources become limited. Corporations fake low supply also to gain profits. The banks & corps are running around, causing havoc. Bernie has been pointing it out for decades!!!"
A5sfLIznSjI,Interestingly all economies do much better under a democrat than republican 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
A5sfLIznSjI,"I would gather that 70% of Americans know nothing about anything, let alone how the economy or our Government works."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Everyone needs to see this, but few will and fewer will accept it."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Yes. They have power over energy policy. They don't spend the money but they can push for tax and spend policy, causing the printing of money. Both cause inflation."
A5sfLIznSjI,"“It’s more fun to be wrong. My ego’s too big anyway.”

A5sfLIznSjI,Finally someone gets it.
A5sfLIznSjI,"Another great video, Mr. Beat. We have a lot of issues to work on as a country. Hopefully, decency and reason prevail. Our country is so much stronger when we're working together to make things better than when we're fighting against each other to tear things apart."
A5sfLIznSjI,I disagree.
A5sfLIznSjI,Trump did dismantle the pandemic response team that Obama had set up. That mattered at least a little bit.
A5sfLIznSjI,@mrbeat another very substantial cause of inflation during that time Period is greedflation.  In the past 12 to 18 months there’s been significant discovery of numerous companies and Industries price gouging customers which  accounts for 40- 50% of the price inflation.
A5sfLIznSjI,"This is why I love this channel. You honestly educate those who are curious to understand HOW our government works and the economic system within it. Unfortunately, the general voting population don't know this, or willfully ignore the information or are purely based on trolling. But my betting money is on willfull ignorance. 

Nevertheless, thank you!!"
A5sfLIznSjI,"Just remember, trumps elected SEC Jerome powell has been running the economy show. Take that as you will."
A5sfLIznSjI,"It is a little weird that new presidents often keep appointing the FED chairman from the previous administration even when the previous administration is from a different party.

I'm not a conspiracy-minded person. I think most people mostly have good intentions. The minor bad intentions are present in all people by a similar amount, not just in ""the elites""
That being said, it is a little weird that new presidents often keep appointing the FED chairman from the previous administration even when the previous administration is from a different party.
Monetary policies are crucial and very influential for the economy, yet presidents who promise economic changes almost never changes FED chairman at least in their first adiministration. This is weird... and can spark conspiracy. There are a few possibilities that I can think of (ranked by decreasing likelihood):
1. The presidents want continuity for the strategy of FED, while valuing economic changes less... so they are soft-lying when they pretend to want significant economic changes, because they know deep down that FED is already operating at a near optical level where drastic change will most likely hurt than help. However, the general public is not intelligent enough to recognize and accept this, so politicians have to soft-lying about the degree of changes they will make.
2. Most of the presidents are strongly influenced by money interests, and they mostly just appoint whoever that allow them to get the most campaign finance money.
3. The president want competence, and really value an apolitical FED... which I think is less likely because if they genuinely want economic changes, they shouldn't value the apoliticalnesss much."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Usually, no. But when you single handedly start a completely bone-headed trade war with China, kicking off record inflation numbers, taking away markets for the farm belt, then epically mishandle a once-in-a-century pandemic, needlessly killing off half a million people, delaying reopening the economy by spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories about masks and vaccines and the WHO and CDC for your own stupidity and vanity, worsen relations with all of your country's traditional allies making markets around the world more uncertain, embolden Vladimir Putin to start a war in Europe leading to worldwide energy shortages and exacerbating the supply chain issues caused in large part by your epic mishandling of the previously mentioned pandemic, pass massive tax cuts for billionaires who don't need it not just raising but exploding the national deficit during peacetime and an economic boom period something that has never been done before in history, et cetera....   that *maybe* just *maybe* might negatively impact the economy....

... and then in your 2nd hypothetical term if you slap a 20% tariff on everything unilaterally across the board, and a 100% tariff on imported automobiles, and put Elon Musk in charge of everything he wants, and make RFK Jr your healthcare czar, and start deporting 20 million + laborers who you think of as illegal regardless of their actual legal status, and start revoking licenses from businesses not friendly to the regime, and confiscate all university campuses to be sold off to big business, and replace every competent and qualified bureaucraft and expert and official in the entire US government, from the department of agriculture, to commerce, to the interior, to energy, to the FCC, etc... with cronies and loyal political hacks....   then....  *maybe*... just going to go out on a limb here... that *might* be bad for the economy, too...   I mean....  I'm not one of the dozens of multiple Nobel-prize winning economists who have said that Trump's proposals would be an absolute disaster for the economy... nor am I the esteemed and revered Mr. Beat the high school (university?) history teacher turned YouTube personality... so what the fuck do I know? But... seems like it might have an impact... 

Dismantling NATO and allowing Putin to roll over Ukraine and start another war with Poland or something might be bad, too... but... yeah... sure it's nothing to worry about. Heaven forbid we get too political or partisan here."
A5sfLIznSjI,Capitalism really has rotted out brains
A5sfLIznSjI,"My company has been growing and adding jobs for a couple years now. But obviously its all thanks to Trump and Biden, not any of the things we have done"
A5sfLIznSjI,No but their policies can greatly affect it.
A5sfLIznSjI,They don't control the economy but they ask Congress to turn their tax policies into law. Right now middle class families need tax cuts more than ever.
A5sfLIznSjI,The double gasp at 5:20☠️☠️😭
A5sfLIznSjI,"In summer 2022 Biden opened up oil drilling on federal land and lowered the strategic oil reserve levels. The Trumpers still blamed him despite the europeans cutting of oil imports from Russia. I peeled off the ""Biden did that"" stickers from gas pumps."
A5sfLIznSjI,"YES!! I get so exhausted explaining this to people. And though annoyingly quirky, this video nails it."
A5sfLIznSjI,It frustrates me to no end that elections in America are basically decided by single issue voters on the basis of whether times were good when the last guy was in office.
A5sfLIznSjI,"well republicans are too blame because the house of representatives has been republican majority for 4 years and they haven't passed a single significant bill that was at high importance.
Except for the ones they literally had to pass like the deficit.
Not 1 Major bill has been passed in the house that is Republican majority for 4 years."
A5sfLIznSjI,A better more common sense question would be “do they *Influence* the economy?” which is a big fat yes.
A5sfLIznSjI,I HOPE THIS VIDEO GOES VIRAL it is such a common myth that the president controls the economy fully and people need to know the truth
A5sfLIznSjI,I'm not an economist but I always told that to my kids the president doesn't control the economy and doesn't control the housing prices
A5sfLIznSjI,"President's can control the economy. 
The idea of the free market is that they should not. 
Do you want someone in office who wants to control how your allowed to make money?"
A5sfLIznSjI,Biden did when he shut down the oil pipelines. The price of fuel went up and so did all products that had to be transported. Thanks Joe.
A5sfLIznSjI,This is a good one Matt. Keep ‘em coming.
A5sfLIznSjI,"The answer to this question is as follows:

If the political party you cheer for holds the executive branch then the president does not control the economy when the economy is doing poorly. If the economy is doing well then the president does control the economy.

If the opposition party to the political party you cheer for holds the executive branch then the president absolutely controls the economy if the economy is doing bad, Unless the economy is doing well then the president does not have anything to do with the economy.

If the Economy is doing well and the opposition to the party you cheer for holds the executive branch but your party held it prior then the good economy is the delayed  result of the favorable policies put in place by the previous administration.

If the Economy is doing poorly and  the party you cheer for holds the executive branch but the opposition party held it prior then the  bad economy was inherited and we just need to wait for the current policies to take effect.

Hope this helps"
A5sfLIznSjI,"Presidents create environments that economies can thrive in, or not( see current administration)."
A5sfLIznSjI,"I’m very grateful the Presidency doesn’t have full economic control, it’s already the most powerful responsibility in the world.

I think George Washington would be very disappointed at how powerful the presidency has become, hence why he left after two terms & discouraged political parties."
A5sfLIznSjI,"But right-wingers think c19 was created by Democrats, partially to destroy the economy, in order to prevent Trump from getting reelected. Their proof? Facebook memes."
A5sfLIznSjI,Sometimes I feel like the President is just a figure head that congress uses as a scapegoat for people to blame the problems on that they actually created
A5sfLIznSjI,I’m convinced that a little while ago congress met in secret to unanimously agree to blame the president for every issue in the country so they could make terrible decisions and not worry about job security lol
A5sfLIznSjI,"Yeah, this is something i learned in freshman year of college in econ 101. People judge presidential success based on the state of the economy, but the irony is that the president has very minimal control over the economy (only small control over 1 small part of the GDP calculation). Not to say that a president can't have any impact (like pushing for government spending increase during recession ala keynes), but its impact is vastly overstated."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Representative Charles A. Lindbergh Sr. predicted that the Federal Reserve Act would establish “the most gigantic trust on earth,” and that the Fed would become an economic dictator or, as he put it, an “invisible government by the money power.”"
A5sfLIznSjI,"They might not control the economy, but I tell you what. Pretty much global tariffs on foreign goods won't help the economy in any way. Sure, it may help a niche of domestic producers, but more are hurt by it than helped."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Fake news. Mr. Beat is completely wrong about everything, the egotistical jerk."
A5sfLIznSjI,This shows how politically illiterate i am about some things 😂😂 There's a lot to learn and to be re learned.
A5sfLIznSjI,"Well don't forget Trump did demand the Suadis reduce oil production in 2020 which they happily did as it drove oil costs up. So then Biden was blamed for Trump's actions in interfering with the market, in which the Suadis are just now talking about vamping production up again to get their market share back."
A5sfLIznSjI,When you’re  energy independent prices go down because production costs go down!  . Simple economics . The president can directly affect that by executive order like trump did. He proved it is possible to drop prices fast with the right initiatives.

A5sfLIznSjI,Talk about mr.beaat!!
A5sfLIznSjI,We can help the economy by creating businesses that people can afford and housing.
A5sfLIznSjI,"3:50 ""Not that much"", are you sure about that?
.
Let's say they increase the tax over businnesses.
Aren't people going to be laid down? 
Aren't products going to become more expensive?
.
Not that much, you said."
A5sfLIznSjI,Hey Mr. beat I’m so glad you’re talking about this because I say this to people all the time is that the president really doesn’t control the economy as much as  The legislative branch does because they’re the ones that write the laws and rules and policies that actually control things in the economy. A president can suggest things like hey let’s raise taxes or lower taxes or or let’s regulate certain industries or deregulate certain industries but it’s the legislative branch that makes it happen!! so that being said if you have a say Republicans that control one part of the legislative branch and they don’t want the president to be successful or accomplish anything! So thanks for the video
A5sfLIznSjI,"Tell us about tariffs. Tell how it affects the economy and us the consumer. Tell that it doesn't really affect the foreign country. The price stays the same, like Trump's washing machines. Even though we started making them, they stayed expensive. He bosts jobs he created (1800) yep thats all, so the foreign country still made and sold machines so did we and they cost the same. Tariffs also are hard to release. Some set in the 60s are still there today. I'm saying they hurt more than helping the economy in so many ways."
A5sfLIznSjI,"I've always known this, I've even been called, a liar, nuts, crazy, retarded, and don't know what I'm talking about. This is why i always ask why are they running on this. It's called snowballing."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Mr. Beat thinking, we wouldn't notice the absolute bop of The William Howard Taft Song instrumental at the beginning."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Correct, usually, but Trump is a special case. He is going to run up the cost of goods with his tariffs. And more."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Mr. Beat, Covid bioterrorist-Criminal Leaders; Federation of American Citizens Scientists and their Associates Worldwide should be tracked and be brought to JUSTICE. Trump and his GOP Allies claimed that FBI Agency searching his Mar-a-Lago Home was Politically weaponized by President Biden, the DOJ and the Democrats, that was a lie. FBIs  searching Trump's Home were searching for EVIDENCE in COVID pandemic bioterrorism Conspiracy. Trump's knowledge in COVID pandemic bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2020; should be exposed. COVID bioterrorist -Conspirators; Federation of American Citizens Scientists and their Associates; horrendous terrorist and bioterrorist Criminal activities in the shadows in US and in Worldwide Countries in the past 22 years should not be covered up coz their Leadership are Special Whites. COVID pandemic bioterrorism a US National Security issue and International Security issue; is MUCH WORSE THAN New York 9/11 terrorism, MUCH WORSE THAN Hamas terrorism in Israel on October 7th and Covid pandemic bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2020 is MUCH MUCH WORSE THAN Victim Trump's 1st, 2nd and 3rd assassination attempts. Covid pandemic Victims' Case is related to the Classified Documents Case should not be dismissed. The SCOTUS ruled that Trump has some immunity not total immunity. Covid bioterrorism pandemic the WORST bioterrorist-Crime in Human History since the beginning of the World; needs to be investigated. Judge Cannon, a Trump supporter, should not have dismissed the Classified Documents Case. Discovery evidences related to Trump and his Aides COVID briefings at the White House in November 2019 at night time; (Guests Meeting logs, White House Gates camera videos, emails and phone contacts etc), if THOSE INVESTIGATIONS LEADS-ITEMS are missing, there was a cover-up in COVID pandemic bioterrorism Conspiracy.Trump should have deleted, shredded or trashed away THOSE INVESTIGATIONS LEADS-ITEMS before he left the White House in early 2020, THOSE INVESTIGATIONS LEADS-ITEMS should not be ignored. Covid bioterrorism pandemic have wrongfully killed millions of People in the US and in Worldwide Countries. Covid bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2020 was intentionally masterminded in the shadows by Federation of American-Citizens Scientists (White Jewish Leadership, Republicans, Independents; Edward Snowden Affiliates) and their Associates Worldwide; Spies who Bush Administration awarded spy-Contracts and millions of dollars in 2002 to 2007. Wuhan bio-Lab leakage was not the origin of Covid. Trump and his GOP Allies lied on China as the source of Covid virus, China is a Victim like all other Countries Worldwide which have been affected with Covid pandemic. According to Peter Navarro's comments in KABC News two weeks after Wuhan Covid outbreak in 2020, he said ""we had Coronavirus briefing at the White House in November 2019, we were scared to go to sleep at night after the briefing"". That means Peter Navarro, Trump and others who attended Covid Briefing at the White House in November 2019 possibly at night time; before Wuhan Covid outbreak in 2020, they should have knowledge in Covid bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2020 and the true source of Covid virus but they covered up.
         The same bioterrorist-Criminals; Federation of American Scientists and their Associates (Chase Security Company Owners; Republicans) masterminded in the shadows Global Mexico H1N1 bioterrorism Conspiracy in 2009, they used Homeland Security Clearances in travelling to Cancun Mexico; that way the Border Authorities couldn't inspect their carry-on bags or luggages. Let Authorities or the Lower Courts as the SCOTUS explained; investigate in details so that JUSTICE IS SERVED."
A5sfLIznSjI,"I don't know if they're currently doing this or not, but I hope the Treasury Department goes after the people (typically wealthy Americans) who owe taxes. They need to pay their fair share."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Another day, another awesome Mr. Beat video. I think  another reason why people blame the president for when the economy is bad is because it is easier to blame one person then blaming  things such as natural disasters that you have no control over."
A5sfLIznSjI,8:20 ugh this guy is such a grift
A5sfLIznSjI,It also frustrates me to no end that people are under the impression that we *still* have runaway inflation despite our inflation rate currently residing at a rather healthy 2.4%.
A5sfLIznSjI,"So one is a lobbyists magnet and the other wants to defund the government so no one can complain when they don't have the money to fix things when it needs fixing, I swear I've heard this before oh wait it's my country, what an option you guys have to decide on, if it was me i'd vote for the 3rd or 4th option."
A5sfLIznSjI,I like that Mr beat is fair and presents us with facts
A5sfLIznSjI,"This is what liberals do when the economy is bad under a Democrat President. They strawman the argument, saying ""Of course the President doesn't CONTROL the economy."" And then they offer examples of how it's actually the legislature that controls the economy, but no one is even claiming ""control."" Liberals conveniently ignore the secondary and tertiary factors which affect the economy (such as diplomacy, a presidential authority) and then excuse a President's failures in regards to those factors."
A5sfLIznSjI,Poor handling by the president created the problem in the US
A5sfLIznSjI,2388th
A5sfLIznSjI,No of course lol it’s a reason you got paid 1 in 1950 and you get paid 20 now because as time progresses things get higher
A5sfLIznSjI,"No, but MAGGOTS think so.

If the cult believes it, then you know it's a lie."
A5sfLIznSjI,"Also, I swear the tax plan in the US currently is from Trump? His taxes as part of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” are due to expire in 2025. So those complaining about taxes should blame Trump but they’d probably spin it if you told them anyway."
A5sfLIznSjI,"I would never say a president controls an economy, I would say he/she can influence an economy and the amount of the influence is dependent on that particular president and his or her cabinet via regulatory powers. For example, when Trump ran in 2016 part of his platform was lower taxes. Now he didn’t necessarily create the bill, but he did influence Congress based on his ideas that draw the legislation that he later signed into law. Biden via regulatory powers decide to tighten up carbon admission from vehicles due at a certain date. Failure to reach those standards car companies will be fined."
A5sfLIznSjI,"The style certainly fits the more popular target audience, but not the memes"
A5sfLIznSjI,The Kenneth Copeland “covid 19 blow” gets me every time 😆!
A5sfLIznSjI,Trump's purposesed across the board 20% tariffs on every single import will absolutely have a negative effect on the economy.
A5sfLIznSjI,Enforcing anti trust laws should help the economy.
A5sfLIznSjI,Disappointed you did not mention the fact that most recessions were under Democrat-controlled Congresses
A5sfLIznSjI,"Thank you for this great video. I kept saying that the Cares Act, the  American Rescue Act, and tariffs caused inflation. I guess I was right."
A5sfLIznSjI,"The government has a hand at the wheel, but the problem is, it’s called supply and demand when you have so much of a good thing you can sell out the lower price when you have shortages everything must go up to pay for the cost but the Democrats also gave us a big surprise, because always thought was Business being closed down people weren’t working and the economy was going south in the COVID-19 but there again some people made a few bucks out of the deal with the hurricanes in the states they’re having no electricity and water as of yet but there again that’s called price gouging there again the Democrats have been asleep at the wheel. They don’t care because somebody’s driving the economy and stupidity has been running the White House for the past four years needs to common sense policies that used to work and still work back the job you had to remember folks Democrats are greedy, and everything is about them or the Republican Party tries to restore the country and gives everybody an equal chance at everything."
A5sfLIznSjI,So 108 unelected individuals have control of one of the most powerful institutions in the world?
A5sfLIznSjI,"Harris isn’t related to anyone, she will loose."
A5sfLIznSjI,No matter what political party you claim to be a part of you can't deny the fact that the president is not a commercial God power.
A5sfLIznSjI,no they just enact policies that control their microeconomics
A5sfLIznSjI,"I look at it like this, COULD they influence the economy sure. But it’s just that an influence; there is no way a president could constitutionally have big swings. Combined with the fact that what small change the president influences won’t actually become seen by the general public until 3-5 years AFTER it gets implemented"
A5sfLIznSjI,4:18 Why would you jumpscare us with that devilish man
A5sfLIznSjI,"While true that Trump didn’t cause Covid, he did take responsive actions. And those actions contributed to the jobs decline and recession. He punted the shutdown duration to the states. Very in-dictator like act. Was weak and terrible for the economy."
A5sfLIznSjI,Why not say that presidents have no impact or control of world affairs. Nope none!! So I suppose we’re just wasting time and money electing one!! Right??
A5sfLIznSjI,All my Econ major friends that I graduated in the spring with are in disbelief of the stupidity of some people
A5sfLIznSjI,"THIS SHIT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN REPEATING AD NAUSEUM SINCE CONSERVATIVES COINED ""BIDENFLATION""!  It was a complex solution to a complex problem.  The COVID pandemic tied in with high demand for goods.  That in conjunction with supply shortages caused prices to go up.  Price gouging by big corporations drove, and will continue to drive, inflation up significantly.  This boycott of Russian oil and other services was Biden's decision, which didn't help with inflation, neither did refusing to drill for oil on public land.  However, the free market ultimately drove up inflation, which ALL OF IT WAS BEYOND BIDEN'S CONTROL!  Bush's pro-oil policies pushed gas prices down to their lowest point during his first term.  Conservatives wanna blame Biden for inflation, but wanna give Trump all the credit when prices go down.  Little sus, almost as if they actually believe the myth that the President has direct control of the free market, supply and demand, and Corporate America's price gouging, which all control the price of goods and services.  This video sums it all up perfectly, and the thumbnail gives the short, simple answer:  NO!"
A5sfLIznSjI,"False.
It’s a myth
Though the stats show dem prez = more jobs from 1949-2012

The prez does not have enough influence over economy 

https://youtu.be/A5sfLIznSjI?si=-W9S3rHM4_dtM15Y

That’s what Mr beat says at least.

Do not choose your prez for concerns about economy. Talk to congress about that.

Prez for things like abortion rightsv"

onEdA8OV9po,"No, the nature of the US system of government inherently is set up to make a true authoritarian government hard to implement. Our constitution also provides a buffer to the reactionary politics that other western democracies suffer from, which leads to stability and predictability for investors. The US is also a place where workers and employers have many choices where they want to live and operate, the US is made up of hundreds of smaller economies that work together to make the national economy robust. Also, we tend to expect the government to do what we need and want it to do, rather than the other way around, meaning government is expected to react to society rather than attempt to shape society artificially."
onEdA8OV9po,This is why leftism is garbage
onEdA8OV9po,Trump* fascim
onEdA8OV9po,i would love for you to add bits like watch video x from context matters when there is a political tone to something similar to how you do with history.
onEdA8OV9po,"LOL, economics is just justifications for politicians. It is NOT science!"
onEdA8OV9po,CM kinda sucks atb tbh
onEdA8OV9po,Economics is inherently political....
onEdA8OV9po,Can't wait to dig in on the new channel. Already subscribed! Love your approach to this content.
onEdA8OV9po,this guy talks weird
onEdA8OV9po,"Please keep up your great work. Educating our society in economics without political spin is essential for our democracy.
Thank you"
onEdA8OV9po,"This video talks about the relationship between economics and politics, and how important it is to understand both to make sense of the world around us. The speaker, who runs the channel Economics Explained, is launching a new channel called Context Matters that will focus on geopolitics.

The video argues that economics and politics are inextricably linked. Bad economic policies can lead to political instability, and political instability can make it difficult to implement good economic policies. For example, the video mentions that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was a bad economic decision driven by political motivations.

The video also points out that the United States has been able to maintain economic stability because of its robust democracy. However, the speaker warns that the US is not immune to the challenges that many other countries are facing, and that it is important to understand the factors that have contributed to its success in order to avoid making mistakes in the future.

One of the things that the new Context Matters channel will do is provide insights into geopolitical rivalries. The video mentions North Korea as an example of a country that has been a thorn in the side of the global economy for many years. The speaker says that the new channel will explain why North Korea has been able to avoid being dealt with by the much more significant powers in the region.

Overall, the video is a call for people to pay more attention to both economics and politics. By understanding how these two forces interact, we can better understand the world around us and make better decisions about the future.

Here are some specific points from the video that I found interesting:

* The video makes the case that economic theories should be developed without political bias. This is important because biased theories can lead to bad economic policies.
* The video points out that the United States has many economic advantages, but that these advantages are not guaranteed to last forever. The US needs to continue to make wise decisions in order to maintain its economic stability.
* The video highlights the importance of understanding geopolitical rivalries. These rivalries can have a significant impact on the global economy.

I hope this summary is helpful!"
onEdA8OV9po,Watched Context Matters. Their video about an Authoritarian US was disappointing. They just plucked some news from left leaning sources and took them at face value. Better off watching America Uncovered if you want US politics.
onEdA8OV9po,There is no such thing as economics separate from politics. Its why the study of political economy is more accurate to real life than economics
onEdA8OV9po,So glad to have you as a dependable resource.
onEdA8OV9po,"Didnt even watch a context matters video yet and i already subscirbed, thats how much i trust you bro"
onEdA8OV9po,Economics by itself is political.
onEdA8OV9po,"your latest videos, especially in regards to china, its super biased and honestly...quite hateful spreading... i hope you get this and start becoming a bit more objective. the wold its huuge and not all countries have to be like yours."
onEdA8OV9po,Probably my new favorite YT channel.  Thx for the modern knowledge and thanks for everything!
onEdA8OV9po,Everything about this channel reeks of establishment but posing as something logical and benign. I'll be very interested to hear the propaganda out in the open rather than hidden among half truth economics.
onEdA8OV9po,Context matters... bit of a bias in there. Maybe want to think this one over.
onEdA8OV9po,"Checked out the new channel, and I'm very disappointed. Extremely biased within just a few videos."
onEdA8OV9po,the problem is just politics.
onEdA8OV9po,"Came here expecting a political + economical analysis of the situation, found a pure military one"
onEdA8OV9po,"2:05 Now we are talking, thumbs up"
onEdA8OV9po,"1:41 thats true, best economic policy is no economic policy"
onEdA8OV9po,Political economy?
onEdA8OV9po,6:08 easy the answer is the second amendment
onEdA8OV9po,"Saying politics and economics shouldn’t be mixed is one of the most ideological statements ever made.
Actually, it rose to prominence within the political discourse during the era of neoliberal ascendancy, basically to justify imposing austerity onto working people and painting it as supposed “common sense”. 
Disgraceful"
onEdA8OV9po,Lol America is a democracy.
onEdA8OV9po,"Ay, you stupid.

United States has spent more time interfering with other countries and it has spent doing anything else."
onEdA8OV9po,amazing guys big fan... count with a new follower in context matters.. (Y)
onEdA8OV9po,"Good to have people we trust providing context. Well done, team. 🏆"
onEdA8OV9po,Politics are more powerful than the economic Sientific way for now. I said for NOW.
onEdA8OV9po,"Speaking of politics and economics, can you do a video about Milton Friedman? And/or Thomas Sowell's basic economics?"
onEdA8OV9po,"I love this so much, thank you, truly, for all this valuable knowledge"
onEdA8OV9po,"No thanks, you need to vet rid of the the geopolitical ‘experts’."
onEdA8OV9po,No more epic economist?
onEdA8OV9po,"Americas recent growth is ‘immigration’ and military production, loans and spending."
onEdA8OV9po,"What a load of rubbish, your videos for a long time now have been choc full of political propaganda."
onEdA8OV9po,Oh yay another propaganda channel 🤢🤮
onEdA8OV9po,"Just watched all three videos on the new channel and… I’m hopeful they’ll get better?  I like EE as it feels honest.  Here’s how economic theory explains what happened/is happening. I don’t know how you can do the same with a channel dedicated to the politics of situations, but that’s what you seem to be trying to sell here… and that wasn’t what I got. 

To be clear, I agree with the videos for the most part so it’s not like I’m saying I don’t like it because I lean differently on the political spectrum. I just finished each video feeling like I’d watched a fear mongering video that YouTube is full of and I typically try to avoid and I was expecting something to step outside the politics and try to explain the politics in a detached way. 

Still love EE."
onEdA8OV9po,latest misinformation update just hit
onEdA8OV9po,"Please do a video on lithium and the geopolitics of the industry with Argentina's recent referendum announcement (will it lead to sanctions?) - the Chilean Lithium Triangle - concurrent import duties against China and the EU's green targets.... *Something doesn't add up*
😂"
onEdA8OV9po,Economics explained acting as if economics is somehow above ideology is simply too cringe to comprehend
onEdA8OV9po,"I just hope you will not be biased and you will judge with facts and look at things with a neutral understanding in your new channel, Context Matters. Many Western media outlets are biased and prejudiced against other nations when diving into Geopolitics. I hope your agenda is to provide understanding of these geopolitical matters and not to further divide your viewers by providing only a Western perspective on these issues, as many others have done. Geopolitics is very complicated and not black and white, but a whole spectrum of the politics of developing and developed nations and their fractions, blocks and foreign policies.

I hope your new channel will truly live up to its name!"
onEdA8OV9po,Loving that Economics Explained is teaming up with the legendary Michael Hiliard
onEdA8OV9po,"So, by experts, do you mean that just you hired ASPI staff?"
onEdA8OV9po,Now we'll truly see the extent of your bias
onEdA8OV9po,"I never thought that an entire video could be devoted to the promotion of another channel, yet still look as academic as all the other well-made videos of this channel"
onEdA8OV9po,so EE's first question to its experts will essentially be: Is the USA magic?
onEdA8OV9po,"the reason experts can get more money for their knowledge in America is because their economy treats the most basic things, like basic healthcare (that are readily available to most devoloped economies' citizens as standard) as if they are luxury goods"
onEdA8OV9po,do an economics explained analysis of the occupation of palestine and show us how unbiased and soooo totally impartial you are
onEdA8OV9po,You should just show footage of the actual UN instead of that horrible fake stock footage
onEdA8OV9po,"Go for the trifecta ... start a new channel on religions around the world, and their influence on economies.  Good luck with that."
onEdA8OV9po,Conventional wisdom on Keynesian economics provides a useful channel in which to opine au-contraire.  Conventional wisdom in liberal politics is just so pointless.
onEdA8OV9po,"Wow, if you don't do better on future releases on this new channel, you are likely to tarnish your popularity on your main channel!  How to Become the Dictator of the USA seems like a real OwnGoal"
onEdA8OV9po,You didn’t really answer the question
onEdA8OV9po,Is an officially unique economy a thing that could exist?  What’s the body that grants “official” status?
onEdA8OV9po,"Very funny)))) Of course the US is not an authocracy, but it's not a democracy either. The right word is an ligarchy, the rule of the few. You can read Giants: The Global Power Elite by Peter Phillips or any other book that describes the reality of power."
onEdA8OV9po,The US has basically rigged the game in their favour. And they have all the advantages of a big domestic market and plenty of land and resources that they took from others. Having the international reserve etc. with their debt they should collapse but the world is too dependent on the US economy to ever demand the debt to be repaid. Basically they are too big to fail.
onEdA8OV9po,Throwback to political economy
onEdA8OV9po,"I really appreciate that you are trying to be unbiased, and as someone who works in academia and economics, I completely see your point.

However, after frequently following your channel for years, I still sometimes feel the emotional bias in your analyses, most importantly when it come to China (the exception being the belt and road initiative which was well done) and of course and obviously, the Middle East (you really hate their economies but maybe make it less obvious).

And please don't use the occasional sad Sunak or sneering Xi because it undermines the reviewer's trust."
onEdA8OV9po,"I'm always happy for something new from a channel (and people, in general lol) who know what they're doing or trying to. But I don't like anything political so, I'll just wait and see."
onEdA8OV9po,Most robust democracy in world is a joke kept by private donations aka bribery in white gloves
onEdA8OV9po,USA and stability? Now those are the two entities that don't go together.
onEdA8OV9po,Too vague to be interesting.
onEdA8OV9po,"Lol why did the Classicals term the field as a Political Economy?

@EconomicsExplained did your Econ class have a course on history of economic thought? For people in the opposite side - Finance ... Did you have a course in history of money?"
onEdA8OV9po,Congrats. How will you ensure that your personal political biases don’t influence your content?
onEdA8OV9po,Anyone who claims that economics is not inherently political is either naive or lying.
onEdA8OV9po,Your takes are insane already. Extremely hard pass
onEdA8OV9po,I'm sure this will be as pluralistic and non-hegemonic as possible...
onEdA8OV9po,"""Check out my politics channel, that starts with... Trump as a dictator!""
Bro, get help for your Trump derangement syndrome."
onEdA8OV9po,Looking at the GDP graph at the start and I wonder how much of that increase is just from price increases from inflation rather than any actual productivity increases.
onEdA8OV9po,Stepping on reallifelore's toes a bit aren't we?

She's also an economist and tries to analyse and translate what is going on in China based on the financial statements."
onEdA8OV9po,"It will be interesting to see how you approach this.  Politics is one of the most divisive, most poorly understood topics in the modern world.  Its also why Keynesian economics is vastly more popular with politicians, than the Austrian school is.

onEdA8OV9po,Just seen the new YouTube channel. Super disappointed it’s extremely left leaning.
onEdA8OV9po,You are being very brave.  see a lot of very passionate comments in your future...
onEdA8OV9po,"No, please. Having a single channel is simplicity at its finest. I think the people who cares about economics are the same as those who do with politics. Talk politics all you want in this channel. We’ll watch."

onEdA8OV9po,"I keep getting the feeling when I read into what experts say or produce, is that in reality nobody knows anything and we're all just winging it.

Public policy is essentially one big game of chess, only the chess board is way bigger, and there are more pieces to move around."
onEdA8OV9po,New channel sucks. Clearly unresearched and biased to push a set of agendas supporting those in power.

onEdA8OV9po,Surprised you didn't explicitly mention that you're working with the folks at The Red Line. I started listening to them earlier this year and it is top notch. I'm excited for this collaboration!
onEdA8OV9po,"Men, who dominate positions of power in our institutions, cant think holistically and strategically only compartmentally"
onEdA8OV9po,Once again you have my attention.
onEdA8OV9po,"Ah, context. Whose context? What is their political bias? You will have much to prove about being unbiased in your analysis, and how close the connection between facts and conclusions will be."
onEdA8OV9po,Economics and politics are already mixed: we have liberal economists and conservative economists.  We don't have liberal physicists and conservative physicists.
onEdA8OV9po,"Just straight up telling lies at 5:30. The US ranks 36th and is described as a deficient democracy by democracy matrix, so not even in the top 20%. Just tripping and spilling your ideology all over the ground for everyone to see."

onEdA8OV9po,"Hey EE, you probably won't read this but I thought its worth a shot to help you out.

I am pretty concerned about this new channel not holding up to your high standards. These videos seem hacky, not useful-information-dense, and relatively uninsightful. Frankly, I would be careful staking your reputation against such videos unless you feel very confidently that I am wrong."

onEdA8OV9po,"Ethics and politics are not the same. I don't mean that in the stupid sense of all politicians are self serving and corrupt, but there are experts in ethics. Politics go horribly wrong if a politician proclaims himself to be the authority in that just as much as when they think they're experts in economics"
onEdA8OV9po,I graduated with a BS PolySci degree focusing on IR. Ive watched EE for years. Love it. I cant wait to see the new series. Congrats.
onEdA8OV9po,I wish you would do a review on South Africa and also explain how the banks played with our currency.
onEdA8OV9po,"Super cool! I've really enjoyed this channel, so looking forward to the politics side!"
onEdA8OV9po,"I wrote my senior thesis on this topic, focusing on how politicians turn to (often discredited) economic theories that have a confirmation bias alignment with the electorate. I used trickle-down economics (Reaganomics) as my case study. It demonstrably doesn't work, but it confirms the biases of conservative voters (taxes are evil; everyone 100% earns every single dollar of their income, and not a single dollar more or less than that; exploitation isn't possible; and neither are unjustifiably large salaries), so even 40-odd years on, it's still being advocated for."
onEdA8OV9po,"It's true. Your politics are probably like mine.

They're absolute trash and nobody likes you. I get it, bro."
onEdA8OV9po,"Before the early 20th century there was no economics, it was called political economy. The detachment of the term used by Marx, Adam Smith and others, into two separate disciplines is the fraud. Thinking of them separately always leads to unintended consequences."
onEdA8OV9po,Oh good another person on youtube smart about one thing then agreeing with the left on everything.
onEdA8OV9po,"America's system is so redundant and robust that even someone like Biden cannot really ""destroy"" our country. Checks and balances are a beautiful thing, it prevents an idiot in one location one ruining it for the rest of us.  That is also because America isn't really run on it's politicians, but is run by it's people. The PEOPLE of America have a culture of earning what they want, innovating new ways of getting what they want and are allowed the freedom by the government to get crafty with it. Places like China will never see innovative success such as America, because the only way to have the GDP America has, is to give your citizens the freedom to do so."
onEdA8OV9po,"Really liked the EE channel, but your new videos are clearly pushing a serious left wing agenda. It’s a shame really."
onEdA8OV9po,Economy is not only linked with politics. It is by itself inherently political. What is understood as the quality of life for example or GDP or growth as indicators of positive development are deeply ideological.
onEdA8OV9po,When you realize that not every question can be answered by yes or no but sometimes by the context then that is wisdom
onEdA8OV9po,It's actually the devastating consequences of mixing economics and humans.
onEdA8OV9po,I personally preferred the mix of Economics and Politics since it explains stuff way better!
onEdA8OV9po,"never mix economic and politics
Politics are usually personal opinion of the channel."
onEdA8OV9po,"This is Academia and politics, not economics and politics. Change the title."
onEdA8OV9po,"Now i understand why Context Matters was recommended to me by YouTube.

If the economics analysis and insights are comparable to the political insight I saw on the other channel, it puts into question the content here.

There are enough real concerns in the world without resorting to over-hyping situations. I strongly recommend keeping the analysis to the facts and history and avoid creating the clickbait content. I promise, global politics will keep things perfectly interesting on it's own."
onEdA8OV9po,"After going from this channel to your new one, I was expecting a more balanced and less opinion focused method of presenting the facts and information available.  I’ll still be watching your EE channel, but I am disappointed with the content of your other channel and think there are better unbiased sources out there that explore these concepts and difficult questions in a more nuanced and insightful way."
onEdA8OV9po,"If you think economics and politics aren't intimately connected, you shouldn't be running a channel called ""Economics Explained"" because you either don't understand economics or you're a neoliberal propagandist."
onEdA8OV9po,"I have to admit, I seen the Context Matters videos in my Subscriptions inbox and wondered where the flippity-doo-dah they came from, coz I don't remember subscribing!"
onEdA8OV9po,A noble intention but ultimately a futile endeavor failure is inevitable the current paradigm is if America bashing then successful video especially the self loathing America bashing and the casting countrymen as treasonous America bashing you can't separate the chocolate from the peanut butter anymore it is too late the political and economic is a quantum superposition and there is no moral victory on YouTube either you succeed or no one cares to listen at all regardless of accuracy or merit
onEdA8OV9po,Do a video on the genocide by israel
onEdA8OV9po,Having a thumbnail of Trump dressed in military uniform does not bode well for this new channels impartiality.  Thanks but I'll give it a miss.
onEdA8OV9po,"The US has succumb to authoritarian rule. The oligarchy just made it seem like we had a choice. And the economic model can only be followed by a few countries on earth because of the US's geography, natural resources. And the model is dependent on being the global economic number one."
onEdA8OV9po,"I'm excited because I like your point of view and presentation manner, better than VisualPolitik and different than most"
onEdA8OV9po,Itd be more accurate to say economics is inherently political.  Literally always have been.  the same economic theories we use are created from specific political backgrounds that prioritize certain factors over others.
onEdA8OV9po,👍👍
onEdA8OV9po,Can't wait to check out the new channel!
onEdA8OV9po,The framing of the universal basic income and that it would be worse if they believe in it portion rather than don't seems to belie your point about being objective
onEdA8OV9po,Cool
onEdA8OV9po,Good. Subbed.
onEdA8OV9po,thought you were going to talk about how this channel is mixing economics with leftist politics all of the time
onEdA8OV9po,But do you condemn Khamass.
onEdA8OV9po,"Good choice as economics has nearly zero impact on citizen prosperity. The topic we all should actually care about is the political level of benevolent representation the citizens have in the nation's. 

AFTER we have citizen control over governance THEN we can quibble about which economic models we want to apply to which industries."
onEdA8OV9po,"The second you said ""experts"" I knew it was just going to be another cookie cutter NPC leftist propaganda channel"
onEdA8OV9po,Just checked out the other channel.... sorry but no. Extremely left with no balance what so ever.
onEdA8OV9po,"Here's an idea about UBI... So far, most if not all experiments that were carried out had positive outcomes, but we need to ask ourselves, why? Why is it, that these results were positive. I am worried, that it is precisely, because they were limited in scope, that they had this good results. What would have happened, if such experiment were done at scale, for instance, entire 500000 pople worth a city? What would happen to inflation, particularly in segments of goods and services, that we need just to live? Particularly rent, utilities and food? Since demand here is severely inelastic, I am worried, that these, particularly rent, would skyrocket, because there would have been localised increase in aggregate amount of income in that particular city and nearly everything would get gobbled up by lnadlords, because they can set their prices how ever they want. Meaning UBI would be worthless, because it wouldn't address the primary cause of insufficience of money in hands of citizenry and worse, it's not even problem of low wages, because increasing them would run into the same problem. The lnadlord, or provider of inevadeable goods or services responding to the amount of money on local economy by raising prices, essentially behaving like a cartel, without ever creating one! Simply by following their alligned interests."
onEdA8OV9po,Hope in the future if you’re stepping out of Economics you draw better conclusions and take more of a macro view before you upload. The current Context Matters video is TRASH
onEdA8OV9po,"I was actually just thinking about why I love Economics Explained and why over time How Money Works has soured in my mouth.
Economics Explained is really focused on the function of economy; what and how. EE says words I've never heard of which gives me something to google and learn about, I love that.
Meanwhile How Money Works kinda just repeatedly spouts hate the rich talk, and I get it...but I don't LEARN from that. he sells outrage about things I already knew and EE provides insight.

I think EE will take the same approach to Geopolitics and I look forward to that."
onEdA8OV9po,Excellent!
onEdA8OV9po,Yes
onEdA8OV9po,The whole point of the Technocracy Movement of the early 20th century was to try to separate economics and politics. Sadly it failed.
onEdA8OV9po,"Y'all ain't neutral, stop acting like it. It's not a bad thing either, it doesn't weakens your analysis, but neutrality is a lie people tell themselves."
onEdA8OV9po,The US having one of the most robust democracies in the world while simultaneously having insurrection attempts.  Chilling.
onEdA8OV9po,Thank you for making more good stuff your new channel will no be followed
onEdA8OV9po,Excited for this! Hope that you do updates to old videos as stories develop more so into the future.
onEdA8OV9po,Super hyped for this!
onEdA8OV9po,"I was excited to see what you would do but after watching I guess I'm not surprised to see it is a hyper partisan channel.  I am disappointed. I was looking forward to seeing a neutral take on the politics surrounding different topics, but that is not what that channel is.

Go sub if that is what you are interested in that, I guess. I'll keep looking for a less biased source."
onEdA8OV9po,"""The Devastating Consequences of Mixing Economics & Politics"" basically that's why taxes, regulations and role of government should be lowered."
onEdA8OV9po,It’s my birthday today isn’t it
onEdA8OV9po,Liberals ruin everything. Speaking out against the woke left or the alphabet people have consequences. They will be the downfall of freedom as we know it today
onEdA8OV9po,"First off, everything any government does is the direct result of politics. This is why minarchism is ideal, the government that governs least governs best. Why should politicians and bureaucrats get to make decisions about healthcare, schools, roads, pensions, etc?

Secondly, the US is not a democracy, it's a republic.

Third, what keeps the US fairly stable is the wide checks, balances, horizontal and vertical divided interests within the government (most of the time). And also the fact that there are more guns than people and any attempt to become too authoritarian will result in those guns being used against the government, as the 2nd Amendment was intended."
onEdA8OV9po,You just make questions without answering single one till end of video
onEdA8OV9po,subscribing!
onEdA8OV9po,Very self aware and reasonable. See you in both channels
onEdA8OV9po,Skittles
onEdA8OV9po,"You are still pushing the easily disproven theory China's GPD is as much as 50% smaller. I don't think ""fact"" is something this channel have in abundance"
onEdA8OV9po,I have deja vu...
onEdA8OV9po,Thanks for the contents and wishing you all the best with the new channel.
onEdA8OV9po,"This will be great - as long as it's not too biased.  If all I hear is straight neoliberalism, then this new channel will fail to understand what's happening in the world, like most neoliberal elites today."
onEdA8OV9po,I'll check it oot
onEdA8OV9po,New channel seems very biased
onEdA8OV9po,"Say no more, subscribed with bell icon duly checked."
onEdA8OV9po,"As long as you're starting a new channel, can you give us a new presenter as well?  Aussies and Kiwis don;t have accents; they have speech impediments."
onEdA8OV9po,Bravo for acknowledging you needed to make another channel because of the politic aspects that have been omitted. 👍🏻
onEdA8OV9po,❤
onEdA8OV9po,"How you become the US Dictator video on the new channel was very disappointing. You have received my very first dislike on your content, hopefully the last."
onEdA8OV9po,"I am a small business owner, and I took microeconomics in college. It would be amazing if you made or could point us to a channel that talked about microeconomics. Like game theory, supply and demand, and monopolies!"
onEdA8OV9po,Love it. Keep up the good work 👍
onEdA8OV9po,"1938 German Economy was Good, but Politics Bad, so it is Bad?
1978 Chinese Economy was Good, but Politics Bad, so it is Bad?"
onEdA8OV9po,So against this it actually makes me less interested in EE by association
onEdA8OV9po,Awesome
voStqUm_DTM,As an ohioan I'm proud to say I did my part and now America elected a competent president
voStqUm_DTM,"no PA  does. and did. we were told this multiple times on NPR.  we need election over haul, take the money out of it, get rid of the electoral college, do popular vote, put ALL PARTEIS  on the debate stage, mandatory retirement age of 72,   and for our Scotus and judges...term limits and WE vote them in and out."
voStqUm_DTM,"Break the Chains of a Corrupt System: A Call to the Present

We’re caught in the grip of a distorted, corrupt capitalism—one where a small elite profits from inequality, control, and fear. This isn’t the promise of opportunity or the rewards of hard work. This is capitalism gone wrong, where human lives and freedoms are sacrificed to protect profits and uphold a narrow, oppressive vision of society. When corporations and certain policymakers align to reshape democracy itself, we’re no longer part of an economy built for all. We’re just fuel for their machine.

The Heritage Foundation’s recent policies under “Project 2025” represent this distorted vision. They propose a world where LGBTQ+ people are denied rights, where women’s autonomy is erased, and where minorities face increasing barriers to equity and opportunity. This vision isn’t about the true potential of capitalism, where innovation and fair competition create better lives. It’s about control and dominance. They want to restrict definitions of family, roll back gender protections, and undermine gains in civil rights—all to create a society that benefits only a few while silencing the many.

True capitalism, when just, offers chances for everyone to succeed based on their own merit, encouraging innovation, dignity, and growth. Corrupt capitalism, however, thrives on systemic inequality, offering rights and resources only to the privileged. This corrupted version sustains itself by making us believe that we are powerless, that this is simply “how things are.” But that’s their lie.

Imagine what happens if we simply refuse. If we pull back our labor and refuse to fuel this corrupt machine. By choosing not to work, we assert our power and remind them that it’s our collective labor that upholds the system. A just economy doesn’t fear this truth—it thrives on it. But this distorted capitalism fears it because it depends on our compliance.

By refusing to participate, we expose its weaknesses and its reliance on our silence. We don’t refuse to support the idea of fair capitalism; we refuse to uphold a system that manipulates, that erases the dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals, that tells women their rights are negotiable, and that sees minorities as expendable.

Let’s reclaim our future by stopping now. Let’s choose not to work for a system that strips us of freedom and equality. Together, let’s demand a fair, inclusive economy—one that values us all."
voStqUm_DTM,I HATE AND DISPISE THIS PEUTRIDE STINKY LITTLE STATE DECIDES THE ELECTION.
voStqUm_DTM,"Obama - 65m votes
Biden - 81m votes
harris - 66m votes
Nothing fishy or anything. Just a fluke."
voStqUm_DTM,I cant believe Liz Cheney's endorsement didn't work 😕
voStqUm_DTM,But they shouldn't be lying in the campaigns either. That should be considered voter manipulation.
voStqUm_DTM,OH YES AMERICA SHOULD BE SO PROUD TO HAVE A SEXUAL ABUSER AND CONVICTED FELON AS WELL AS AN INSURRECTIONIST AND MURDER OF CAPITAL POLICE OFFICERS  THAT TRYED TO OVER THROW AN ELECTION IN 2020 AS PRESIDENT ! THANK YOU SUPREME COURT FOR YOUR STUPIDITY!!!
voStqUm_DTM,He is correct.
voStqUm_DTM,"When given the choice between a right-winger and a right-winger, people vote for the right-winger every time.  That’s why Biden won in 2020.  That and Covid."
voStqUm_DTM,White women decided this election.  Too bad Obummer went after black men.  Black men voted for Kopmala at over 80%.  What percentage of white women voted for Kopmala?
voStqUm_DTM,"Ohio ✔️ 
Suck it"
voStqUm_DTM,"This is grounds for Issue #1 to be resubmitted for a vote ! !  Smart people read that ballot and were TRICKED into voting against their wishes.  I read it several times and voted NO ! !  Not what I wanted, not to keep the gerrymandering legal  ! ! !  Call for a Class Action lawsuit against the Republicans who wrote that completely false summary  ! ! !"
voStqUm_DTM,issue 1 in ohio . I read the discription and was going to vote no as it reads that voting yes would continue gerrymandering.  outside red signs read voting no would end gerrymandering.  in addition a Republican stooge in the parking lot was vocally trying to convince people to vote no saying it would end Democrats gerrymandering the state. wtf. fortunately my sense told me just no yes as you thought you understood the issue in weeks prior to the election. 🎉
voStqUm_DTM,issue #1 failed
voStqUm_DTM,It’s over.
voStqUm_DTM,"Ohio Sec of State Frank LaRose just changed the attire code when voting.  NOW, your voting attire just cannot have a candidates face or name on it.  He may have changed it just yesterday.  

No shit - had an old man come in to vote at the polls today wearing a red MAGA hat and a black trash bag over his shirt.   😂

Harris signage was removed from the roadway up to the polls (where they were allowed outside the 100’ no-zone) by someone at the school we vote at.   They 100% were allowed to be there.  We couldn’t get them back up 🤬

Most of our very few Harris/Walz signs throughout our small town of Jackson, Ohio have either been vandalized, destroyed or removed.  However we did at least manage to get the republican candidates to massively overspend and over-respond, huge signs and massive amounts of signs everywhere in a very red county 😂.  Glad we could help drain their coffers 🤣"
voStqUm_DTM,"I'm so disgusted with our Republican state officials. As an old cat lady, I voted blue, I voted for my daughter and granddaughter."
voStqUm_DTM,David Pepper keeps the Republicans in power for 20 years.
voStqUm_DTM,Ohio only has fascist idiot politicians!  They should not decide anything!
voStqUm_DTM,"Well, Reagan was the very next Republican president after FNB v Bellotti... A very logical follow up, I'd say.

The 2 Dems in Buckley v Valeo were APPOINTED BY REPUBLICANS, by the way... NIXON being one of them!!!

IT'S A REPUBLICAN AGENDA!

THE MODERN-DAY ATTACK ON DEMOCRACY STARTED THE DAY FDR DIED!!!"
voStqUm_DTM,I voted no because of the language. I couldn't find any news outlet that would cover the wording of this issue. Why would you vote yes to removing constitutional protections against gerrymandering or vote yes to those put on the committee having no accountability. That language didn't sound confusing to me. It sounded like giving carte Blanc to this committee to do what they want and we can't do anything about it. I saw no language that sounded like this issue would end gerrymandering .
voStqUm_DTM,This 66 year old woman voted for Sherrod Brown and 💙💙💙 all the way!
voStqUm_DTM,"First hand experience, Moreno is an Uber Douche. He's slimy AF."
voStqUm_DTM,"Ohio wants to get rid of these folks, but they just won't leave."
voStqUm_DTM,When will america wake up to the flawed electoral collage. Republicans haven't won the popular vote in decades yet they seem to dictate terms from gov and scotus down.
voStqUm_DTM,"Even when he looses  , he will control the MAGA Movement !
And they will terrify the party leaders to his and their will ,
Until there is no recognizable shred of the Republican party left !
It will probably take two or three more elections .
AND THEN ?"
voStqUm_DTM,Democrats have become so republican that Republicans have only crazy right to go .
voStqUm_DTM,I sure hope not …
voStqUm_DTM,"Putin for President, Trump for puppet master, vote like you're life depends on it, because it does..."
voStqUm_DTM,I did my research on Issue 1 and voted yes and blue down the line.
voStqUm_DTM,I have watched your show religiously since your days at AIr America Radio 2008👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
voStqUm_DTM,Two men discussing something only a woman can understand. I hope the women in my life understand most of us meant no harm.
voStqUm_DTM,The 3 major cities in ohio have always been heavy blue. Then toss in toledo and dayton
voStqUm_DTM,Come on Ohio vote blue
voStqUm_DTM,"So, Ohio is doing what Michigan did six years ago."
voStqUm_DTM,Ohio here..I voted BLUE down the ballot..like to make this a swing state again!!!
voStqUm_DTM,That is what they do is write it to confuse
voStqUm_DTM,"My gerrymandered congressional district is called ""The Snake On The Lake""."
voStqUm_DTM,"come on Ohio, vote blue like your life depends on it."
voStqUm_DTM,After JD Vance lied about an entire town in Ohio it's a wonder they'd wanna vote Republican.
voStqUm_DTM,"Rich Republican territory in Cincinnati! I am in Cleveland,  poorest large city in America , along with Detroit!"
BAoV8lrAy88,"The Propaganda Media like you, Spewing Hate Towards Trump, and Lying on a Daily Basis Helped Trump get Re-elected."
BAoV8lrAy88,Need more Thomas Crookes
BAoV8lrAy88,You got it. And that is why Trump won.
BAoV8lrAy88,Free speech comes with a responsibility to be skeptical and to seek out the truth.  Americans have become too overwhelmed and lazy to take on that responsibility. We no longer deserve free speech and so we will lose it.
BAoV8lrAy88,Thom…they weren’t tricked.  They liked what he said and voted for him!
BAoV8lrAy88,I didnt vote for him.  I am not an idiot.
BAoV8lrAy88,"The truth of the matter is kamala Harris would have been good for this country, and Donald Trump is gonna be bad. People know this but I think this election was more about race and color because we all know who was the better qualified candidate. November 5th just proved to be a day that white America failed this country because a woman of color could have been our next president. The level of racism is still real in this country!!!"
BAoV8lrAy88,If you didn't know this already you had your head in the sand
BAoV8lrAy88,Do not forget them focusing on Biden’s age and gaffs but will not talking about the 78 year old guy doing the same thing.  They will get their tax cuts while having double digit inflation and double digit drops in the GDP.
BAoV8lrAy88,"The whole problem was the "" intellectuals"" listened to Cardi B and the Conservatives listened to the American voter! Lmfao"
BAoV8lrAy88,Just poor dumb people
BAoV8lrAy88,"Aren't most business persons conservatives, especially the oligarchs? Trump's plans would enrich them, so do you think that greedflation was just to keep making profits but not also a way to manipulate the public and help rig the election? Just like when OPEC and our oil barons artificially keep prices higher before elections where Democrat presidents are in office or they keep prices lower when Republican presidents are in office?
Of course not all of it is deliberate, I believe that some of it is subconsciously being done because of the biases they/we have."
BAoV8lrAy88,Your out of touch. Democrats talk down and berate the working class.
BAoV8lrAy88,We can only go down from here. Fox News brainwashed 50% of Americans.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Also, it seems the algorithms have changed the minds of our social media followers. They had the Democrats on the ropes with social media radicalizing algorithms."
BAoV8lrAy88,Tricked? 😂 wake up you idio”’ts. The American people literally saw the 18% accumaulated inflation for the disastrous 4 years are the Biden Harris administration. The fact that you people support inflation literally says you want the US to be destroyed.
BAoV8lrAy88,That's correct about the Media
BAoV8lrAy88,Buckle up America is going to get what it deserves!! Project  2025 is going to destroy our economy!!
BAoV8lrAy88,"In every measurable way, everything is better right now under the Biden admin’s governance than it was under trump’s buffoonery. That is why all of us outside of the US can’t believe what we are seeing. It seems absolutely impossible and totalling bewildering that so many Americans want to go back to that mess with that despicable, conman convicted felon. We’ve beamed to some alternate universe where up is down and straight forward some how circles back around behind you, it just doesn’t square. Not sure who said this but I quote, “The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.”"
BAoV8lrAy88,Lol.... im loving all of the Trump Derangement im seeing. Its hilarious.
BAoV8lrAy88,I blame Fox News and McConnell for trump.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Mt pencil neck podcast Bozo.
You're out of a job"
BAoV8lrAy88,You hit the nail on the head with this video.  Thank you.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Trump has tricked the people, he has lied to them. I remember him telling people ""Joe Biden is the worst president"", Biden fixed the USA economy, for which, I suspect, Trump will take the credit."
BAoV8lrAy88,Yes.... Now what do we do about it?
BAoV8lrAy88,"Murdoch started out in tabloids, and has stayed with disinformation since."
BAoV8lrAy88,"The Democrats tricked me into voting for Trump, with their open borders and tampons in the boy's room."
BAoV8lrAy88,Fox News was owned by Russia. Would it still be on the air? I don’t think so.
BAoV8lrAy88,This result is all on the Democrats!
BAoV8lrAy88,"Amen! Why are you the  only Voice Courageous & Intelligent enough to speak Truth To the  People? !?!  Broadcast ""News"" is a pitiful joke. The anchors are NOT journalists, critical thinkers, ask pedestrian questions,  happily accept whatever response is offered, and seemingly without the capacity to control a narrative. Plus, not one network called out or challenged the veracity of the FOX content; I guess they left that task to the  late night comics."
BAoV8lrAy88,"I think it's the price level, the result of high-ish inflation in 2022 and 2023. I lived through the inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s and Biden's 9% was a quick ouch then the recovery started. In the 70s and 80s it continued to get worse for almost a decade. People want 2019 prices and think that re-electing Trump will restore the lower prices."
BAoV8lrAy88,We have an intelligence problem in America
BAoV8lrAy88,"I am afraid this is a growing tendency. Russia is an example of censorship. May other countries are doing the same. ow Trump threatens those who don.t support hum. Even in the UK we are seeing Tory sites on You Tube giving biased information, spreading hate and lies which go unchecked.  Respect for opposing views is disappearing and it is either agree with me or I will attack you i any way I can."
BAoV8lrAy88,"No Americans were ""tricked"" into voting a particular way.  There is propaganda available from both sides, and if you choose to believe the propaganda based on lies, bigotry, paranoia, and ignorance then that is YOUR fault.  You were not tricked, you made a delusional and destructive choice."
BAoV8lrAy88,"It’s all Fox News’s fault. No discernment whatsoever! Maybe they picked the worse possible candidate with no message other than women have the right to murder your baby and Orange Man Bad. Not to mention calling anyone you don’t agree with racists, idiots, sexists, etc. You guys will NEVER get it!"
BAoV8lrAy88,"another millionaire, just sayin we will never have this kind of dough, just sayin how could anyone with money understand"
BAoV8lrAy88,NEVER NEWS FOX IS NOT NEWS  IT IS NOTHING BUT LIES 24/7  THEY ARE THE ENEMY WITHIN  ONLY STUPID PPL BELIEVE THEIR LIES  THEY ARE PURE EVIL
BAoV8lrAy88,"god tell us something we dont know, obviously nobody cares about the overwhelming power of the right wing media or they would do something about it, there is a huge disconect here bodyless heads this is wrong"
BAoV8lrAy88,How in the heck are there still over 20 million valid votes missing where did they go they don't have feet to walk away you know with all the voter suppression that they did on the other side of the aisle you know trying to stop people from voting when in fact the other side of the aisle are the ones that were doing fraudulent votings double triple different counties different states getting caught burning mailboxes the guy did nothing but go out to hate rallies even on his own supporters that's what he does but what I don't understand is where did these votes go it doesn't add up it does not make no sense where did they go did they give them to the dirty bird is why he won or what was it election interference from different countries you know like 2016 who knows fake news 🦊 is just that propaganda channel who has many many many many many many many many channels all over the world propaganda
BAoV8lrAy88,Democrats are terrible at messaging.
BAoV8lrAy88,You guys are trying to trick people with common sense that is is ok to put men in women's bathrooms and have drag queens read to little kids.  Check yourself!
BAoV8lrAy88,"Bc of corporate greed, even with a strong economy most people  still struggle bc Gas, Groceries,  Utilities.  Regardless of who created it, it didn't get fixed in time. That plus FOX didn't help."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Demo-crazy does not work. Let's see how safe ppl will be under Trump. Transgender, imigrants, lbtz, prounouns and many more have an unsertain future."
BAoV8lrAy88,"From the very start, America has been a lie. America grabbed the land from the native people who lived here, and nearly wiped them off the planet.
This was ok at the time and still seems ok with most Americans.
Lots of treaties and agreements were mad but it was all bunk.
It was murder in the first degree.
So the USA is not so noble in my opinion after all."
BAoV8lrAy88,Wishful thinking? I’d say Trump voters were not tricked! It made sense! It was the logical thing to do!
BAoV8lrAy88,and Murdoch damaged Australian security against China
BAoV8lrAy88,Trump already appointed two Bush era neocons on his administration
BAoV8lrAy88,"Thom, just use the extra 20 million votes the dems used in 2020 to beat Trump's record breaking vote tallies..  2012, 2016 and 2024 were all within the vote tally benchmarks.. what was different about 2020.. oh that's right,  YouTube prevents that discussion.. dang right wing social media.."
BAoV8lrAy88,"It’s not that. The economy may be the strongest economy but it doesn’t feel that way. Rent, and groceries are way too high and people are struggling. People thought it was better when Trump was in. So yes the economy is great but if it’s not actually felt b6 people they won’t vote for it."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Americans weren't tricked into voting him, they simply had enough of how the current term has been leading this country for the past 4 years. The real question should be why did the democrats lose the election and there's a fine list of reasons why ya'll have been let down."
BAoV8lrAy88,Finally some common sense and reality. Thank you.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Yup. This is the heart of it. Murdoch ruined America with systematic disinformation that pressed the ever reliable buttons of fear, hate, envy and pride, and evangelicals wrapped it in Jesus. But knowing that also tells us where we need to look for the repair. Disinformation must be made illegal, as it once was before Reagan to the guardrails off, and it must be subject to challenge in the courts. Where there is a harm, there must be a remedy."
BAoV8lrAy88,Lol the same fox who has to cough up  785 million dollar lies and maga nutballs fall for anything!
BAoV8lrAy88,"Average citizen is outraged when you say “the economy is good”. You are right that by major indicators of economic health we are in great position. Unfortunately, those of us with average income feel like the economy is bad because inflation was high after Covid worldwide. You have to explain where the inflation came from every time you explain economics."
BAoV8lrAy88,"lies and misinformation, Bernie sander pretty much summed it up"
BAoV8lrAy88,The Morlock is not popular in Australia. He's from Adelaide.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Biden and Harris tricked people into voting for Trump. This is what happens when you spend 4 years f*cking up everything at every move you make, and then spend all your time attempting people not to believe your own eyes because they are lying to ya."
BAoV8lrAy88,What about all the Americans who were tricked into not voting as well?
BAoV8lrAy88,USA MORONS!!!
BAoV8lrAy88,"The big news networks aside, today a lot of the firehose of constant misinformation is from online podcasts and armies of millions of bots spreading lies on social media feeds. The podcasts and social media issues specifically effect young people."
BAoV8lrAy88,Trump ruined us with COVID!  LOST JOBS. KEPT US IN THE HOUSE. NO MONEY EARNED.
BAoV8lrAy88,"I almost always agree with you, but I'm going to have to differ with you on this one. The economy as a whole may be doing well, but all of the games are being siphoned away to the rich elite at the top. The average person is not feeling this improved economy, or if they are, they're only feeling very slight improvement. 

A lot of the claims that the economy is doing better rest on stock market performance, which really is nothing more than an indication of how happy rich people are. While it is true that unemployment is extremely low, wages have not kept up with inflation, and many of those jobs that were created are low wage. 


As to your claim that this is the strongest economy that the United States has ever had, people lived a much better life with just one person in a household working 40 hours a week back in the 1960s than they do today. Democrats have a real problem. They are afraid to offer any populist messaging and are terrified of and acting any populist policy. They are so worried about appealing to Republicans that they keep thumbing their nose at their base. 

What did we see in this past election? Donald Trump made a lot of empty promises that make people in his base feel good. Just like his last presidency, he's not going to do the economic things that he said he would do, but he told people he would do it. 

Democrats try so hard to come across as Republican-lite. This alienates their base and simultaneously it still gets them rejected by Republicans because Republicans are not going to vote for a republican-lite candidate when they can vote for the full fat Republican. 

This problem started back in 2016 when the DNC railroaded Bernie Sanders, and it continued in 2020 when Bernie Sanders was absolutely crushing it and the DNC coalesced behind Joe Biden and everybody dropped out and gave him all their delegates. Do you think that Democrats didn't see that? Do you think that we don't remember that? I voted for Kamala Harris because I feel that it was still the best thing to do despite the fact that I wasn't very enthused about her at all. Quite frankly, I wish the ticket had been inverted and it was a Walz-Harris ticket."
BAoV8lrAy88,"People were not expecting social media which has an instant constant advertising effect never known before in media, plus earth spreading hate speech that ripples through the air waves, and slight of hand, a conspiracy of big business to not endorse any candidate which they always did and people always expected, gave the win to Trump.  We wear it on our cell phones, to that has an instant and constant effect inside our brains and when it is filtered to a particular sound quality, that is what they expect and brainwashing happens."
BAoV8lrAy88,The ignorant Trump followers are in for a rude awakening.
BAoV8lrAy88,Bravo Thom!!!  I stopped watching MSM (main stream media) many months ago because of the BS they were spewing.  Only one I stayed with is ABC.  MEIDAS Touch & their affiliates are doing a great job fact checking djt's  lies.  Thanks Thom for your efforts!!
BAoV8lrAy88,"We weren't tricked into anything. 
  Democrats just couldn't and or wouldn't get away from identify politics and they lost the majority of the everyday normal working class Americans. Democrats lost their common sense.  
 They did nothing but talk about how Trump will destroy our democracy and how bad orange man is. 

Well democracy prevailed as it always has in this constitutional republic system  of democracy not to be confused with the democratic system. 
    
  Birney sanders knows why dems lost and dems lost cause they really had no plan for anything except keeping Trump from office. 

Get back to facts and truth. 
And the truth is the economy and border is what the normal working class Americans care about. 
 We don't care about pronouns and ones identity. 
   Nor is abortion our main issue. 
  That's a state issue not federal."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Also, Bernie Sanders is correct. The Democratic Party has a abandoned the working class for so long now the working class has abandoned the Democratic Party.."
BAoV8lrAy88,"The corrupt corporate media is so obvious to this innocent bystander in Canada. It is a universal phenomenon. Perhaps, as a culture, or through better Canadian education, Canadians seem to be more skeptical of biased private news broadcasting than Americans. It is unfortunate than NPR is not recognized as a potential benchmark to check reporting from other sources. Without ethical standards and truth in broadcasting regulations, the US Constitution's free speech amendment is abused and as a corollary, stupidity is tolerated in the USA. This toleration of falsehoods and foolishness in the name of FREEDOM will be the downfall of the USA. Guaranteed."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Fox news benefits the most from the first amendment. They are allowed to plainly lie about everything that goes against their interests. Fox news viewers are the opposite of 'woke,' they are being manipulated and they are completely unaware."
BAoV8lrAy88,All MSM is complicit
BAoV8lrAy88,EVEN  MSNBC  AIRED  HIM  ENOUGH  TO  GET  HIM  UPPERMOST  IN  THEIR  MINDS   JUST  ALWAYS  BEHIND  A MIC   REPULSIVE  GOON.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Eventually the electorate will have to take RESPONSIBILITY for their own election choices.  Stop blaming Kamala or the DEMS, it is up to each individual to take full responsibility.  All the white women who voted for Trump are now learning he will enact a bill from 1871 that will subjugate them.   They now see that the GOP definitely plans to enact a national abortion ban and take away birth control.  Until people take responsibility for their voting choices and the decision to be informed or ignorant, America is doomed."
BAoV8lrAy88,Liars and cheaters have won!
BAoV8lrAy88,"Trump broke our laws to steal the election from HRC, then he lost re-election and launched a coup attempt,  HE ABSOLUTELY BROKE OUR LAWS AGAIN, TO REGAIN THE PRESIDENCY in 2024."
BAoV8lrAy88,"9 years, 3 elections: trump face zero consequences for committing  CRIMES IN OUR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONs"
BAoV8lrAy88,"Good old Rupert has pulled off another miracle. And Lachlan is even more ruthless. Buckle up America, for the ride of your life."
BAoV8lrAy88,maybe the dems should stop hating their base.  stop telling gaza protestors to shut up.  stop telling people that isreal is NOT committing a genocide.
BAoV8lrAy88,"The MSM is owned by the five biggest corporations in the USA -- they were all in the tank for Trump.  This is partially why he won -- they wanted him to win, and they refused to cover him and treat him like the actual threat to democracy that he was (and still is) - and now we get to see just how much damage he will do to this country (because Joe Biden doesn't have the stones to do what's necessary to protect this country from him).  I feel very sad for the future of this country, and I am extremely concerned for the future of the entire world as a whole because of the myopic shortsightedness of the people who wanted to win at any cost.  (Sadly, I also worry about my own future, because I too am one of those who constantly criticize Trump for his stupidity, his mendacity, and his obsequiousness to Trump)."
BAoV8lrAy88,America 🇺🇸 REJECTED the extreme far left
BAoV8lrAy88,"it's absolutely frustrating that the MSM normalized Trump to the point that they convince a majority of the American public that he had ""changed his ways"" where they could trust him again.  It's utterly shameful and disgraceful that the billionaires will now introduce to the American public the horrors they would never have imagined in their wildest dreams (or nightmares) -- and they will ultimately be asking ""Why did this happen?"" when they would never contemplate their fellow Americans telling them ""I told you so."""
BAoV8lrAy88,Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.
BAoV8lrAy88,You’re a little piece of stool  hartman
BAoV8lrAy88,Fox news is the enemy of the state !!!!
BAoV8lrAy88,"Americans weren’t tricked… they showed their true face with election, just like the Germans did in the 30s. No one was “tricked” this is what happens when nations show their true face"
BAoV8lrAy88,Where do you get this BS. Trump has accomplished more in the short time since the election than the biden/harris has in 4yrs. Hamas threw the white flag. Putin is in line . Evidently the dems dislike prosperity . Idiots
BAoV8lrAy88,Boycott the media until they report the truth.
BAoV8lrAy88,The people have been thinking the country is going in the wrong direction irrespective of who was is power for the last 20 years.
BAoV8lrAy88,Pro-democracy channels need to band together to debunk right wing lies and conspiracies.
BAoV8lrAy88,Fox News only has about 8 to 10 million viewers. Over 70 million voted for Trump.
BAoV8lrAy88,Yeah! Another deeply media storh! Not zurprised! Mainstream media lied about trump ! The media screwed up!💙💙💙was💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
BAoV8lrAy88,Not going to work but great speeches they like being in a cult
BAoV8lrAy88,Yea all the news channels were on trump side with sll his lies they would not fact check his lies!
BAoV8lrAy88,People’s rents are off the chart Knucklehead.
BAoV8lrAy88,Fox News needs to be sued
BAoV8lrAy88,You are so full of BS you are a Commie & a Doofus
BAoV8lrAy88,By the truth .
BAoV8lrAy88,"Nah, it's more about how many Americans tricked those into thinking they'd actually get off their obese azz to vote...which was a vote for donnie 2 diapers, btw"
BAoV8lrAy88,I been saying this forever. My neighbors didn’t know about foxes 787million defamation payout or why Tucker Carlson was fired and they only watch Fox.
BAoV8lrAy88,Biden screw up the democrats big time fjb Harris needed to distance her more
BAoV8lrAy88,You are a damn fraud. You lied to us for months now ..... I am ashamed of you.
BAoV8lrAy88,If your watching fox news you wasn't being tricked you probably voted for trump last time
BAoV8lrAy88,Clown 🤡.
BAoV8lrAy88,If you believe Hartmann then you are truly the idiot
BAoV8lrAy88,Mass deportation and increase in tariffs are both inflationary!!!
BAoV8lrAy88,An economy that is the envy of the world and is starring us all in the face. Millions of unfilled jobs.  The Maga's chose the felon over the prosecutor. We will soon all be watching the deconstruction of Democracy as we've known it.
BAoV8lrAy88,Hartman you are just a cretin.
BAoV8lrAy88,The NY Times is a disgrace. Perpetuating the false equivalency of the 2 Political Parties is reprehensible.
BAoV8lrAy88,"I am fully done with excuses given to us Americans.  Americans have allowed themselves to become dumber every year that passes.  The stupidity of the general public far surpasses any prior stupidity in human history…and people are FULLY responsible for this choice to burn it to the ground.  They fully deserve everything that is coming to them in every way.  They made a choice knowing FULL well all aspects of what that choice entails.  Period.  Whatever comes, whatever happens, they fully chose and deserve every bit of it and nothing less.  When you choose destruction over creation, when you choose to bring harm to members of your own family, when you cannot see how misguided and led astray you have become, you are 100% responsible for ALL that entails.  There is no excuse and no leniency and no sympathy deserved!  None!  Just as George Conway stated in his article in The Atlantic yesterday, I was sadly and profoundly wrong in assuming that people were wiser and more decent than they actually turned out to be.  This will be the very last time I will make that mistake about the American people.

That people can still so very easily be driven by their baser nature is dumbfounding to me in the extreme.  250,000 years since Homo sapiens sapiens first appeared, and the internal nature of the average human has barely changed.  Still afraid of its own shadow and anything and everything it’s little brain doesn’t understand and won’t try, still willing to kill at the drop of a hat, still thinking it knows things it clearly does not, let alone the deranged thinking it knows what is best for others when it can barely wipe its own butt, still cannot differentiate truth from fiction, and not a whit closer to knowing these things about itself.  Still only caring about itself and everyone else be damned, still unknowing and uncaring that it is part of a vast wholeness and will not survive without understanding that, and still 100% gullible to any snake oil salesman that comes along, nevermind the VAST history of walking this path that predicts the outcome of it with 100% accuracy.  If 250,000 years to evolve out of the basest of instincts is not enough, I am HIGHLY skeptical that any amount of time will be enough."
BAoV8lrAy88,"How bout Democrats come up with a policy that helps Americans....hating Trump is not a policy. Wake up and realize ""why"" you lost. $8.78 for a dozen eggs. Stop blaming and be accountable.  And Joe Biden reversed Stay in  Mexico.  Fox was right about Russia...the laptop...the vaccine....should i go on. Your the wreckage in America."
BAoV8lrAy88,Why talk about it now????WHY DONT YOU COUNTER/CHALLENGE the narrative when you had the your chance...STFUP now
BAoV8lrAy88,"The real problem is human nature, specifically confirmation bias. Most of us tend to seek out news sources that tell us what we want to hear. We end up in our own epistemic bubbles and echo chambers. Most of Americans are not seekers of truth and facts. Most Americans seek confirmation of their biases. Case in point: When FOX News announced that Biden won in 2020, thousands left FOX News in favor of NewsMax that was telling them election was stolen. They didn't seek the uncomfortable facts. They wanted to be comforted by lies. If we hear info that makes us uncomfortable, we tend to find ways to avoid and dismiss it, even if it's true. If we hear something we believe, we're not likely to fact-check it even if it's false. If you like what Trump is saying, you believe his lies and your news echo system is not fact checking Trump."
BAoV8lrAy88,if there is ever another vote Dems need to demand Fox News license be withdrawn for actively spreading lies to its viewers
BAoV8lrAy88,"this is the truth ,plan and simple"
BAoV8lrAy88,There was no trickery involved we looked at our wallets and pursestrings and figured out the culprits and grifters do i need to go further if you dont understand who im talking about?
BAoV8lrAy88,they don't need to be tricked. trump and his party have been openly fascist throughout the campaign. over half your population  wanted a fascist and so they got him.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Yes, Democrats are the party of science and the fetus is a blob of tissue. That Whopper has been good for 50 years."
BAoV8lrAy88,"True words about the Murdoch press. British by birth and Australian for the past 40 yrs, I have watched on with horror.   Lies, lies and more lies. They own 70% of printed media in Australia. They have trashed every aspect of what was held dear as Australians, mateship, fair go…."
BAoV8lrAy88,We where not tricked! The elite progressive Dems and phoney news media convinced us that we are being lied to.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Thom, Majority of the Americans now are Brainwashed and like you said allot of them are getting their information from FOX NEWS. They are all going to get a very RUDE awakening when Trump takes over on Day 1.  
We still don't know about the House of Rep. but the Senate is now controlled by the GOP.  If the GOP also retains control of the  House of Rep. we are deep deep trouble with what both branches of Government can and will do.
Heaven help us to get through this crisis with our Government and felon President.
Thanks for your video."
BAoV8lrAy88,You can't even really blame fox for this. It's all the propaganda on tiktok and instagram. They went for everybody eighteen to thirty five and make him seem normal.
BAoV8lrAy88,"They weren't tricked, they voted trump so they can scream the ""n"" word at black people in public with immunity/police protection...nothing else, but keep lying to yourself"
BAoV8lrAy88,Massive propaganda and misinformation campaign that's been syndicated across the rightwing media machine for years now.  Democrats were simply too inept to counter it.  They never saw it coming.
BAoV8lrAy88,"I think it's because everything is so expensive. The economy is great for greedy corporations, but for the people living paycheck to paycheck it's the same ol' struggle."
BAoV8lrAy88,Republicans never talk about increasing minimum wage for American workers plus they always go against unions.  Biden tried to increase minimum wage to 20 hours an hour but 2 fake Democrats in the Senate and all Senate Republicans voted against Bidens minimum wage increase.
BAoV8lrAy88,The right wing noise machine was constantly spewing BS and a very large part of the populace believed it all!
BAoV8lrAy88,4 years? More like 20. And now Elon's got Xitter to spread lies on too. Heather Cox Richardson pointed out that a lot of folks saw massive follower drops yesterday on Xitter. Her theory is un-needed bots signing out.
BAoV8lrAy88,"For years I been making excuses for the mainstream media but about 18 months ago I had had it. It is now crystal clear  that the mainstream media-and by that I mean ABC, NBC, CBS,  Wall Street Journal, LA Times, New York Times, etc WANT Donald Trump to be president. Were they honest brokers, all they would have to do is show the clips of Donald Trump at his rallies where he is completely unhinged saying the most insane things, and that would be a public service announcement to the voting public to prevent us from going down the road of project 2025. Then they could compare that to the calm enthusiastic jam-packed Kamala Rally's. But instead they jump on every little Kamala said or didn't say. The mainstream media seldom out and out lies, but what they do is simply not report important things or quickly drop a story after the initial if it tends to make Trump look bad; or hammer Kamala but not Trump even though he promises to act like a dictator. We must never forget that ABC, CBS and NBC,et al, are all part of corporate America. If you've ever seen a diagram of ""who owns what in America"" you would find that the media companies are either owned by some giant corporate conglomerate, or actually are corporate conglomerates themselves that own dozens of other corporations in a wide variety of fields. And every one of those corporations wants relaxation of regulations and tax breaks simply because that's what corporations do. Talk about a conflict of interest. And that is precisely why you are not seeing anything on the big three television channels of any substance regarding a critical look at the insanity of what Donald Trump says; you have to come to places like this on YouTube to see just how fõc-king mentally ill Trump actually is. Somebody recently came up with the perfect term for what the mainstream media is doing: sane washing. The big-three TV Folk won't show you the president yammering on and on about Hannibal Lecter but they will clean it mansplaining to us what Trump meant not what he said; sometimes even insert their own interpretation of what he said, all to protect him from close scrutiny by the public. Corporate America WANTS Donald Trump to win. And meanwhile Trump has convinced his rubes, that he's not like the 'elites' the rubes hate so passionately. He is being pumped with money by the elites to do favors for the elites . Trump and mainstream media are both part of the elite oligarchy that already has 60% of the control of this country. But with project 2025 we will be going to go down a black hole and be owned completely by Corporate America."
BAoV8lrAy88,OH ... THE COPIUM !!!😂😂😂😂😂
BAoV8lrAy88,"American companies and wall street are doing great, but that don't mean working class people are Thom. Lots of people are barely getting by and want change that the Democrats never deliver on! They have become the elitist party and have left behind the working class!"
BAoV8lrAy88,"I give up, we can never trust the mainstream media
We need more contact creators telling the truth"
BAoV8lrAy88,This information is a week late!!!!
BAoV8lrAy88,"Americans weren't tricked into voting for Trump. Look at the numbers. He got about 3.5 million more votes this time than last time. This is less than a 5% increase over his 2020 total. Democrats depend on the turnout of sometimes Democratic voters. They didn't turn out this time. Biden got 81 million votes in 2020. Harris got 67 million votes by today's tally. That's a gap of 14 million votes. That's all sometimes Democratic voters who didn't turn out to vote. They didn't turn out to vote for Harris because they only turn out to vote under two conditions: to stop the pain when a Republican administration has been hurting them and, to a lesser degree, to keep the good times rolling a Democratic incumbent. Neither of those conditions applied for Harris, so they didn't turn out for her. They wouldn't have turned out for Biden, either, because they don't like the price of eggs. Harris' only chance would have been to woo 5 million centrist Republicans. This could have been done, but Democratic Party doctrine maintains that the party platform has to be crafted to appeal to sometimes Democratic voters. The party doesn't understand that the sometimes voters turn out under specific conditions and not others. They continue to believe that they can turn out the sometimes voters in decisive numbers by wooing them with an attractive platform. They just don't get it. Harris would have had a better chance by tacking HARD to the right and stealing most of the normal Republican platform under the conditions that prevailed."
BAoV8lrAy88,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
BAoV8lrAy88,"Trump voter here, I don't watch fox news. Your narrative is wrong. That's why you don't get it, you are looking in the wrong place."
BAoV8lrAy88,"The reason many think the economy is not that good is because there are alot of Americans that do not hold stock portfolios like we do, own real estate like we do, they are trying to pay their bills and buy groceries. The economy is not booming for them. Immigration was huge in this election, the dems keep talking about this bill. Biden destroyed the boarder the day he took office and could fix it just as quick. Break down that bill and answer how would it fix the illegals crossing the border."
BAoV8lrAy88,"They weren’t tricked, they listened to there wallets instead of your pathetic propaganda."
BAoV8lrAy88,"POPULAR VOTE, c’mon, say it out loud."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Because people are still struggling. Rent is too high. Becoming homeowners is still too inaccessible to many working people. Wages have not kept up with inflation. 

You can talk about how great the economy is doing, but it's not trickling down. Those markers of a healthy economy make rich people richer. They aren't helping working people. The answer is to reverse the trend of moving toward oligarchal society. 

You are gaslighting people by ignoring the fact that we are still struggling financially because of a rigged system set up for the average person to always be behind."
BAoV8lrAy88,Yes.yes.yes truth in broadcasting laws needed .
BAoV8lrAy88,"This guy is so Wrong. He is out of touch with real people. Apparently he doesn't go grocery shopping.  He doesn't see and hear people talking about making choices of what products to buy or not buy.

He doesn't see the how Serious of a Security Issue all of this Illigal immigration is.

Nobody convinced me who to vote for.  I'm an old man and I've seen a thing or two. I've seen what Biden and Kamala have done wrong.  Also, Kamala has no business being President of the United States or anything else for that matter.  She doesn't know what to do.

I don't agree with everything any politician says, but Donald Trump is Far better than Kamala Harris is or ever will be.

."
BAoV8lrAy88,😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣. So stupid. You can always count on the left to never shut up and be a graceful loser. You just do comprehend reality. The reality is America is done with division from the left and propaganda.
BAoV8lrAy88,Murdoch said as much in his deposition - did Fox Viewers ever hear that?  NO
BAoV8lrAy88,Awesome Drugs you gotta be dropping Dude!
BAoV8lrAy88,Don’t forget NEWSMAX
BAoV8lrAy88,"At first, I was frustrated that he was elected. But after reflecting on it, I’ve started thinking about the underlying reasons why people voted for him.

Trump promises to restore their Christian values. Many on the right are uncomfortable with what they see as “wokeness” — issues like pronoun usage, transgender athletes in sports, same-sex marriage, abortion, immigration impacting their communities, crime affecting their businesses, and concerns over limitations on police authority. This is fundamentally about preserving their religious and traditional values.

I didn’t fully grasp this initially, but now it makes sense. Look at where Trump’s rallies were held — often in churches or evangelical areas. Recall how he held up a Bible during the BLM protests. Figures like JD Vance have openly embraced Christianity; Marjorie Taylor Greene shares religiously-rooted views, and even Tucker Carlson frames issues in terms of good versus evil. His supporters don’t need to attend rallies; they connect with his message in their churches. Many churches even faced fines for endorsing Trump, which only strengthened their support.

This is about defending religious values. Recognizing this allows us to engage more meaningfully and perhaps find common ground.

Approximately 63% of Americans identify as religious. If we examine religious affiliation among Republicans and Democrats, it’s clear how this aligns with Trump’s support base.

We can’t win the vote if a majority believes that our actions oppose their values. Belief is powerful. Many of his followers see Trump as a divine messenger or even a ruler chosen by God. He seems untouchable, like a king of old, whose missteps are seen as part of a larger plan.

It might sound extreme, but we often miss this perspective because we don’t view things the same way. This movement has a near-cult-like devotion, and it’s deeply woven into the popular vote."
BAoV8lrAy88,If dead Americans voted for Biden in 2020.  Alot of dead Russians voted for trump in 2024.
BAoV8lrAy88,Most American media supported a criminal liar. And were mad when Democrats responded to a man that couldn't speak two sentences without insulting and lies.
BAoV8lrAy88,"It will indeed be interesting when, due to the Trump tariffs & deportations, both prices & inflation rise significantly - yet Fox News & the others regularly report that the Economy is just FINE ! Never been BETTER !
Then perhaps the populace may realize that the Right Wing media has a propensity to lie to them to support the Republican party...however, I would imagine that these viewers would simply BELIEVE these sources, thinking that perhaps some devious Liberal is following them around & raising the prices on products right before they buy them, or that the particular store they are in is some front for the Democratic party trying to scam them & make their beloved Trump look bad..."
BAoV8lrAy88,Spot on
BAoV8lrAy88,"Sorry folks,  both sides are evil."
BAoV8lrAy88,There are 787 million reasons not to watch Fox.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Most of the media is owned in large part by the billionaires who will benefit from Trump's America.
The media is in the business of profit, not of objective truth.  They are doing their masters' bidding.
Fox certainly profited by selling the lies - the rest were held back from the objective truth."
BAoV8lrAy88,"As a Democrat, the problem is how the government presents data. They changed how inflation is calculated in January, they make bizarre hedonistic adjustments, so inflation now is not calculated the same as in 1980. Same with unemployment. How can unemployment be 4% if 100 million able bodied adults aren’t in the work force? How can we have a great economy when a greater percentage of Americans are getting a tax refund every year than those who pay? If the economy were so great, everybody would be owing taxes every spring. It is not a Republican vs Democrat thing, but we seriously need to address how data is being manipulated. Data should be presented once using the same methods, not tinkered with or revised as needed. The missing voters are in the data, but if you try to sweep them under the rug, we will never have another Obama landslide."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Very true, the media has completely failed us.  I don't know how you combat all the misinformation, it's killing the country.  The dysfunctional government is powerless to do anything."
BAoV8lrAy88,It was a messaging issue for democrats for sure Fox News did the job they needed to do and democrats did what they’ve been doing and were told wouldn’t work at some point for years now. Republicans made undecided voters vote on a single issue and it worked while democrats tried to tell people what was important and didn’t listen to what those voters actually thought was important. It’s annoying but I can’t blame republicans for being better at conveying a message to voters than democrats.
BAoV8lrAy88,100% facts
BAoV8lrAy88,Really makes you think they are all in it together.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Lol, enjoy the last red boys."
BAoV8lrAy88,"This just goes to show that bullshitting people on a nightly basis is a useful skill set, even after Fox had to pay Dominion $780 million! I sincerely hope we get the opportunity to continue to try and vote the right people into office!"
BAoV8lrAy88,It more than Fox News..  It is also social media Tik-Tok and Facebook.  Facts don't matter to people that voted for Trump.
BAoV8lrAy88,"There is the reality of higher prices - food, housing, gas, etc"
BAoV8lrAy88,Racist people
BAoV8lrAy88,We as Americans have a duty to stay informed and participate in all our elections on all levels. So many people have such a casual attitude toward who there voting for. Know your candidate and what they stand for
BAoV8lrAy88,Bigot Amerikkka wants to maintain the same r@cial order...when they tell who they are.... believe them !!!
BAoV8lrAy88,the US has MAJOR media problem.. they need to be held accountable to tell the truth.
BAoV8lrAy88,You idiots just don't get it.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Don't scapegoat the media. Trump didn't grow his support. His voters are fine with fascism. Meanwhile, Harris somehow got 15M less votes than Biden did. So either something is fishy (which seems unlikely, given the margin), or sexism or/and racism were main factors in not voting her."
BAoV8lrAy88,Absolutely correct evaluation of the current state of affairs.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Look back in US history guys Trump is no worse than other Presidents. If you do not like living here, there are other countries you can live in."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Absolutely correct. Trump has lied about the economy, and Fox simply repeats this."
BAoV8lrAy88,FOX had nothing to do with it. Too many people from everywhere voted Trump. Think about how many people who experienced true hardship in the last 4 years. They don’t need the news to tell them anything..they feel it. Think about this: 100k+ people died per year from drug overdoses during this administration (which is not yet over)… how many people know somebody that died from Fentanyl? You think they all voted to Harris?
BAoV8lrAy88,"What people around the world needs to do is stop being lazy. I factchecks almost everything on internet and 7-8 times out of 10 they are telling a lei........ IT`S JUST LAZY PEOPLE OUT THERE, DON`T YOU HAVE INTERNET?????"
BAoV8lrAy88,"Lying is legal. Lying for profit is fraud, and is illegal. Democrats could have stopped Fox’s lies decades ago, but has done…nothing."
BAoV8lrAy88,"""I love the poorly educated.""
It worked, in conjunction with Fox Entertainment..., RFKjr and Elon.  A dystopian terrible nightmare..."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Why? Because With internet technology, you have access to get the information. But people just lazy and don’t use their brain to think. Too much right and too much left are not good. We are proved that we unbalanced. That’s why over half of our county,  people choose to be stupid today. That’s how elected this garbage"
BAoV8lrAy88,I wonder what 65 million homeless senior citizens will look like......I will be one of them.....Elon Musk was brought on board to kill Social Security and Medicare......these people voted to kill themselves....
BAoV8lrAy88,"Strongest economy is that a joke... unless you like high inflation, high taxes, low pay  but yeah you do you"
BAoV8lrAy88,Their Macdonalds prices went up = economy bad!! Anyway yes I can confirm the Murdochs have ruined Australia. Our politics are just as f@cked
BAoV8lrAy88,"Just a tip to all u MEDIA 😮 u a lian do dontcha , and your MOMMA dont want ya.  TRUMP 2024 AMEN"
BAoV8lrAy88,"After the last few years,  I don't think anyone had to be tricked...."
BAoV8lrAy88,Trump will destroy the economy. The irony.
BAoV8lrAy88,You seriously have an ego problem.
BAoV8lrAy88,Truer words have never been spoken
BAoV8lrAy88,"While the billionaires exploit our country, Fox will blame the left and immigrants."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Oh lord, you're utter lack of self awareness is remarkable in itself, but the baseless claims that anyone was tricked is pathetic if not sadly laughable.  Faith has been restored.  Not only was the democrat candidate for president rebuked for incompetence, but also the senate flipped and house strengthened.  This was an American mandate that ya'all lost the plot and the bliss youve enjoyed has been replaced by pragmatism."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Thomas, nobody was tricked.  They went on their own reality.  Greatest economy?  Sure, it's great for you.  Reading your papers like some kind of father figure with hard bounds on the shelf behind you.  Not so great for seventy million Americans.  Who exactly do you suggest they talk to about that?  What is in those hard bounds that actually helps them?"
BAoV8lrAy88,"No there's no trick Obama and Biden just ignored FOX and let them break our laws and spread vicious false information.  I personally sent them over 11000 tweets, texts, and you tube.  Democrats are weak, incompetent and cowardly."
BAoV8lrAy88,It not just lies from news. It’s been a corporate takeover of America. Companies price hikes tightened cash flow of workers to put trump back in office
BAoV8lrAy88,It's not just Fox News that's responsible. It's the other mainstream media channels like CNN and CBS who are complicit in constantly hammering Democrats while letting Republicans off very lightly.
BAoV8lrAy88,The Murdochs are vermin!
BAoV8lrAy88,"It's a white man's world , I just live in it."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Please tell us what will change this? I totally agree.  I see my friends spending money on everything. Resturaunt, toys vacations.  But say they are broke.  I see roads built, jobs plentiful inflation down.  Gas under $3 I remember the Trump years way different than most of my friends.  Americans are sheep, being herded down the road.  How can we reach these people.  I think just let the chias dust Roy things. It will hurt everyone and at least for a few years eyes will be opened."
BAoV8lrAy88,The Americans weren't tricked into voting. Most of them have been brainwashed with propaganda and hate for so long they have been blinded from the truth and been given a strong delusion to believe the lies.
BAoV8lrAy88,Tricked? 😂😅😂🤣
BAoV8lrAy88,I’m starting to think that russia has something to do with this.
BAoV8lrAy88,Social media is worse than Fox News.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Freedom of speech and freedom of the Press has certainly brought  its ""special"" set of problems over the years."
BAoV8lrAy88,"Lets hope that soon, Technology will reveal how Kamala seemingly lost and what was done to give the win to Donald!"
BAoV8lrAy88,America is now officially the land of intellectual and moral misfits.
BAoV8lrAy88,"Thom you call it out correctly!  Thank goodness you always stand up for justice for the American people!
YOU AND THE ONLINE News influences are the Main Media!!
Many people don't listen to their Middle of the road reporting.
So happy you know the real deal and share with the online community❤"
UYqYBZHozjY,Goooooooo Trump and Elon

UYqYBZHozjY,"I read this and before even seeing ur name I knew what Ur nationality was , I already know that it's ur ppl that have complete control over America 😂 And anything that would thwart ur robbery of America would be considered a problem, we already know truth so there's nothing you can add to it 😂 TRUMP ELON BOBBY 2024"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Tesla is sourcing  cobalt from the Congo using child slave labour!! 
Why isn’t anyone exposing him? 
Why is he the acting VP? Because he’s Sth African he can’t ? So Vance is a fake? Imagine Trump goes to jail President Vance Vice President Marjorie Taylor Greene😳"
UYqYBZHozjY,DemocRAT  🐀🐀🐀propaganda !
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump won!! Now what?
UYqYBZHozjY,"If the economy tanks, then 2026 midterms will be ugly for them- assuming that the Democrats get the right messaging and that we have elections to begin with."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Thank you 💎💎💎!!! I have Birch Gold ads following me on YouTube being Pitched by Trumps Son, Bitcoin speeches from Trump, and current market high has content creators encouraging the middle to grab your wealth.  Spinning 🥴 💫"
UYqYBZHozjY,"What about Tump’s plan to convert to a digital economy, can u explain that and how it will affect us"
UYqYBZHozjY,Im sorry to unform that you are describing the dnc not trump.
UYqYBZHozjY,As seen in The Simpsons back in 2000.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Paul Getty's first wildcat well in Oklahoma came in 7,000 barrels per day... that's how he got rich!"
UYqYBZHozjY,"He doesn't plan to crash the economy, he's going to crash the economy despite what he thinks. Every economist not paid for by the RNC has said so. That's why Elon Musk warned people about the tough times coming. Even that idiot knows."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Crash the economy as he did in his first term ?
Ahhh"
UYqYBZHozjY,I am sure that most of the 1% support demonrats.
UYqYBZHozjY,Put on your seatbelt everyone this ride doesn’t have brakes  😂😂😂😂2025 trump gasoline prices will rise at $6 per gallon for the middle class
UYqYBZHozjY,"Good planning, Trump & Musk 😂😂😂"
UYqYBZHozjY,Why is he doing this ?
UYqYBZHozjY,The RAPE of AMERICA by the RICH Complete dominance
UYqYBZHozjY,Con man at work.😅😅😅
UYqYBZHozjY,Real trump supporters knows the recession isn’t coming. White trump supporters are too smart to fall for false promises.
UYqYBZHozjY,If this economy crash the rich will lose all their wealth maybe that is good for Americans. To restart without all the evilness people leader in USA. Crash crash!!
UYqYBZHozjY,"Hide his money in bitcoin, and then putin or kimyung will rubb it😢"
UYqYBZHozjY,You are a moron
UYqYBZHozjY,"My ex buddy voted for trump saying,i know he was twice impeached,and he is a convicted felon and other crimes that he committed but he is going to lower grocery prices and the economy will get better...Those are the people that voted for trump.."
UYqYBZHozjY,"I never voted for either of them but the title of this video has already began and it wasn’t triggered by Trump, I will say perhaps he will save US."
UYqYBZHozjY,"How quickly thngs change, sad.  One above all laws."
UYqYBZHozjY,...let me guess...YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT!!!!
UYqYBZHozjY,"From Jan 20 2025, day by day, even current handful of middle class will be erased and in the end there are only two types of income hierarchies: super-riches and poor. No more middle class. All the poors will end up giving their money to the super riches to get them more and more richer. Those who picked trump and billionaires will still have no clue what’s going on because they never learn, they are just incapable of learning."
UYqYBZHozjY,No its already crashed he is going to tell the truth and then try to get it back the right way
UYqYBZHozjY,"djt is an idiot 
djt knows 
But he is idiot"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Trump will save the u s,"
UYqYBZHozjY,Give it a rest. Same ols song. Same old so called experts.
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump should wear an orange prison outfit to match his color😂
UYqYBZHozjY,I never had a poor man sign my paycheck.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Why in the world would you all believe that Trump and Musk are going to intentionally trash the economy? It’s trash right now thanks to Biden and Harris. No one remembers Trumps first term? No one was complaining then. We’re involved in multiple wars right now. Who is profiting off of that? The rich. Get your story straight.

You may have not noticed but the charges against Trump are being dropped."
UYqYBZHozjY,He was soppose to cause wars too.
UYqYBZHozjY,Maga = 🐑🐑🐑🐑
UYqYBZHozjY,"What should we do now? Republicans have all 3 branches of government, Kennedy is going to be in charge of health, musk, in charge of finance… etc

Do we try and payoff as much as we can before inauguration? Buy some stocks when it drops even if it means not paying a utility bill? 
I just don’t want to lose my home and be able to help my family."
UYqYBZHozjY,THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM JUST CHARGES YOU
UYqYBZHozjY,This video will age like milk in the sun.
UYqYBZHozjY,Prior to 2007 it was the easiest time in history to buy a home..I bought with no job…held on through the recession….a modest home…now I have to rent rooms to keep it
UYqYBZHozjY,"This is why we have the huge problem of homelessness…..the rich raking in profits from buying foreclosed properties during the last big recession……jacking rents on apartments, temporary rentals."
UYqYBZHozjY,It’s not criminal to buy stocks when the market goes down.  Spend less than what you earn…save for hard times.  Most don’t want to however.
UYqYBZHozjY,"401k's are a gamble for the working class. You could make some money if you're lucky, but you could lose your ass if you're not! It was a way for businesses to pretend to provide you with a retirement plan and hope that you took a hefty loss before you retired!"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Save your money, don’t do Black Friday, don’t buy a bunch of gifts. Don’t give your money to the corporations who own us."
UYqYBZHozjY,"People tend to be hand to mouth and spend like crazy when times are good. Then loss it when things get bad. The smart ones save during during good times and are not effected during bad times. He was convicted in New York, i thought they were soft on criminals and had no bail. Did FOX lie to me. A serial ,habitual felon is out on the streets.  34 felony counts, max 4 years per count. So much on being a law and order guy. Justice for thy but not for me? Crazy times."
UYqYBZHozjY,Too late the billionaire demo rats already crashed it. Demo rats are rich too never forget
UYqYBZHozjY,Republican voters are doomed!!! Again.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Because of the 2007 crash, GWB is considered one of the worst Presidents in US history."
UYqYBZHozjY,"When the greed of the wealthy exceeds what the people are willing to accept, the people will turn on them and seek revenge. The USA is already close to that point, and it won't take much to push them over the edge. When the richest man on earth conspires with a President elect to ruin the lives of the people, all hell will break lose."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Yeah the USA is all ready in a huge debt because of the Ukraine war now Trump wants to spend more money on the war in the Middle East lol and then what about China, I doubt that Putin will help Trump with that war lol and Putin is fighting for Iran and Trump for Israel all I can say is Donald Trump the Humpty Dumpty sat high on his wall and he had a great fall. And all the kings men could not put Donald Trump the Humpty Dumpty back together again"
UYqYBZHozjY,That's a big lie!
UYqYBZHozjY,I’m from the future and they’re getting away with it
UYqYBZHozjY,All institutions belong to Democrats from EPA to the state controllers and the federal housing administration and the workers unions and the CIA and FBI
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump will dump the economy!
UYqYBZHozjY,Typical lies by liberals
UYqYBZHozjY,I think what  you're saying is that on Jan 2nd 2025 I should sell at least half my 401K etc and just wait for the crash to snatch up the deals.
UYqYBZHozjY,"The Chinese thought Elon a valuable lesson forcing him to  discount his inferior EV to the Chinese EV.  Now, Elon is using Trump to get back at the Chinese."
UYqYBZHozjY,"And don't forget, Trump is going to send all of the black people to Minnesota.  He will send half the people of Porto-rico to Minnesota as well.  Don't let him do that.  Wait, he has already won.  Well, just hope you are a millionaire white person so you can be safe.  Like Bernie."
UYqYBZHozjY,"You could have said this 3.5 years ago. But noooo….because you thought Kamala is going to win. This is just another scare tactic you guys are doing. Keep it up….

Also these so call economy expert….😀😀😀."
UYqYBZHozjY,"You’re stupid, the recession was already set to happen based on the Biden administration’s decisions through their term."
UYqYBZHozjY,I agree...I'm pissed..I'm a convicted rapist illegal alien and I wanted my free sex change operation..boo hoo I'm so sad I can't listen to this dribble anymore !!!
UYqYBZHozjY,The VP crashed her campaign.😊
UYqYBZHozjY,"Engineer a recession?  Republicanns crash the economy every single time...naturally, without even trying!"
UYqYBZHozjY,"That’s what happens when you vote for @A Scumbag Rapist  Con Man.  WAKE UP AMERICAN GOP ,
Wtf"
UYqYBZHozjY,Now what? trump won! The judge is considering dropping the case.😳
UYqYBZHozjY,"We're already in it Thomm,what in the world🤔"
UYqYBZHozjY,"It's not just billionaires' interest.  Crashing the US Economy will save putin and allow the New Axis to continue the war.
Most of our billionaires are also not that smart. Just vicious and greedy. Their  billions can be worthless and they'd rather have piles of worthless paper than be a strong dollar millionaire
They're also dumb enough to  think they can buy clean water, clean air or just move to 'nice' countries with strong social structures they haven't destroyed.
Wealth is not merit based in our modern world."
UYqYBZHozjY,It is what he does best. We know it’s not rain but his cult member will bathe in his golden showers
UYqYBZHozjY,"Hartmann, you are a sick A-hole!!!!"
UYqYBZHozjY,Im sure trump will be dead in few years. Hes not getting younger or healthier and his mind is checking out fast.
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump will default on the national debt and try to renegotiate. This is going to be worse than the Great Depression.  I can see the House holding up the upcoming budget vote in December and let everything rot away until next year.
UYqYBZHozjY,U.S.economy.going.back.to.mass.unemployement.again.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Dear USA: Your very long election period is over, and I do NOT need thousands of predictions from every American with a camera and a microphone. I am suggesting a little break from USA being ""The Center Of The Universe"" and moving on to that final end of USA joining the Rest Of Us. Any peace negotiations need USA to abandon the regular violence against the endless enemies of buying your freedom with saturated credit cards of debt. USA is bankrupt, the begging will start soon, the Rest Of Planet Earth has climate disasters, too (Spain badly flooded like USA from Helene, we are all in the same sinking boat, many drought stricken areas busting the global food supply). Let's consider that everyone on the planet deserves a good life."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Id like him to privatize super, reduce benefits by %27/29 ...for the .... privilege ..😢.."
UYqYBZHozjY,"This didn't age well. trump won .America lost no jail, no fines, nothing as always. Warren Buffet has pulled his money to safe havens away from the stock market"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Mr. Hartmann is making up more stuff and still trying to make progressive socialism look like a viable pipe dream. So sad. 
What's his claim to fame? The #1 Progressive radio talking head? The best at being the worst?"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Well, he didn't lose."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Republicans crash the economy (Bush/Bush/Trump). Democrats build it back (Clinton/Obama/Biden). The obvious pattern is that Trump will crash this economy. The question is, will there be an election that allows a Democrat to fix it again?"
UYqYBZHozjY,What do the rich people buy if all the workers are jobless and homeless? If the economy crashes there will only be products imported from china and mexico available to buy! Lol
UYqYBZHozjY,Billionaires will know in advance when we will go bust and see it as an opportunity to make even more money. They have back up most of us know little or nothing about.
UYqYBZHozjY,"""The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."" - Baron Rothschild"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Great idea--- if your kids are selfish, show no respect for you and are maga, leave your inheritance to the Democrat Party !! 😊 I'M SERIOUS !!! They will need a lot of money to come back !!!"
UYqYBZHozjY,Its so obvious its sicking!
UYqYBZHozjY,Warren buffet’s ready with cash on hand to buy everyone’s panic sales if stocks and assets
UYqYBZHozjY,"huh, but yet Trump increased the debt TREMENDOUSLY during his first 4 years.  1/2 of USA voters are blindly ignorant.  Sigh"
UYqYBZHozjY,The democrats wanted to close down the economy during covid don't blame it on trump sir.
UYqYBZHozjY,"This is the pattern that no republican can seem to recognize. The last two gop presidents have handed their successors an economy on its face, then the next gop hack gets to inherit an economy repaired by Democrat policies. Cycle repeats."
UYqYBZHozjY,"This is why we need a new type of economic system, one that restricts unlimited wealth and takes into account human health and ecological degradation.  RFKjr has made Trump aware of these things and Trump is thinking about it - his only push back has been on drilling saying to RFK  ""please don't try to make me stop drilling"" .   

The average person needs to understand this economic necessity, the rich will never do this on their own."
UYqYBZHozjY,"In a depression the rich have everything and want for nothing, while everyone else suffers or dies"
UYqYBZHozjY,Then the people voted for him will suffer.  Im not learn about the ones in a positions to weather it.  Im talking every sole who voted for him
UYqYBZHozjY,Good
UYqYBZHozjY,"They don't have to trash the economy, it's already on it's way there...giving away all the money."
UYqYBZHozjY,What BS
UYqYBZHozjY,"""its going to be the most beautiful recession the world has ever seen, i love big beautiful recessions, im a billionaire its what i do"""
UYqYBZHozjY,"So Elon is a terrorist, financial terrorist. And idol."
UYqYBZHozjY,It's going to get worse
UYqYBZHozjY,Yeah but not to worry the wealth you get that big old massive tax break and they'll be just fine
UYqYBZHozjY,"It is the endgame, the USA gets bankrupt, the World steps over from fossil fuels to electricity, the more you drill the more you have to use it in the USA. Products will be expensive with tariffs. It is the end. Trump is the President you deserve."
UYqYBZHozjY,"We cannot  produce & pay for subdized folks, so the taxes have to go down, and cutting spending is tge only solid way to do that vs. Counterfeiting currency"
UYqYBZHozjY,Why are you  so  evil
UYqYBZHozjY,And don’t forget half price car insurance if you guys believe that I got some property in Arizona to sell you
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump voters will get what’s coming to them and we’re there for the ride. They’ll never see dollar 50 gas. They’ll never see cheap groceries. These people even think that their rents gonna get lowered because of their house payments are getting lowered and that is the best one I’ve ever heard.
UYqYBZHozjY,"MIRACULOUSLY, TRUMP WILL NOW PAY OFF ALL DEBTS USING AMERICA AS HIS PRIVATE ""ATM""!!!"
UYqYBZHozjY,And let the chips fall where they do..........this is what the MAGA cult wanted!!!
UYqYBZHozjY,Project 25😮😮😮😮
UYqYBZHozjY,"When shit is about to hit the fan , you dont care if its Red or Blue. Most likely Violet."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Stupid is as Stupid does  Keep your eye on the poorer states, W Virginia,  Kentucky, Tennessee, they will be the first to be bled dry. Easy targets who supported the rights of the Felon.  RESEARCH should have been your best friend instead you believed a LIAR?"
UYqYBZHozjY,Crime pays! We voted to be a criminal enterprise so now go do crime! Lie cheat and steal like a billionaire! There are no rules! Trump!
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump said he’s deporting immigrants with green cards as well does that mean Elon musk and trumps wife gonna be on that bus ride to the border as well?!
UYqYBZHozjY,Are you a democrat opp
UYqYBZHozjY,Musk is the true enemy of the people.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Corporations are sitting in their board rooms planning their response to tariffs.  There is no way 20-60% tariffs will not result in higher costs.  The responses will include layoffs, reduced R&D , etc.   I am sitting in my couch thinking of things to buy before the tariffs hit."
UYqYBZHozjY,Buy low sell high. The secret to making money in the stock market. Unfortunately most Americans sell low and buy high
UYqYBZHozjY,Elon Musk is a megalomaniac on par with Trump. He's out to feed his own god- complex and has absolutely no place in American politics.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Thank you, America for all the misery you caused and also for your wars in the middle east. In Europe we are dealing with the consequences: giving shelter to the refugees."
UYqYBZHozjY,And Project 2025 is heavily involved.  Elon has an agenda. And created a huge amount of propaganda. And Trump wanted to stay out of prison.
UYqYBZHozjY,Can't keep printing endless amounts of money. And not expect any consequences for it. And it's kinda weird. The richest people in the u.s. Donate to the democratic party.
UYqYBZHozjY,"YES!!...EVERY damn RECESSION has HUGLY WIDENED the GAP between RICH & POOR!...American's that VOTED for this shit-show will find out in good time, that THEY are NOT DUMPF'S best friends!! ....this has happened SO regularly! OLIGARCHS....Welcome to MOSCOW on the POTOMAC!"
UYqYBZHozjY,"if you can kill a fetus for economic gains, you can murder anything for any reason -  Cumallah"
UYqYBZHozjY,Hitler loved abortion.
UYqYBZHozjY,Wouldn't it be funny if someone drained their bank accounts.
UYqYBZHozjY,It should be   JESUS and trump  not trump and elon😂😂😂😂gave an apple but takes the whole garden🎉🎉🎉
UYqYBZHozjY,Sorry tom the trump evil...won!!😢
UYqYBZHozjY,"IF EVER AMERICA IS TO GO THROUGH A RECESSION, IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF TRUMP, HE AIN'T PRESIDENT YET... JUST REMEMBER WHO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT /VP. 😮😮😮😮😮"
UYqYBZHozjY,Don’t forget that crime goes up during a recession
UYqYBZHozjY,"Vintage motorcycle values have been dropping quickly all around the world. The rumor in the vintage bike business is that a world-wide economic crisis is coming soon. It may be like the return of 1932 again. Trump will be blamed for this disaster, but it seems to be global and even if Harris had won, the new depression would still be on us."
UYqYBZHozjY,😢😢😢🤪😂😂😂😂
UYqYBZHozjY,"Hope you Trumpers are ready for the reaming your King is going to bestow on you. With Trump's tariffs you won't be able to buy lube.....
ENJOY"
UYqYBZHozjY,Will someone out there please share this video this video is about rich people getting richer in a recession in the rest of the American people suffer
UYqYBZHozjY,"Fine. lets deport migrants, but can we start with Elon? jfc."
UYqYBZHozjY,Let them. Americans voted for it. I don’t care anymore.
UYqYBZHozjY,You just told us what the Democrats are planning! Thank you! We will keep an eye out for it.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Those who learn the lessons of history are condemned to look on, powerless, as the muppets repeat it."""
UYqYBZHozjY,"Do Democrats ever get tired of lying? How do people become as morally bankrupt as ""progressives""?"
UYqYBZHozjY,More lies and propaganda.
UYqYBZHozjY,Tom Hartmann and the Dems didn't get it. Borrowing a $Trillion every 90 days to prop up the economy is inflationary and is no way to run a railroad . . . or the country . . .
UYqYBZHozjY,The money doesn't disappear the rich people take it
UYqYBZHozjY,"TAXING unrealized gains like Harris wanted to wouldn’t incentivize billionaires to sell off stocks, bonds, and properties, which would more than likely cause a stock market crash similar to that of the Covid crash in 2020 yet you’re saying the Republican party based on his policies wants to crash the stock market yet right now the stock market is nearing all time highs this is why you lost the unreal absurdity of the left has caused its indefinite demise. God bless America."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Americans have a ""Robin Hood in reverse government"" = rob the poor to pay the rich."
UYqYBZHozjY,"This guy is pretty dishonest, why do you think stocks had their biggest crash in 2020.."
UYqYBZHozjY,"No recession coming. Tax cuts, world peace and lower gas prices along with AI will keep the economy strong while simultaneously shrinking government spending and using tariffs. Everything will balance out."
UYqYBZHozjY,It brings prices down. Even the fed does it on purpose. It was scheduled to crash anyway. Yea anyone who invests will makes money off down markets. Recessions are healthy
UYqYBZHozjY,The rich gets to pick the bones clean
UYqYBZHozjY,"Buy low, sell high. That is great for people with enough cash sitting around to take advantage of market cycles."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Well, is it True that Tariffs either Caused or aggravated, Depression?

2008 the Stocks fell down in the 5000s, even with CitiBank. Now?
Somewhere in the upper 30,000..."
UYqYBZHozjY,Fake news!!!!
UYqYBZHozjY,You have to be a complete idiot if you believe this guy
UYqYBZHozjY,You're all just looking for an excuse for your miserable unhappy existence .... Trumps victory will suffice for a while .
UYqYBZHozjY,"Also, with Depression comes DV, Fraud, Homelessness, Chaos, Hate Crimes, Divorce, all the good things MAGA love."
UYqYBZHozjY,"How else will Trump get the millions for unemployed struggling people to “enlist ” (read conscript) for the coming WW3, Cannon fodder doesn’t just make itself. 😢"
UYqYBZHozjY,First two years will be paradise bit the next two 😫😫😫😫
UYqYBZHozjY,"You are an absolute toad for doing this. This is the biggest bunch of BS ive ever seen. The economy was tanking long before any election. Remember the revision of jobs over and over? The absolute only reason it hasnt collapsed yet is because of the money being dumped into ""ukraine"" and the fed buying treasuries. China is collapsing. Europe is collapsing. Everything is leveraged 1000% or more. The entire time potato head has been in office, theyve been destroying the economy and banking system. They forced banks to hold long term bonds and then raised rates which lowered the bonds value. Causing banks to technically be insolvent. This is all done on purpose well before trump"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Thom, a recession is what America needs now.  That's how inflation and home prices will reset or fall."
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump will declare the United States bankrupt and  erase the national debt a d brag about it.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Hey morons he improved the economy 4 years ago , remember? And he'll do it even better this time round. You all truly do have TRUMP derangement syndrome."
UYqYBZHozjY,Will it be as bad as Biden’s recession?
UYqYBZHozjY,I didn't vote for either. I haven't for years. Neither side is concerned with everyday people.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Farmers overwhelmingly voted for trump.  Due to trump's tariff, the farmers will lose their markets and prices will drop.  When they go bankrupt, the billionaires will buy their land, and we will end up with corporation farms.  This will kill small towns, because corporate farms do not buy locally."
UYqYBZHozjY,We will now pay taxes like Trump.
UYqYBZHozjY,This man is wrong  if the govt takes less money from us   We will have it spend as we want which will help with current prices.  Remember this idiot he will be wrong.
UYqYBZHozjY,"Well, Donald Trump did say he was going to be the golden age of America for him and Elon Musk and all all the other rich people"
UYqYBZHozjY,Ten of the last eleven recessions happened under Republicans
UYqYBZHozjY,Maybe a big crash will wake people up. Americans are spoiled and selfish. These fools think tRump will make them money.
UYqYBZHozjY,The Biden infrastructure money runs out in 2026.  110 billion out of the economy.  A 20% tariff will result in Europe and South East Asia not buying Us exports. Farmer's will get hurt first.  As imports go down so does the logistics industry. 17 million health care workers will see lower wages if Trump cuts health care funding.  I am predicting a recession in 2027.
UYqYBZHozjY,Just a bunch of Donald Trump syndrome
UYqYBZHozjY,"Ford's prolonged recession really cast a spotlight on the ability of the wealthy to withstand a financial downturn and purchase, at deeply discounted prices, the assets of people who couldn't easily withstand that financial downturn.  The Republican donor class sees recessions as opportunities, not hardships, so Republican politicians have no incentive to manage the economy for the benefit of the country.  Their incompetence, or deliberate sabotage, benefits their donors."
UYqYBZHozjY,A recession may come as a result of the present administration's failures. Trump would ease it up. Don't ore-assign blame to him. It's unconsciounable..
UYqYBZHozjY,Excellent commentary!
UYqYBZHozjY,I personally believe there will be a recession but not for his reasons. The Biden administration no matter what they tell Trump about how smooth the transition is going to be I believe they are working behind the scenes to crash the economy. If I'm right the crash for the car to 2 months after Trump takes office if he's right and Trump causes it it will occur sometime near the end of the year
UYqYBZHozjY,"It is true that elections have consequences. Be careful what you wish for. The only people who will see a raise in income are top 1%. In the end, you will find that did this to yourselves."
UYqYBZHozjY,Ummmm… aren’t we in a recession now??? Aren’t we in the middle of wars now??
UYqYBZHozjY,Biden should deport musk!
UYqYBZHozjY,Trump won and now you can leave. Won by a landslide!!!! So who's wrong?
UYqYBZHozjY,"Thom, are you eating crow? 😅😅😂"
UYqYBZHozjY,"Yep... during a recession, people with money get to buy up property and raise prices when the recession ends."
UYqYBZHozjY,IF THE GRIFTER TRUMP TRIES ANY SCAM TREASON ACTS HE MAY END UP SAME AS WHAT HAPPENED TO JFK...FATE IS COMING😮😮
UYqYBZHozjY,"Nope. Trump is gonna walk and he will be very Vindictive.

Next 4yrs will be very interesting"
UYqYBZHozjY,U give hypothetical and examples no real facts
UYqYBZHozjY,Blah blah blah
UYqYBZHozjY,"sore losers folks, you will all do just fine and probably much better than you would ever admit. Get over it and back to work, the economy will do fine"
UYqYBZHozjY,Fake
UYqYBZHozjY,"Like a certain 1930's german dictator.
He will blame our soon economic woes on marginalized group(s) to shift blame off of him during his presidency.
I feel bad for whoever those may be."
UYqYBZHozjY,Government spending will provide stimulus when economic growth slows down but reduction in government spending will not crash an economy
UYqYBZHozjY,Every time a republican has been in office they always have a recession that is a fact
UYqYBZHozjY,You got everything wrong. So does that mean you talk shite. 😅🤣😂😝
UYqYBZHozjY,You are the problem
UYqYBZHozjY,Satan chose Trump for Presidency but God allowed it to happen for his Bible prophecy to happen. God allows every evil and good thing to happen 🙏🏾. Evil doings is of Satan but God allows it to happen. Every good thing that happens to God allows it to happen as well for his good. Trump's winning office was of Satan not God.
UYqYBZHozjY,He can’t even do his own finance bankruptcy fines
UYqYBZHozjY,Setting up the mark of the beast
UYqYBZHozjY,"Funny you say Fortune 500 companies when black Rock Diversity equity Inclusion founder invests mostly in the Fortune 500 companies plus under Biden they were put on the Chinese stock market buying up their AI software company stocks that grades social credit score that bans people from getting jobs, traveling by train, plane, leaving the country, is also Kamala Harris's biggest donor. Kamala spent $1billion paying for celebrities to show up at her concerts like Beyoncé, Jay Z and other P Diddy celebrities worried about getting arrested."
UYqYBZHozjY,I have never voted the federal government central government is the infiltration occupation of the American the name USA
UYqYBZHozjY,You and the media lie all the time. Just look at what the media actually said vs what Trump said.
UYqYBZHozjY,"The housing market crash was caused by Clinton/bush/obama, Obama bailed out the big banks, and let them get bigger, 51 military industrial complex down to 5. Medicare part D pushed by Clinton, and Bush, that made it illegal for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, but couldn't charge more than customers. So insulin, hiv medication pill that cost .12cents/pill, and went up to $750/pill from $1.50. Insulin and most prescriptions skyrocketed. Obama passed Obama care he claimed was based on Newt Gingrich's healthcare plan, was to allow all health insurance companies to sell plans in every state, every has to buy it, small companies could buy plans with other companies to lower the rates, and government would help pay the plans for people who couldn't afford it. Black Rock CEO George Soros, came up with the 2008 housing market bank bailout plans, Black Rock, Van Guard, Fidelity went from $1trillion to $10trillion. CNN, MSNBC u know bill gates Micro Soft NBC, supported this. Trump got rid of the Republican establishment like Liz Cheney,  fired Chris Christie, who work with democrats who play the race card, pushing for Disinformation, Misinformation, Hate Speech laws like in UK where over 10,000 people have been arrested for things like the Preacher who said, Jesus loves gay people as homophobic speech,posting rap songs as racist, posting Bible verses, Germany who arrested a woman for bullying 11 men who got no jail time for gang raping a girl, and this guy? Just pull up the video about Liz Cheney Trump comment. He said, war mongers like Liz Cheney who want war, wouldn't support so many wars if she had to stand before a firing squad. Russia invaded Ukraine under Obama, Obama/ Biden, Biden/Kamala gave Iran $200billion under both administration not to support terrorism, which, under Obama they started Syrian Civil war, Biden Pulled out of Afghanistan, leaving $100billion worth of weapons, October 7, Russia invaded Ukraine again, Had Homeland Security create an app to encourage illegal, political Asylum seeking people from Haiti, El Salvador, then called people racist bc towns with 10,000 people had 2,000 people sent, Springfield Ohio get 20,000-30,000 people, in town with 55,000, Hilltop Columbus Ohio house on S Oakley next to the house with the shooting, Google it(blue tarp) rent went from $675/month to $1,700, they are increasing it to $1,900, bc Black Stone, private equity, the top 3 public inequity firms in 2008, Black Rock DEI creator, Van Guard ESG creator, Fidelity went from $1trillion in 2008 to $10trillion in 2008, by 2015 they controlled over 90% of the Fortune 500 companies, after Covid, $30trillion, largest shareholder in each other,  the military industrial complex went from 51 companies to 5, Amazon was able to get Kmart who filed bankruptcy then bought Sears, bankrupted both so Jeff Bezo's Amazon could buy up all their distribution centers, by using private equity firms, public equity firms, to short their stocks, buy the company for 10% of the value, then rack the value back up, max out its debt, and sell all the assets for Pennie's for the dollar, and doing this over and over, to push socialism, like Nazi Germany, communism, u know where the people own the means of the production, or the big business gets in bed with politician/government like Nazi Germany. They control every auto manufacturing, energy company, in Western Europe, America, Japan, S Korea, but you know liberals are mad the Washington Post wouldn't endorse Kamala, bc Jeff Bezo knew Kamala would lose, do to cheating wouldn't work despite she some how caught up to Trump who was down 12million votes, but mail n ballots brought it down to less than 4million votes. They let 13million illegal voters in so they could change the census to get more seats in Congress. Just watch what they say, edited clips of Trump, vs like Jan 6 Trump full speech vs what MSNBC said. Watch the Senate Hearings of Dr Fauci, NiH 200+ scientists have spit over $710million, watch the Senate with ATF Director, DHS Secretary, FBI Director corruption, watch the senate hearings on pro abortion doctor, nurses, vs anti abortion doctors on 9 month abortion, 20-26month late term abortion. Why would they refuse to say they wouldn't be against abortions at 9months on healthy fetuses, mothers, no rape, no incest, bc she changes her mind? Watch Tim Waltz Fox interview on abortion about his abortion law. He doesn't deny he passed a law allowing abortion until 9months for no reason. Dr Fauci emails, tape recordings showing they lied about Covid, knowing Covid was engineered in a lab, and being concerned bc he funded Wu Han lab. 3days after email he went on tv and said, if you call it Wu Han Virus, your racist, and suddenly black men/white homeless men were being filmed hitting old Asian men and women. Pull up the full videos on YouTube. Then go back and watch everytime the media says trump says something, without showing him say it. If yo watch. The videos you will know they lied."
UYqYBZHozjY,"Yep, because that’s what you do if want your party to continue to run the country after your term. Geeeez, you people are dense. 
And people lost their homes because legislation that was passed that made these lenders lend to people who couldn’t have afforded a house in the first place."
UYqYBZHozjY,"It is UN plans which are already destroying the economy. De-industrializing, the zer-carbon poli😮😮cies are 2 of the  problems.  The World Economic Forum are behind the UN and the new policies."

p3S0_o-Vfg0,Take fox off the air immediately!
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"Believe me, what Trump proposes for Republican Liz Cheney and so many others will apply to anyone they (down through his lowest minions) want to hurt for any reason. In the early 1960s I was stationed close to Dachau and talked with a lot of the elderly German people that had seen the rise of Hitler (whom Trump is a not so bright copy of). Several of them had worked at Dachau. I as a dumb 18-year-old once asked, ""Why did you work at the concentration camp?"" The answer was plain, even as a German you had a choice of working there or being in it. Trump & his cohort traitors would soon be doing even more horrible things to Americans, and soon eating their own believers --- already Liz Cheney. Half of those in the camps weren't Jewish but anyone they wanted to put in it. No person with any morals, be they atheist, Jewish to devoted Christian, could morally vote for any MAGA Republican again this cycle."

Donald Trump America's Fiest Dictator President. GOD HELP US ALL IF TRUNP CHESTS HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE HE IS GOING TO TRY ANOTHER COUP IF HE LOSES,  AND THIS TIME HE MAY SUCCEED…"
p3S0_o-Vfg0,And now you all know why the people should be allowed to own AR’s and other weapons of that nature.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"Hey Thomas the video dips at 3:00 I've noticed this quite a few times in your videos & it impedes understanding what you're saying, i highly recommend finding somebody that can pinpoint the problem"
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"White privilege 
Male privilege 
Christian privilege"
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"Trump has nothing to lose, at 78 he won't be around long, so revenge and chaos are what he wants.  Trump will not be able to leave a good legacy, so he will go all out to try to show himself as a ""strong leader"" but decimating the USA, its social net, plus every one or institution which has ever opposed him.  May God help the USA."
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"Worse than trump is the billionaires like musk
I listened to a DOJ attorney say ""Elon is already to powerful for any regulatory body""
Wake up people the war is against billionaires like Musk and Rupert Murdoch
They hate democracy and people of color!"
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"The mind of a Liberalized Socialistic Democrat 
 Wow. Finally has been diagnosed as a medical condition that is a form of dementia with no known cure or even remedy to temporarily assist the struggling.

Just what America did not need after surviving Covid. Another disease."
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"Final hour, on the contrary this is America's finest hour!! Where its people send a clear message ""No! I will not let some weirdo billionaire buy our democracy and our nation"" and women send the message ""NO! No I shall not let my nation and my body be ruled by an old man who believes he can grab me by my pussy!!"""
p3S0_o-Vfg0,Hear me America HELL IS A STATE OF CONDITION. Under the dictatorship of Trump our lives will be HELL😢 Until the messiah returns.😊
p3S0_o-Vfg0,Who are you quoting Thom?  Your videos are still breaking up.  Never used to.  Is someone up to no good?
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"He doesn't believe even in freedom of speech, planning to arrest even the comedians.  Very deeply disturbed and unAmerican."
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"Liberty, once taken for granted, becomes a ghost in the halls of power; without vigilance, it slips quietly into the shadows. 😥"
p3S0_o-Vfg0,It is time for Americans to admit that MAGA is a terrorist group that wants to end democracy.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"I have little doubt that if Trump returns extra judicial arrests, imprisonments and killings will occur. And not only for political reasons."
p3S0_o-Vfg0,Nope. This is the end of his civil liberties.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,Trump can say what he wants from a jail cell. His legacy.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"Trump's health, both mental and physical, is obviously failing
If he wins the Presidency, it will surely pass to JD Vance
If JD Vance becomes President, women of the US will surely loose all
of their hard fought for rights including the right to VOTE.
Vote blue down the ballot
Your LIFE and those you love may well depend on it!

Donate if you can, it will be well worth it!

Even Republicans are supporting Harris/Walz NOW!

Let's make it 100 million this time, maybe the MAGAts will finally 
understand the are NOT wanted by Americans in government!"
p3S0_o-Vfg0,It is amazing that Christian Nationalists bond with Domestic Terrorists.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"You are heavily into the Kool aid 
Tone down the violent rhetoric"
p3S0_o-Vfg0,I still find it so hard to believe that People are willing to throw everything away for this moron.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,It’s just inconceivable that any American would vote for this monster - but here we are!?
p3S0_o-Vfg0,Trump may well start a civil war.   I'm amazed Trump's treasons and felonies haven't disqualified him.   Young people of means would be wise to get out of the USA for a better life elsewhere.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,All this from one of the biggest SINNERS EVER. This CAMEL wouldn't fit through a needle 10 feet tall
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"When all you know is privilege, equality seems like oppression."
p3S0_o-Vfg0,Civil liberties.  We have been able to complain about and disagree with every president of the U.S.  Now we have a presidential candidate who calls people that disagree with him enemies within.  He is vowing retribution.  There will be an assault on the right to disagree with a President Trump.
p3S0_o-Vfg0,"I don’t exactly get the fear here. Some of these people conflate having babies of nonwhite origin with one white partner with murder. Almost like they just think the problem is white skin or culture needs to exist perpetually.

Do these people need to be reminded that agi is a thing because of the technological singularity. If they are worried we will not be white as a race I wonder what their thoughts on transhumanism after the so much technological revolution alows us to start charging ourselves to the point we will no longer count as human. Lol. They aren’t only dealing with reality on it on terms.

The terms of the reality the should be dealing with is two or three times out of date."
QdGXMaYKRik,When the two parties give you a choice between a shit sandwich and diarrhea smoothy you know you're screwed either way.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Yeah if I was Peter, I'd be leaving the country for awhile to after his absolutely DISASTER of a prediction about trump losing the election by a land slide. 😂😂😂 

Remind me again Peter.... why the hell would anyone ever give credibility to your future predictions about anything again for the rest of your life? At this point you couldn't reliably predict whether or not you'll remember your own name tomorrow morning.  Loser. 👆"
QdGXMaYKRik,You're about as right as a Tarot card reader ... but just as likeable with a whole lot more Knoledge on the politics of the world. I'm older now and You're kinda not aligned. Sorta ? But you're also in my age group so I look forward to my brief time listening to you spin you're tale:-)
QdGXMaYKRik,Peak Zeihan has passed....
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter, be honest. Biden was senile and the democrats and media covered it up. Once the debate exposed his position, Harris was ""selected"" and failed to articulate ANY policy. Theories that Biden/Harris was nothing more than a marionette show courtesy of Barack Obama may yet be proven correct. The democrats ate their own with ""woke"" and ""transgender"" policies that are WILDLY unpopular Combine those with massive influx of illegal immigrants and it's no surprise that President Trump won.
Now, do me a favor and do a video on how President Trump's protectionist policies and tariffs are going to COMPLETELY EVISCERATE the economy of the West.
Please?"
QdGXMaYKRik,"It wasn’t an election, it was rigged"
QdGXMaYKRik,You forget to mention that Kamala Harris was also a Senator of CA before she was VP.
QdGXMaYKRik,"I have also noticed Trump is getting slower, I can't vote but If I could I would and yes, whoever is voting for Trump is voting for JD, but here is the deal, JD understands that his muscle for now is MAGA vote, he has to be populous if get elected twice, then he can join the Industrial Military complex."
QdGXMaYKRik,"""She's [Kamala] an empty suit"" Well put. Voted for her as CA AG .. but wasn't too much into that election and just 'checked' the box. I then worked in a CA state office that had majority issues of legal nature of with the AG office. She wasn't very well liked and not popular. Vague policies, decisions, etc. The 'empty suit' analogy is spot in and it stayed in my mind  throughout this election cycle."
QdGXMaYKRik,I think people misunderstanding that a year ago it looked like Trump would lose and this is before we all realize that Biden was basically brain dead
QdGXMaYKRik,"AlreadIy out of the country -- and if you're smart, you won't be coming back! I'd leave if I could, but an expats life squatting in a shack somewhere in Mexico is about all I could afford at 66 and subsisting on Social Security; I don't find that option particularly appealing."
QdGXMaYKRik,I used to like your commentary until you  inserted your political opinion into your pod casts. Once upon a time I regarded you as highly as Jordan Petersen. You have disappointed me. You have exposed yourself as nothing more than a Democratic shill. What a shame. I used to like you a lot!
QdGXMaYKRik,"I'll summarize. ""any of the institutional loyalties upon, which I have relied on to amass my vast fortune and clout, are weak to none.""

In other words, Peter's gonna need to start blowing much harder if he wants to maintain his status as an ""uber blowhard""😂"
QdGXMaYKRik,"Luckily Biden won, just like predicted"
QdGXMaYKRik,"I like Peter, but his hatred of Trump knows no bounds. Listening to him regarding almost (NAFTA 2 negotiations) anything that has to do with Trump is like watching blue-haired women on tiktok screaming rants."
QdGXMaYKRik,As a Canadian who is trying to understand the world. Your final comment is showing a perfect understanding of anyone whom may be around or try to get ahold of you immediately. Im already gone. Enjoy! Lol.
QdGXMaYKRik,"I can’t even imagine the horror, Peter. Trump will surrender Ukraine that happens afterwards. Terrifying. China will get advanced chips. Total idiot. Trump is a complete total idiot the scarier part of his enablers. I’m dreading the next four years. Hopefully there is at least a small chance that Europe gets its act together to save Ukraine. Otherwise, we are looking into third genocide in Ukraine in 100 years and another 2 to 3,000,000 people killed a female population, raped nukes, and Ukrainian soil. Ukraine used once again rebuild Russia I am ill I am ill at the thought of it."
QdGXMaYKRik,Trumps dementia is in full swing.
QdGXMaYKRik,"if you are aligned with russia/china/n korea, you are a traitor to your own country [unless you are from one of those countries, obv]"
QdGXMaYKRik,"Zeihan is no different than all the other eggheads that got the election wrong.
Democrats and a lot of pundits and the majority of pollsters got the election wrong because they don't understand working people.

Working people are not Woke people.
Democrats got the election wrong because they don't believe in Democracy.
If they believed in Democracy they'd know that people want to decide the abortion issue for themselves at the county level.
They'd know that alcohol, gambling, prostitution and abortion should be decided at the county level.
If they believed in Democracy they'd trust the people to decide these issues for themselves.
The politically illiterate voters are the one's who don't understand that the Democrats have imported millions of new voters and at the very least millions of new individuals in the next ""census"" to realign the congressional map."
QdGXMaYKRik,Kamala Harris was a senator.
QdGXMaYKRik,Saying JD Vance is more of an empty suit than Kamala almost makes anything you after completly irrelevant
QdGXMaYKRik,Your takes are getting further and further from reality.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Second the requests for a video post mortem, Peter.  I'm a subscriber and have been a faithful reader/listener for years.  I have been telling anyone who will listen how valuable your geopolitical insights are.
How did you get the election so wrong, and why should we trust you in future, especially on domestic issues?
You're a data guy - weren't you paying attention to the early-vote analysts on 𝕏 who nailed their predictions??"
QdGXMaYKRik,"Wow.  Wrong about everything. 
Why does anyone hire this guy for anything?
Unsubscribing."
QdGXMaYKRik,"I too assumed that Americans  would vote for what was best for themselves. But no, they voted for what was best for America's favourite conman. And the promise of cheap eggs. Essentially a flustercluck."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter, do you have a video that explains the changes in NAFTA that happened under Trump? I would like to better understand what changed."
QdGXMaYKRik,You don't get it.
QdGXMaYKRik,Such a terrible assessment.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Completely wrong about Trump. It's not about age, it's about cognition, Trump has it, Biden didn't. Trump didn't age at all in the 4 years unlike pretty much every other POTUS in our lifetime. He is a bulldog. You could have someone at 60, or 50 who is mentally deficient but Trump who will turn 80 during his term shows no signs of deterioration."
QdGXMaYKRik,"""Get him! W-wait where..."" 😂 great finish hahaha"
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter, you’re coming about Trump‘s condition is uninformed I think. The guy went 70 days without a day off. And towards the end, I’m sure he was a little scrambled. We call it being on fumes. I’m not sure you even know what that feels like, but what that man didthe endurance he showed was way beyond most people half his age. You are clueless about what you speak. Not saying you didn’t notice something. I am saying your conclusion was wrong."
QdGXMaYKRik,It would be a great injustice if Americans would get a better leader than they deserve 🇺🇲
QdGXMaYKRik,"It's not just Zeihan said Trump had no chance in the past, it's the confidence and dismissal with which that statement was made. I commented then he will eat a humble pie (as a former blue voter myself mind you..)

Makes you question what other wrong claims  he confidently makes... with no room for error whatsoever."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Oh c'mon Peter. Why do you have to be biased... Did you watch the Joe Rogan/Trump interview? Kamala couldn't hold a conversation for three hours on a podcast, which is why she refused to go on Rogan.  Trump isn't showing any sign of dementia, and this is a strategy that the never Trumpers use to try to not get him elected. It didn't work ..."
QdGXMaYKRik,Pure vapid shitlib commentary.  Not surprising for a Coloradan.
QdGXMaYKRik,Lol at this comments section. You guys are calling him our for incorrect predictions made ages ago - circumstances change and you’re no smarter at making predictions so please stop sitting on your high horses
QdGXMaYKRik,"TALK ABOUT HOS BACKWARDLY WRONG YPU WERE CHOOSING BIDEN TO WIN LOL
EVEN NORMAL EVERYDAY PEOPLE CAN SEE AND ANALYST BIDEN ISNT PHYSICALLY NOR MENTALLY FIT TO WORK ANY JOB NOT EVEN PRESIDENT 

WHY WERE U SO WRONG BC BIDEN WOULD HAVE BEEJ BEATEN EVEN WORSE"
QdGXMaYKRik,"You hit the nail on the head!!!
And for the rest of you with your crappy comments, if you're looking for a soothsayer,    right now the world is in a crazy place and the future is very unpredictable!"
QdGXMaYKRik,"lol trumps senile , are you trying to fool us or yourself, since trump won a few days ago the chaos in the world has already started to calm down and he hasnt even got power yet,its like the kids were misbehaving only to behave as soon as they hear father coming home"
QdGXMaYKRik,"You tell me the most awful predictions, but your voice is oddly comforting. Thanks, I guess."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter’s election prediction: Biden in a landslide”- 
Actual result: Trump won in a landslide.
Bitcoin prediction at $15,000 per coin: “Bitcoin will go to zero”.
Actuality: Bitcoin at $83,000. A rise of 450%.
Go away Peter you’re a waste of skin."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter, I like your presentation on this material.  On point with valid aspects to our 
Foreign policy and where we are like a ship with no ruder.  A number of comments about the election and Trump. 
If you look at key swing states the independent voters did make a last minute shift which made Trump the winner. Less people voted in this presidential election compared to 2020. 
Now the aspect of trumps mental capacity is ----
Declining and the stress of being President will accelerate this!!!  We are at a crossroads both in foreign policies and economic models. Right now just determining the right mix in factors to determine our future is frightening. Trump will not complete his term, that's not a psychic insight. That's statistical probability he will be increasing a Hindenberg of 1930!!! Voters wanted economic policies that would deal with the lost of there surviving the inflationary conditions. Trumps economic proposals on tariffs, taxation,  budget balancing and immigration policies are just bizarre. 
So his subordinates he chooses to lead specific cabinet and federal programs will be critical!!  Most likely if he pursues as he stated in the campaign we will have a major train wreck. He accelerate a trade war, higher unemployment through higher price inflation and corporate profits declining and a labor shortage due to smaller labor pools in agricultural sector and housing sectors. Illegals are critical in these two areas. I don't see any MAGA INDIVIDUALS  racing to harvest crops or meat and food processing areas !!!! 
Solution to this endless immigration issue is to process these individuals in a fashion that sets up tracking  accountability on a monthly basis. And not  this 1800s process to become a citizen in 10 years!!!! With current technology we can track individuals fairly easily with chip implants,  DNA registry and employment tracking. Anyhow, processing reforms and more staffing in immigration department also would go a long way to dealing with the issue and both parties have left this be only a talking point and not address it with valid resources. And no "" wall"" has ever worked. The great Wall in China NEVER WORKED! 
So, hold on to your "" hat"" we are in for a wild filled unpredictable mess with idiotic 
Displays of leadership in all three branches of the Federal government!!!!  
MAGA VOTERS will be the first to riot in the streets when there purchasing power of there wages shrinks!!!"
QdGXMaYKRik,The orange clown only won because the intelligent human beings refused to vote for genocide and the proxy war in Ukraine! He will continue his long history of businesses going broke by bankrupting the evil US war empire! Which is a great result for humanity!
QdGXMaYKRik,This dude is a joke
QdGXMaYKRik,"You look very regal nice beard and say big words.
Bs though nice location though."
QdGXMaYKRik,All you complainers on both sides have this wrong. Peter is a wonderful comedian.
QdGXMaYKRik,Hey Pete. Your bias is showing and now you’ve lost everyone. Good luck bud.
QdGXMaYKRik,Use to be a big Peter  fan.  But he turned out to be just a Democratic Party schill
QdGXMaYKRik,Peter has a wealth of knowledge about geopolitics around the world! As for psychically predicting the future you might as well ask Madame Zod on Main Street for the lottery numbers!🙄
QdGXMaYKRik,Mostly agree and thanks for the painful truth.  I would only add that Harris has/had a brain and was able to learn vs Vance who is a complete idiot.  Givent hat is a moot point now We are in for a real S__T show.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Yes, all these years folks like yourself assured us that Biden had the mental fortitude to be President, yet now all of a sudden Trump is too old. OK. unsubbed"
QdGXMaYKRik,Why don’t we bring Russia into the fold bring them closer to Europe and not push them into the arms of China and Iran and North Korea and why don’t we have a relationship with china but it be more of a competition relationship
QdGXMaYKRik,😂😂 the Trump derangement syndrome is real
QdGXMaYKRik,"she was a senator from California, before vice president."
QdGXMaYKRik,"peter tbh this wont age well....donald trump was doing 4 rallies a day. talking about the same topics over and over and over....it all runs together at some point. what you saw wasnt degradation, it was exhaustion. the man is 78 for gods sake. a couple days of sleeping in and fried chicken and hell be a demon again, count on it."
QdGXMaYKRik,Zeihan & democrats haven't been this depressed since slavery was abolished
QdGXMaYKRik,Yeah I agree with everyone. You make a living with predictions and you weirdos wrong how can we trust anything you say now.
QdGXMaYKRik,Trump thumped Kamala way harder than SF mayor Willie Brown
QdGXMaYKRik,"Remember from 2023, when Zeihan predicted that Trump had a ZERO chance of winning the 2024 presidential election?  So how much did the democratic party pay you to be one of their propagandists?"
QdGXMaYKRik,Came here for the leftist cope. Was not disappointed
QdGXMaYKRik,Thank you for recommending Sarah Jennine Davis  on one of your videos. I reached out to her and investing with her has been amazing.
QdGXMaYKRik,I expected more from you on this.  Your description of Trump having no useful experience is just empty.  Trump was a very successful president and has a wider base of skills than almost everyone on the planet.
QdGXMaYKRik,No one really predicted how much misinformation was going impact the election..but more so..who would realise how many gullible people there are in the US. Very sad for you all.
QdGXMaYKRik,She was a SENATOR
QdGXMaYKRik,Waiting for Peter to post a clip begging his subscribers not to leave him because of how wrong he's been. Kind of like David Pakman.
QdGXMaYKRik,Wait! You said Trump wouldn’t be elected!
QdGXMaYKRik,"When your wrong your wrong. When your talking shit in the snow, your just talking shit in the snow. Thanks Peter see you in 4yrs"
QdGXMaYKRik,I watch Peter often to get exposure to different perspectives but never forget he is ultimately a soothsayer to the powers that be…
QdGXMaYKRik,Youre gettin in the crystal.  Your lack of faith has been noted
QdGXMaYKRik,Wait...didn't you say Trump had zero chance??😅😅
QdGXMaYKRik,Educated people should not vote for the communist democrats for the last 40 years..!!
QdGXMaYKRik,"At least you were right about a landslide, just the wrong way. Oh, and don't forget your Bitcoin prediction. Yeah nah, I don't see any value in your opinions."
QdGXMaYKRik,Zeihan is good in geopolitics but is a disaster on US politics due to his pretty serious TDS
QdGXMaYKRik,this guys predictions are so full of it.
QdGXMaYKRik,You said Trump would lose. You lose a lot of credibility!
QdGXMaYKRik,The best national interest of the United States of America  - own prospective for the progress  of americans and economy of the USA.  No more wars outside of the USA and illegal  invasion or support the nazis regime such us Ukraine or Israel.
QdGXMaYKRik,confidence doesnt always equate to being right
QdGXMaYKRik,5:34 More Pure propaganda and misinformation. You are showing your true motives.
QdGXMaYKRik,"That’s not her style. She’s going to win- PZ.
3:12 She’s am empty suit
You shilled for her which makes you look Like a complete Hack."
QdGXMaYKRik,Peter might have one of the greatest downfalls of relevance over the last five years. He’s so wrong about everything. It’s hilarious. I literally watch him for entertainment now.
QdGXMaYKRik,Is that yellow snow behind him?
QdGXMaYKRik,Kamala was also a Senator so dont be so stupid
QdGXMaYKRik,This man has the character of a backseat driver. The problem is that the predicted changes never come true. I call that megalomania or pathological hubris.
QdGXMaYKRik,Obama had zero experience
QdGXMaYKRik,"To say Ukraine is screwed, is an understatement.  Putin’s bet paid off."
QdGXMaYKRik,DAY LATE.... DOLLAR SHORT
QdGXMaYKRik,Nailed it...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEIiaCB5l8M
QdGXMaYKRik,You've exposed yourself as the naked Emporer... go put some clothes on...
QdGXMaYKRik,"Propagandist. I still like listening to him, though I try to listen from the other side to keep me stuck from an echo chamber."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Just checking in to see if Ziehan still was putting up content. Poor guy has been wrong on everything including the collapse russian oil infrastucture, remember that load of bilge?"
QdGXMaYKRik,Please stay out of the country.
QdGXMaYKRik,Get your head right sir.
QdGXMaYKRik,"It's so crazy to me that all the MAGA folks were (rightly) complaining about Biden being old and senile but at the same time they can listen to DJT speak and think he not having the same issues. HE'S FKN OLD! wtf America. Not saying that Harris is a good candidate, but at least if she had won, I'd be confident I'd get to vote in a meaningful election in 2028."
QdGXMaYKRik,Why should anybody listen to you about geopolitics when you gig your own back yard so wrong
QdGXMaYKRik,You can tell this guy watches CNN.
QdGXMaYKRik,"So, Trump could not win you say? Fail."
QdGXMaYKRik,I thought trump was losing
QdGXMaYKRik,Well Done. Thank You
QdGXMaYKRik,"Pete. 
I love you stuff 
Your wrong on your political views and the majority of the USA citizens just proved that point.  
Thumbs down"
QdGXMaYKRik,Could you be any more biased?? You lost my support
QdGXMaYKRik,3:43 but you said she was going to win?!  Haha
QdGXMaYKRik,"I remember when Peter said Elon is basically a nazi because he comes from South Africa and his father had emerald mine. 
Bleh."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Ziehan has shown his TDS many times, he is an echo chamber of leftists and globalists hence out of touch with main street."
QdGXMaYKRik,At least you’re accountable…not!
QdGXMaYKRik,Why are people shocked he was wrong? Hes wrong more than he's right.
QdGXMaYKRik,zeihan is the perfect example of double think
QdGXMaYKRik,"Finally unsubscribing from Peter, after a long time. He links in some real facts with his own beliefs and passes them off as educated geopolitical takes. He has been so completely wrong about so many things now, from the war in the Ukraine war to the US general elections.  Unfortunately, he has now passed into the realm of propaganda, and i can no longer trust him."
QdGXMaYKRik,"So, perhaps you ought to steer clear of American political prognostications?  Maybe your intel you get from your Illegal Immigrant Sister in Law isn't all that great?  LOL"
QdGXMaYKRik,Peter is a straight 🤡
QdGXMaYKRik,"I wonder how many of this blistering comments Peter scrolled through.  He has really hurt his credibility with his early June declaration that ""Biden will win in a landslide""!"
QdGXMaYKRik,Been looking forward to this day when Trump was going to go down to the worst defeat in history. All Biden had to do was stay alive and he would win by a landslide. Good on ya Peter Zeihan!
QdGXMaYKRik,"You predicted a landslide win to the Dems, perhaps explain why you got it so wrong?"
QdGXMaYKRik,"This guy is clearly of the ""consultant class"" which will not be needed going forward. Good luck finding a new job"
QdGXMaYKRik,I guess Pete is just going to gloss over his ridiculous election prediction 🤣 🤡
QdGXMaYKRik,"Used to subscribe to this guy, but unsubbed. Thought I'd just check in one more time...still glad I unsubbed. I don't feel confidence in anything he says. Just sounds like jibberish."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Just to be clear, business conservatives are no longer a political force in this generation.  Most of their replacements have been business leftists hellbent on spending corporate money to drive culture in a Marxist direction.  This hijinks more than anything else paved the way for Donald Trump, who Republicans know isn't a Conservative, rather someone put in place to fight for a deal that doesn't involve complete cultural collapse."
QdGXMaYKRik,"His analysis of US domestic politics is so bad, it makes me question his admittedly pretty accurate foreign policy analysis."
QdGXMaYKRik,"In other words, the inmates now running the asylum."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Well, Peter is never shy with his opinions!  Frankly, I found this particular video of his to be quite fascinating, despite its brevity.  

I also would note that nearly all of the comments below are clearly from a bunch of partisan unqualified know-it-all nobodies.  No wonder the American Empire is dying before our very eyes."
QdGXMaYKRik,america has refused to put a judge in the WTF as it has to many cases against america
QdGXMaYKRik,guys been WRONG about almost EVERYTHING
QdGXMaYKRik,Your credibility is tainted from your Trump bias.   Comes from your man bun.
QdGXMaYKRik,"About 6 months ago you were convinced Biden would win against Trump in a landslide. ""It won't even be close"" I think you said. 

Clearly the demographics in the US vis-a-vis political alignment has shifted. I knew you were wrong then, but hopefully you've evolved your thinking since. You're brilliant but maybe watch more variety of news. The right wing media predicted this election far more accurately than the left."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter sees nothing of what is coming, Trump has a following through Peter Thiel and Elon Musk who will cut government spending and red tape, introducing AI , autonomy, and robotics that will supercharge the economy."
QdGXMaYKRik,Worst video he's ever done..
QdGXMaYKRik,Kamala needed more hot sauce.
QdGXMaYKRik,"member when you said Trump was toasted, member?"
QdGXMaYKRik,"Yo! Zeihan, bro I gotta give it to you--you are a hell of a a song-and-dance-man. 

You're as glib, self-assured & entertaining when when you're dead wrong as when you're almost right."
QdGXMaYKRik,Has he ever talked about his prediction that Biden would win?
QdGXMaYKRik,"Dude. Didn't u say trump was not going to be back in office? And didn't you say Russia would never retain the gains they made, even though it looks like trump will allow Russia to retain it , and that bitcoin was going to crash, yet it's soaring and will continue to as trump endorses it. .  
Your assessments have been spot on.  👊   Any other predictions and spot on analysis?"
QdGXMaYKRik,I wonder how many subs he lost with his wrong predictions.
QdGXMaYKRik,How are we not already economically disadvantaged in the relationship with China
QdGXMaYKRik,Amazing how many Maga whiners watch Peter!
QdGXMaYKRik,Bum
QdGXMaYKRik,one of my most favorite videos of the year! thank your sir!
QdGXMaYKRik,"Coward. How convenient you leave the country to avoid eating crow. What you claimed to know, has come to show, as nothing. People should rely on God not men. Peter knows nothing but no men do, who reject God and worship their own intellect."
QdGXMaYKRik,You are truly talented at spreading bullshit over your failed predictions.
QdGXMaYKRik,Rudolf the red nosed reindeer.......
QdGXMaYKRik,Surely you can’t be this stupid.  Talk to us in 4 years.
QdGXMaYKRik,"I dont blame you for being wrong. When the demographic voter data comes out and they put 2 and 2 together. Elon Musk used his power to bamboozle the zoomers. Now, after the election, he continues his conquest of creating a government agency to oversee all others and attacking the media by amplification. What do you make of all this? My anti tynranny alarms are just going off."
QdGXMaYKRik,You rock. Super interesting and unique perspective on things. Best ending ever.
QdGXMaYKRik,Damn Petter I didn't think you could be bought! Well one less you tube subscription for me...
QdGXMaYKRik,"Neither  of them  is good for US or the West... Low quality candidates... Far-right horrible ideas and far left woke horrible ideas... Choose a better, moderate, decent, common sense candidates next time! Thank you!"
QdGXMaYKRik,The readers digest version of what Peter just said… We’re screwed no matter who’s elected.
QdGXMaYKRik,Minor point but it is no longer NAFTA. It is USMCA.
QdGXMaYKRik,F that happy election day!!!!!!!!!.We just became closer to being a neo nazi nation.What good will this turn out to be!???????????.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Although the USA is the richest country in the world, why is it that it from the outside seems to be very poor? Are the key figures of economy and wealth calculated in a wrong way? And why doesn't wealth and general educational levels go together?"
QdGXMaYKRik,A touch of modesty here would increase my trust in Mr Peter truculent defiance in the face of so many predictions against Trump not a particularly good look
QdGXMaYKRik,"hey dipshit, did you mention how your propagandist predictions were totally off? Unsubbing and for always a hater."
QdGXMaYKRik,I like the coalition trump pulled together. .. vance... rfk... tulsi... musk... they mostly former democrats... maybe the logical democrats...the less emotionally unstable democrats ... im optimistic!
QdGXMaYKRik,Sour grapes makes great vinegar
QdGXMaYKRik,"Trump stepped into the fighting ring... and said ""I'll do it""...and that's all it took to watch the establishment shrivel and melt away like the wicked witch of the west."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Usa renaissance with trump,kennedy,gubbart ,musk and ither good democrates fleeing dims communist party ,people in charge now time to rebuilt"
QdGXMaYKRik,I really like your information most of the time but I can't understand how you can be so completely wrong on Trump......
QdGXMaYKRik,"Call me crazy, but I expect Trump to cut a sweet trade deal with Argentina fairly early on. They've got good demographics, a decent educational level and lots of unskilled and semi-skilled labor. Without their crazy high import tariffs on US goods left over from the socialists they can be a huge market or tractors, harvesters, mining, fracking and military equipment."
QdGXMaYKRik,"“I can tell you that in terms of the general election this is going to be at best a Goldwater style blowout.”
- Peter Zeihan, predicting an embarrassing defeat for Trump in Feb 29th 2024, “Power Hungry Podcast” with Robert Bryce, time stamp 38:06."
QdGXMaYKRik,"“The Republican Party is not going to survive this next general election. It will break. And Donald Trump will face what will probably go down in history as the second worst defeat for a presidential candidate ever.”
- Peter Zeihan, Feb 9th 2024, “Crazy Little Thing Called Geopolitics”, time stamp 39:36."
QdGXMaYKRik,Peter hasn't addressed his projecting Biden winning the election..
QdGXMaYKRik,"The left wanted to eat us rare, the right will eat us well cooked."
QdGXMaYKRik,This Democrat is so full of shit.
QdGXMaYKRik,"ALWAYS WRONG FORECAST PETER, KEEP IT GOING"
QdGXMaYKRik,This dude is so foolish..you should not be listening to him
QdGXMaYKRik,Fool. So wrong on btc. Loser gets the price he deserves
QdGXMaYKRik,"Wow, what a bad take on Trump and Vance. 

Zeihan’s greatest weakness is being seduced by his own formidable intelligence, leading to overconfidence in his opinions… which are frequently wrong."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Hiring the Democrats to run the country is like hiring Human Resources to run things.  All energy is dedicated to looking good, none to anything productive.  Hiring Republicans to run the country is like hiring your Flat Earther cousin who is also an amateur rocket engineer.  Lots of energy spent on doing stuff, often for head scratching reasons.  But sometimes it actually works."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter is a liberal and as such he suffered a mild form of TDS. Trump is highly intelligent and his stamina is doubted by no one. He also had 4 years as President and that administration was a success in spite of 100% of media and deep state working non stop to sabotage him on fronts. Comparing JD Vance to Kamala is an insult and to characterize him as an empty suit is ridiculous. He is the embodiment of American spirit, coming from nothing to becoming very successful. It is hilarious that Peter so knowledgeable about everything knows so little about the sentiment of average Americans and thus completely missed the boat on the election outcome. Talk about an embarrassment."
QdGXMaYKRik,"JD wont' be an ""empty suit"" after 4 years with Trump, if Trump utilizes him to a large extent."
QdGXMaYKRik,Peter gets many predictions wrong but I still like his way of thinking about things.
QdGXMaYKRik,This video was one of the biggest L-s you've ever made. i expect you to do better
QdGXMaYKRik,You were extremely wrong about the election unfortunately
QdGXMaYKRik,"Peter, your attempt to spin the election towards kamala and your clear bid is going to make you dizzy.  so wrong on this from past through present.  get over it i hope and straighten out that bias so i can actually listen to you"
QdGXMaYKRik,"I thought you said that Harris was the kind of person who would never make a mistake in her campaign?   I wonder if Peter ever got a chance to hear her TALK.  Even once.
And you didn't ""thoroughly piss off both sides.""  It's clear you're a Democrat."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Trump’s health is not compromised from the outset of his 2nd term of the presidency… Biden was showing signs of cognitive decline in 2020… yet they pushed him through anyway.  Vance may be president in 2028, sure I agree with that."
QdGXMaYKRik,Still haveTDS
QdGXMaYKRik,Does he plan on moving?😂😂😂
QdGXMaYKRik,What a moron
QdGXMaYKRik,"Zeihan, this might be the most shallow video you have ever made. Sometimes you must look past the political nominee and focus on the policys. Americans are sick Dem policys that have failed miserably, combined that with their ego that thinks anyone who doesnt agree with their thought process is a redneck or a hillbilly. The fact Dems lost by such a huge margin, I HOPE THAT OPENS YOUR EYES."
QdGXMaYKRik,I have also speculated that J.D. Vance might be willing to invoke the 25th Amendment in order to seize the presidency. But I would put those chances at much less than a certainty—maybe 15-20%. The backlash would be so great that it would effectively end his political career once his term was over.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Trump doesn't have the mental fortitude..? I'm done with you Zeihan. I remember when you pronounced Biden the hands down, no doubt about it next term President. Are you ever going to get tired of being wrong? I used to be a fan. I bought your books. I'm done"
QdGXMaYKRik,I think it's fair to ask why Peter was so wrong about the outcome of the election. The expectation isn't that he would be right 100% of the time.... it is that he would be intellectually honest enough to dissect the error.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Out of touch liberals like Zeihan and their smug, annoying demeanor are the reason Trump won the popular vote in a landslide."
QdGXMaYKRik,"Its not the fact that he got the Trump predictions wrong, but its the absolute confidence and arrogance he had when making them."
QdGXMaYKRik,You are such a smug asshole
QdGXMaYKRik,"I’m struggling to remember a time when Peter predicted something right. China, Russia/Ukraine, the election. The opposite has happened for all these outcomes, and he wants you to pay for his “analysis” 😂😂😂😂"
QdGXMaYKRik,You’re great man!🙌
QdGXMaYKRik,unsub
QdGXMaYKRik,"I like Peter, think he is brilliant..although I really differ in opinion on the US presidential outlooks. He is still worth listening to.."
QdGXMaYKRik,"I do hope you do an explanation of how Trump got elected, because you said he wouldn’t win the election."
QdGXMaYKRik,Finish off the pipeline and finish off the wall.
QdGXMaYKRik,This dem shill must be quacking in the boots post trump victory
QdGXMaYKRik,The TDS is strong in this one.
QdGXMaYKRik,"So Trump has no experience?  Trump won’t know how to deal with issues or foreign affairs…except he has already done all those things and successfully in the past.  And he implies that Trump is aligned with the interests of North Korea, China and Russia? False. 

Then he compares Vance to Kamala, saying both are empty suits…except Vance is a Marine, former venture capitalist, lawyer, writer, and businessman?  

Peter’s bias and/or lack of knowledge of certain details or his willingness to ignore many facts is more than a bit obvious."
QdGXMaYKRik,"5:08 ""JD Vance is even more of an empty suit than Harris."" I can't believe you just said that. Your mind must be clouded with bias if you think Vance is worse than Harris in any way, shape, or form."
QdGXMaYKRik,Seems objective and well thought out to me.
QdGXMaYKRik,"Well he does have RFK jr (lawyer) and Tulsi Gabard (congresswomen). I honestly don't think he will make the same mistake again. He does have dems and republicans in his government. Also I don't believe mentally Trump is degraded as Biden's. Biden had already had brain surgery twice before he was president so that imagine added to his cognitive decline. As much as i believe you are smart and have a really good incite into politics, I think you have a blind spot when it comes to Trump, MSM and the people voted for him. Maybe this something for you to focus on and try and understand better going forward. Other than that Peter, I appreciate your podcasts and the information you generously give the general population we no longer get from MSM. I think in a decade this will be MSM."
QdGXMaYKRik,"The past 3 years, Peter has been making videos as if Joe Biden was actually calling the shots in his administration and not just an ""empty suit"", completely ignoring the obvious mental degradation. Now he says Trump is suffering from similar mental degradation even though the man was doing laps around the Harris Campaign on interviews and rallies not to mention he was almost assassinated. I appreciate Peter for the wealth of knowledge he has about geopolitics, such as the spot on prediction he made for the Russia-Ukraine War, but unfortunately the obvious blind spot and personal dislike he has for Trump is clouding his judgement and is a huge let down."
QdGXMaYKRik,"No track record? Well, your rant doesn’t add up. I am betting on the people that support Trump. Musk, Gabbard,JFK, Sami and Vance. That is true power to do good."
QdGXMaYKRik,"5:05 Trump doesn't have the mental ability.... 🤔🤔
IGNORANT 😂"
QdGXMaYKRik,"Your video validated my view that I was very unimpressed with all the candidates running in the 2024 presidential election.  I tried to figure out which pair was the least bad, and voted for them."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Trump won
_KSQ5xKc4oM,This age like fine chunky sour milk
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"😂😂Agree polls were WRONG!! TRUMP ONE IN A LANDSLIDE!! COMMENTS PETER??,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,I wonder if Peter will ever admit he was wrong about everything regarding the election.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Yet another Peter Prediction gone wrong, lmao"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Lol, this guys analysis can't be trusted. Confidently spewing nonsense is his best skill. I can't wait for this clown to explain why we should trust his international analysis when he can't get his backyard right."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Looks like you were wrong baby boy
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Listened to every words this guy said for for like two years.  Nothing he predicted was even remotely accurate.  Including the election.  Sorry to say this, unsubscribing."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,What makes RFK Jr a conspiracy theorist?
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Peter you have no credibility left on this subject after your biden winning in a landslide comment
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"I come back to this video whenever I need a good laugh, time revealed you to be an idiot Pete."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"I've never seen this channel, I did just get back from a hike though! Lol, funny timing. I'm also so fatigued from polls 3 months after this."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Vote Blue!
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"This guy is such a whiny child. He calls RFK junior a ""batshit crazy conspiracy theorist"" and in other videos he's complained about people being rude to him in the comments. Get over yourself Peter."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Another transplant hippie in our CO mountains making a Youtube video. Great 😩
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Palestinian Zeihan teaches Americans how to vote 😅
_KSQ5xKc4oM,polls are employed by the 2 major parties only for propaganda purposes...I pay no attention to them.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"With the Electoral College and a two party race, a candidate could theoretically win with 22% of the popular vote."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Now that Kamala has taken the lead in the polls, watch Peter's next video about how you can trust the poll numbers now... lol"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"If its not the keys, it doesnt matter"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Love how liberals were all giddy about Biden before the debate, then right after “I’m not following politics” 😂😂😂😂😂 And now it’s changed to “Kamala is such a hero” just wow"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Bobby Kennedy?
_KSQ5xKc4oM,why your cant trust the ziehan
_KSQ5xKc4oM,You are right for once Zeihan. All these polls showing Queen Cackles ahead of Trump are 100% pure BS. Trump 2024!!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOL
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"""Take a hike instead"" should be the new ""touch grass"""
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"You just gave yourself away Peter.
The political version of Steven Greer."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Yep… On the way to the woodshed Biden tried to tell em you can’t trust those polls! 😂
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Hey Peter, do you still thing Joe Biden will beat Donald Trump in November?"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Id have to disagree that RFK Jr is a ""batshit crazy conspiracy theorist"""
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Because of you guys.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,This is his one glaring blind spot
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Thanks for letting your view now showing wings of evidence for jurisdiction foundation of Maga Republicans state of detonation ( self infection of stupid people who shouldn't have a voices .
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Americans will never elect a Lady..maybe in the future they will go for Melania or most probably Ivanka
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Plus the lack of honesty of people for various reasons
_KSQ5xKc4oM,RFK junior came from a preeminent political family and he’s a crazy conspiracist 🤔🤔
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Every losing politician I have ever heard say this ultimately lost.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,I hate politics. I’m here for macro economics.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Boy was Peter wrong, but he always is."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Yep, don't trust the polls. Do a Google search for ""presidential betting line"". Follow the money, only twice since 1866 has the betting favorite lost🤷‍♂️. One was Trump vs Hillary 😉"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Well Peter is not just a shill for the Democrat candidate party , he’s also an Orwellian censor. Every time I attempt to post a critical reply that his approach is the same as propaganda and that Republicans are set to take both houses of congress and the White House, he deletes it"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Sometimes prediction is simply a nudge in the direction of control....
🇦🇺"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"RFK ... isnt he the lawyer thats responsible for cleaning up the Hudson River from industry heavy metals and also winning against big pharma when they had labelled childhood vaccinations as ""safe"" without any evidence. Wish i was that bat shit crazy..."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Can someone explain how RFK is crazy?  I can be convinced but I've consumed a lot of him including his book and he seems pretty reasonable to me.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,RFJ Jr takes more support from the left than Trump
_KSQ5xKc4oM,I'm going to guess that his next update says the Dems have an even better chance of winning now. He's going to give the same reasons as this video and the last one about the election and then he's going to mention how Kamala isn't 800 years old. That's my guess.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,I took the advice.  We are hiking in the Bear Lake corridor at Rocky Mountain this week.  The best political advice I’ve had in awhile.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Mmm when the polls don't align with Peter's absurd predictions the polls must be wrong. I wonder if he'd still say that if they showed the left winning.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"""... Roosevelt lost _catastrophically_ to Wilson."" !? Really ? Remember that Roosevelt (Republican) ran against Wilson (Democrat)  *and* against Taft (Republican) splitting the Republican vote. Together Taft and Roosevelt's votes out totaled both Wilson's and Debbs's votes together. Says _something_ that he outdid Taft, the incumbent president."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Of course RFK is a conspiracy theorist, his father & uncle’s murders have been covered up for 60+ years…The sitting President  has repeatedly denied the request to bolster RFK’s security detail.

What you see is NOT all you get..I understand Peter has to tow the line, though..,Livelihood and all"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Thanks for the update.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Could this be a projection? Try finger, but hole."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"BUT, BUT, PETER'S CIA BUDDIES GUARANTEED THAT TRUMP WOULD ""GONE"" BY NOVEMBER.😂"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,You would do well to listen to RFK Jr’s ideas and platforms in his own words and not through the smear campaign of the DNC media. He is a valid independent candidate with excellent ideas for this country. I do not agree with all of them but he deserves a place in the conversation. Comments like yours ( I will not repeat it) clearly show you have not taken a look at him on your own and have only followed the character assassination narrative. I have always followed you because I felt you did your own homework.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Poor Peter, he finally would have a chance to talk about something other than two candidates no independent likes and a major shift in how US politics work, and it is the only time he isn't being asked anything while enjoying a quite hike through the... on the other hand, this is what Peter deserves for enjoying a great time away from us talking heads ;)"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Referring to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a ""conspiracy theorist"" is so predictable. It's a term regularly used by the globalists and Left against those who don't go along with their deception, lies, gas-lighting and cover-ups!"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Taken straight from the Democrat shill file: “RFK is a bat shit crazy conspiracy theorist.” Remember when Covid starting in a lab was a conspiracy? Or Biden not having the mental capacity to be president was a conspiracy? Or how Hunter Biden laptop was a conspiracy? Or how the pipeline explosion was a conspiracy? Or how Obama spied on Trumps campaign was a conspiracy? At what point does a grown up reassess all these whacky conspiracies that came true? I guess sheep are gonna sheep. No reading or doing research, just believe us all the way to the point we run corrected stories on page 6 paragraph 20. Nothing to see here"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Teddy Rosevelt also did 2 terms as president already and was running for a 3rd term. The republicans didn’t give him the nomination and Teddy started his own party splitting the Republican Party giving the election to Wilson. So thanks to Teddy you now have income taxes
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"This video is only 4 days old, but its still talking about Joe Biden... does Peter even know about Biden dropping out yet?"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,rfk will win!
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"I've been listening to Peter for a couple of years and respect his points of analysis, but now he tells us to stop ""Obsessing"" over polls and simply ""take a hike"" like he is! Apparently his faith in polls revolves around his schedule of outdoor hiking. Here's something to chew on while I take a ""break"". I guess the world is just not believable unless Peter is talking. I will no longer listen to his self-timed opinion. How did we ever make our way through the world without Mr. Zeihan.... take a hike!"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Always...so....great!!!...love this Peter!  I still haven't followed RFK Jr. enough to be an authority.  Curious why you think he's a bat shit crazy conspiracy theorist though.  Thanks as always!
_KSQ5xKc4oM,He's still in denial
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Pete. Looking.a bit distressed 😂….. when it comes to American politics I know longer take you seriously…
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Hmm, stil talks about Biden.."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,I wonder when Peter will be updating his  Election predictions   ?    
_KSQ5xKc4oM,And who can blame them? Neither one of these parties works for normal people. The only work for their donors. And they only vote for issues that interest their donors. And that is not the working public
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Independence are only 10% of the voting public? Are you out of your mind? It usually ranges between 48 and 55 percent. In fact most people are not registered either Democrat or Republican
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Sorry Peter but I think you should revisit this. Indeed polls are not written in stone.
However, you got wrong the republican party: they did indeed unite. Polls got Biden to drop out. So do they matter? Yes. Are they so black and white? No. But if time again and again you see the same...that matters"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Well.....he is still alive and he's definitely not going to be the president
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Well we can guarantee it won't be Biden now
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"RFK is right and you are wrong. You predicted a Biden landslide, now he's so far behind that he quit."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Tap dancing in US politics is not your forte. Thank god. Enjoy your walk. Peace
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Ignore the polls is exactly what people say when they're gonna try to cheat AGAIN
_KSQ5xKc4oM,This guy has serious TDS
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Back here after biden dropped
_KSQ5xKc4oM,This video has a surplus of cope
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Joe Biden is gone Peter! Whatcha gotta say????
_KSQ5xKc4oM,I wonder what the polls will say about Harris
_KSQ5xKc4oM,disappointing (and narrow minded) comment on RFK.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Biden will be re-elected. 😵‍💫
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Let's also remember when Ross Perot ran in 1992. Bill Clinton wasn't a big name before 1992, and more people voted AGAINST Clinton than for him. However, Perot drew Republican voters and young, undecided voters away from H.W. Bush, getting Clinton the win. As for Gore in 2000, I will never fully forgive Michael Moore for endorsing Nader, basicallly saying ""Why should you vote for the lesser of two evils?"" Moore would act like he had nothing to do with Gore's loss in his movie ""Fahrenheit 9/11."""
_KSQ5xKc4oM,This aged very well
_KSQ5xKc4oM,Dude just lost all credibility calling RFKjr a “bat-shit crazy conspiracy theorist”.
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Peter, thanks for explaining the Electoral College System. Sounds very undemocratic."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"RFK is batshit crazy? The longer I’m around the more I’m sure that he’s not that shit crazy. The system or is that shit crazy, the vaccine for Batshit crazy the fact that all of our politicians are just whores for whatever special interest is putting money on our coffers is crazy."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"I'm sorry Peter, Nevada and Arizona are not toss ups. Trump is firmly in control there.  The big problem that the Dems have is that most likely NV, AZ, and GA are all likely going to Trump, regardless of who the Dem nominee ends up being. That gives, if my math is correct, Trump 267 electoral votes. That means he only needs to win one of MI, WI, or PA. If the Dems don't sweep those states, they are done. Layer on top of that the fact that the latest polling out of VA, NH, NM, and MN are all showing a race within 3 points one way or the other and the Dems are really in trouble.  I understand the point of your vid was not to trust the polls, and yes a lot can change. But the big difference this election is everyone pretty much knows how they are going to vote at this point (especially if Harris is the nominee).  But the dems have an extremely large hill to climb.  

I hate that these are our options. Sigh..  I pray the dems actually nominate the Governor of Kentucky or Pennsylvania. Those are people I could vote for.  Harris is asking way too much. I'm likely just going to write Mitt Romney this year."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Politics: 24 hours can change everything… if you not up to date, you might as well take a hike!! 😂
Have a good vacation !"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,This from the guy who predicted Biden was a shoo in
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"Peter is absolutely right. The national polls are almost meaningless. If you look at the map on the website he suggested it’s clear that the election hinges on the states shaded in beige, mainly Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona. They will determine the outcome of the election."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"don't look at the polls, peter knows the polls don't capture all of the cheating the DNC/deepstate will be doing. peter is such a POS"
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"~3:25 “narrow margin”. 

In Bush v. Gore (2000),  
W. only won by 1, 5-4. 

That was all he needed."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"The sane move is to ignore the politics/turn off the TV until Nov-then do your own policy-voting history homework and decide your vote.  The TV and the demagogues are cheerleaders at best, but in reality, just noise.  Do your own homework."
_KSQ5xKc4oM,"One more factor that you didn't mention, is the fact, that in many states across the country, numerous anti-gerrymandering lawsuits have been won, thereby effectively eliminating Republican gerrymandering, and making voting fair in those states. Wisconsin is among those states!"
