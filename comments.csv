5EBGhSqj8k0,"He withheld funding because all the help he sent went straight into the pockets of the corrupt politicians and the massive amount of bottled water arrived but they failed to distribute it.  Shame on the corrupt politicians not on Trump.  Remember, in a court of law one pledges to tell the whole truth.  Press are under the same obligation albeit not the same consequences."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"4:28 if this doesn’t open your eyes to the news media being extremely left-sided against Trump then I don’t know what else to tell you. She goes on for about a minute and a half listing everything bad that Trump has ever done. OK what about anything good Trump has ever done? No one ever talks about how he makes it easier for black convicts to be in incarcerated a second time without being beaten to death. They don’t talk about the that have opened up for the black community. They don’t talk about the way Trump cleaned up our border and putting in new facilities and keeping children and women from being raped by our own people. But instead, they choose to spend 100% of their time making him look like a goddamn criminal."
5EBGhSqj8k0,🌹
5EBGhSqj8k0,So is this truck British that you drive on the right side? Or was this just missed in the photo op?

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump shouldn't associate w fools, then say I don't know him. I don't know the comedian, but hes great. I don't know what Loomer says but I think she is great. REALLY???"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Yup, Trump even shows us that he should be a garbage truck driver. He is such a liar yet he brought up what the “comedian” said about Puerto Rico and he agreed with him! You trump lovers voting on a liar? Be my guest and have fun with project 2025, look it up and don’t start to weep if he wins! 🤦🏻‍♀️"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"So sad to see so much darkness in the world, but there is light and life in Jesus Christ John 14:6 ""Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me."" Receive Jesus today by faith (placing your trust in Him alone) 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 ""3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that He appeared to Cephasa and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 8 And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one of untimely birth."""

5EBGhSqj8k0,This just secured my vote for trump going today
5EBGhSqj8k0,🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💯👍👍
5EBGhSqj8k0,Fake fake news.. can’t even report a straight story ..
5EBGhSqj8k0,"On behalf of Democrats, Liberals, and let-wing extremists (you know who you are), the MSM is constantly putting issues on their own shoulders, and daring their opponent(s) to ""knock it off"" (i.e. Trump, etc.). They do this on purpose so that they can then create a group of ""offended"" people, somewhere, and get them riled up about Trump being some kind of legitimate ""hater"" of those people. What a joke!

FOR EXAMPLE::

A comedian who spoke at a recent Trump rally this week described Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage"". Yes, he said that. The MSM then took this sound bite and spun it so that the ""garbage"" reference was to the Puerto Rican PEOPLE and not to THE LITERAL TRASH PROBLEM the nation is currently experiencing. Did you get that, MSM? The ""garbage"" word was correctly aimed at a REAL PROBLEM which the island of Puerto Rico is struggling through IN REAL LIFE. The term had nothing to do with ""people"" being described as ""garbage"", and you know it. Or else your reading comprehension is less than that of a third grader. Do you know who undoubtedly laughed the hardest at the comedian's joke? Puerto Ricans. Because thy knew exactly what he was talking about, unlike the MSM who weaponized and twisted his words to create a group of OFFENDED HATERS against the same man the US news media hates. Those are the FACTS. But please, news media, whatever you do, don't look up this headline:

""Puerto Rico Trash Problem: Understanding the Crisis and Working Toward Solutions""

Because, if you do do a little searching, you will discover the true meaning of the comedian's words. Yes, you purposely lied to the American people (with malice aforethought) regarding this whole issue. Shame on you (for the trillionth time)."
5EBGhSqj8k0,I am gonna be honest... I would vote for this guy just for the memes.
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's just validating what Biden said if he's in a garbage truck. So he's saying that MAGA is garbage too? OMG

5EBGhSqj8k0,Finding out how he looks in orange.
5EBGhSqj8k0,What are the odds? Trump not knowing anything about the trash comment about Puerto Rico. Then having a spanking new garbage truck with a trump campaign sticker on it's side at the ready a couple of days later. He knew it all along.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Oh my lord he did👍 when's the last time u ever saw a president reach out to regular working class people?

Our greatest power is not political and the minute you believe that your greatest power is political, your greatest power is political influence, you will compromise the gospel. It always happens. You see, our power is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ because the gospel of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ has the power to do what politics could never, ever do; and that is rescue and transform the heart of a person. World Bless God Again!!!% Deus Lo Vult 🔥🙏⚔🛡✝️🇬🇪🇨🇭🏴⛪️"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Revelation 13:1-18

Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names. The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast. They worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?” A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him. He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, his dwelling, and those who dwell in heaven. It was given to him to make war with the holy ones and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed. If anyone has an ear, let him hear. If anyone is to go into captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the holy ones. I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people. He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived. It was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn’t worship the image of the beast to be killed. He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands or on their foreheads; and that no one would be able to buy or to sell unless he has that mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"America is suppose to be a Constitutional Republic  . Not a socialist democracy banana republic we have today.  America died and gone to Hell  . Satan's Final Plan for his Last Days are Unfolding Before Our Eyes!  Are you Ready??? %  Is The United States A Republic Or A Democracy?
American flag in front of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC. 
American flag in front of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC.
The United States of America is governed as a federal republic, and therefore some argue that the U.S. is not a democracy. A republic is defined as a political system in which the supreme power is vested upon the citizenry that is entitled to vote for its representatives and officers responsible to them, while a democracy is defined as a government of the people and by the people exercised through elected or direct representative. It can be difficult to distinguish between a democracy and a republic, and therefore it would be rational to conclude that the United States is both a democracy and a republic.

Why Is The United States A Republic?
The key difference between a republic and a democracy is not how power is projected, but the limits to power. Both use the representational system, meaning that the citizenry is represented in the government by elected leaders. In both cases, the majority rule, but in a republic the constitution limits how the government can exercise power. These rights are inalienable and cannot be changed or altered by an elected government. The United States is a typical example of a republic state because the constitution limits the power of the government. Some rights such as the Bill of Rights, the right to vote, and the powers to amend the constitution are limited and cannot be changed by the sitting government without consulting the public directly.

Is The United States A Democracy?
The United States is a democracy, but it is not a true democracy. Instead, it is a representative democracy. The common forms of democracy are direct democracy and representative democracy. A direct democracy is a system of government in which the majority have their say on every matter concerning governance. Direct democracies hold referendums each time an issue has to be decided upon because there are no elective representatives. The United States is a representative democracy, as the public elects individuals to represent them at the government level. The United States is also a constitutional democracy, meaning that the functions and roles of the government are governed by the constitution that also protects the rights and privileges of the citizenry regardless of whether they are majority or minority.

Democratic Republics
Modern states present themselves as democratic republics governed by a constitution. The government can amend the constitution through acts of parliaments and referendums. As long as the constitution continues to protect the rights of the people, the citizenry continues to vote for representatives, and the constitution limits the power of the government, the United States remains both a republic and a democracy.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"I am a South Korean, but I passionately support Trump. Unless you're a monkey, you know that getting U.S. back on track won't hurt our allies. And the public opinion supporting the U.S. president in South Korea is split exactly in half, just like the public opinion in the U.S. Harris' policy was already implemented in South Korea seven years ago, and we are experiencing numerous job losses and a plummeting currency value. South Korea's economy is not yet known to the outside world, but it is in a very serious state."

This will have a significant impact on the Korean War situation. While it may seem beneficial for Trump to extract a lot from countries, including South Korea, for now, it could lead to another world war in the future. If not, inflation will certainly rise significantly. People of America!"""

5EBGhSqj8k0,"“The white liberals, who have been posing as our friends, have failed us. The white liberal is the worst enemy to America and the worst enemy to the black man.”
“White liberals are those who have perfected the art of selling themselves to the black man as our ‘friend’ to get our sympathy, our allegiance and our minds. The white liberal attempts to use us politically against white conservatives, so that anything the black man does is never for his own good, never for his advancement, never for his own progress, he’s only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal.”

All mainstream media is bought and paid for. I hope America wakes up, because we need to find a way to stop hating each other and start working together to fix this nation.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"The most appropriate scenario for the dirty old limo looney. Garbage hauling garbage. The biggest lie Donald John ""I'm a stable genius"" Trump will ever tell is NOT that the 2020 election was stolen.

5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump & Co have taken advantage of the dumbest people in society.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"How does trump get votes? I know who and what the Trumpet is but I have no idea why he gets a vote. I will pity the US and humanity at large, if US voters re elect this Mussolini channeler. He is an arrogant, uneducated, narcissistic, bombastic, simpleton who hardly speaks the English language. His lies are epic and transparent. His rhetoric is characterised by its empty content. The sad indictment of the US is that people give him any support at all. The rest of the thinking world laughs nervously at him with the underlying fear that he will have Presidential power again. If you want to make America great again, get rid of this dangerous narcissistic psychopath. Vote him out!"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"My two cents, the comedian was doing what he does. It was meant to be a laugh not an insult. That being said I also doubt that Biden did not intend to say all Trump supporters were garbage.  But when you want to hold one accountable then you have to hold them all to the same standards.    Think about this, how cool would it have been for Kamala or Biden to have laughed at what Trump did with the truck and the vest.   The media could have made light of it as well but no they could not do that.  There is NO reason that both Party’s can’t have different views without the hate for each other. And I am an independent and from what I see it seems like the Democrats are very quick to lay down the hate to any Republican.  I can stand between either and not have any ill will to either party. Good and bad in both party’s, pick the best that each has to offer. It’s the only way this country gets back to the respect and pride it once had."

Or she knows Rogan fact checks EVERYTHING and knows more about his guests than they do. He's very fair, so if she's telling the truth she has nothing to fear.  I fact checked her and she  lied about Trump's policies and has  distorted his statements. See for yourself by listening to his full interviews and not the sound bites mainstream media wants you to hear."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"What kind of a ""news"" organization would put this up without the video of Trump approaching and trying to climb into this Garbage Truck. I am old enough to rememer when ABC News was aNews organization. Sad times. I'm sure you will enjoy your future in the news world with Trump as your president."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"I’m an outsider to American politics, but here’s my perspective: Trump has always been outspoken, often unwilling to compromise. His goal has consistently appeared to be improving the U.S. economy. Even in the 1980s, he criticized trade practices, particularly Japan’s economic gains at the expense of the U.S., telling Larry King, 'This has to stop. We can’t keep running a trade deficit.' His message has remained similar over the years: America needs a stronger position in global trade.

Trump has substance in his arguments, though his approach can be abrasive, often using shock value to make his point. Yet, his intent has never seemed malicious. On the other hand, Democrats have demonstrated a strong organizational machine, able to navigate and leverage the political system effectively. This includes rallying around candidates, even those who might not seem ideal, with a unified strategy.

Republicans, after having four years to address concerns about election fraud, still find themselves facing similar questions. From an outsider’s view, it seems they may miss an opportunity again, as Democrats are relentless in managing the fine details that push initiatives forward.

The “Make America Great Again” concept is powerful, but Republicans often focus on broad strokes and can overlook the importance of detailed follow-through. Democrats’ meticulous attention to every step in the process is one of the reasons they maintain an edge in these battles. Going forward, Republicans may benefit from focusing on these details to turn their big-picture ideas into lasting policies.

The world would love to see Trump win. But … Democrats is just more superior in manufacturing something out of NOTHING. This is not a fair fight."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Karl Rove said that there are deep divisions in American politics.  That’s obvious.  The challenge for Americans is to put aside those divisions which will be possible as long as one side or the other accepts the election and feels it is fair even if they lose. The key is it must appear to be and actually be fair and legal.  If one side or the other attempts to cheat, there will be repercussions.  This will not be in the interest of the American people.  The challenge for us is to keep election voting clean and then support the winning side.  Protests are likely but the hope is they will be nonviolent.  We must follow the constitution or our Democracy will be in danger."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"The Trump administration signed off on sex-change surgeries for transgender prisoners, according to reports.

Officials in the justice department gave the green light to procedures that also included hormone therapy and hair removal in 2018 while Donald Trump was in the White House, the New York Times reports.

The Republican presidential candidate has repeatedly attacked Kamala Harris for having previously supported sex changes for transgender inmates.

Prison bureau officials wrote in a budget memo to Congress in February 2018 that the government was obligated to pay for sex-change procedures if deemed medically necessary.

“Transgender offenders may require individual counselling and emotional support,” they said.

“Medical care may include pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., cross-gender hormone therapy), hair removal and surgery (if individualised assessment indicates surgical intervention is applicable).”

However, a long-running legal battle delayed the first such operation until 2022, after Trump had left office.

Ms Harris accused Trump of hypocrisy when questioned on her former support for the policy in a Fox News interview on Wednesday evening.

“I will follow the law and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed,” she said.

“Under Donald Trump’s administration these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis to people in the federal prison system.”

She said a Trump campaign advert attacking her for supporting the procedures was “throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house”, adding: “You’ve got to take [responsibility] for what happened in your administration.”

The Trump campaign hit back following the interview, accusing the vice president of “lying” and noting that the first sex-change surgery of a federal inmate occurred in 2022 under Ms Harris.

The 2018 memo from Trump officials reflected guidelines issued in the final weeks of Barack Obama’s administration the previous year.

The Trump administration created a higher barrier to taxpayer-funded surgeries by adding the word “necessary” to treatment guidelines, the New York Times noted."
5EBGhSqj8k0,liar

You can't even go shopping without the stink eye from some angry young white so called christian man. 2025 will put women in the 1800s. The Supreme Court has made slavery on the ballot by taking way the right to control your body which is the definition of slave. .

5EBGhSqj8k0,"One of Trumps speakers called democrats degenerates,the press doesn't report that.  Always giving the sicko clown a free pass never talks about how awful 4 years of the sicko clown rapist was. Worst 4 years in this countries history.

5EBGhSqj8k0,Did Latinos think he only hates Haitians? A racist is a racist. Trump will only deport Latinos.
5EBGhSqj8k0,You have to wonder about the element that votes for an accused rapist. If he raped their daughter would they vote for him?

5EBGhSqj8k0,"SO, Diaper Boy, I've seen you staggering, dragging your leg, unable to walk a line. This is called COMPENSATORY MUSCLE MOTION. It happens when one group of muscles compensates for other muscles paralyzed by STROKE! The inability to find words, slurring, repetition of speech, etc. ALL SIGNS OF STROKE! I did CVA, cerebrovascular accident, recovery for YEARS! You're stroking out, tangerine. Pretty soon, you'll be on stage at one of your Klan Rallies and half your face is gonna slide three inches father down than your double chin!! ROFL!!! Drool is gonna POUR outta that toilet of a gob of yours and one eye is going to go full bloodshot! It's gonna look like a bright red spider's web! Look on the bright side, Jr. is doing so much speed, you two can be in the same CCU together! My guess is that Jr's gonna have a full PFE, though. That's a prefrontal embolism. That's very painful, too. Like a 12 gauge buck shot to the forehead. You don't die right away because it's too far from the bits that make you breathe and trigger your heart, so it LASTS FOR HOURS!!! My aunt had a PFE. Her daughter found her face down on the bed, shoes still on, moaning in pain. Couldn't form words, and in so much AGONY, she couldn't even look at her daughter. Satan is coming to get his due. I'd imagine you're nervous every time you lie down in bed. Is this gonna be the night? Will you wake up in pain? Unable to call for help? Bed soaked in urine and a full diaper? Will the people around you help? Or do they harbor some I'll will because you've tested them badly? Will they just stand over you...watching...waiting for you to stop breathing? Giggling and going through your wallet? Sweet dreams."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Yoo-hoo hey Trump you're in the wrong end of a garbage truck! Look over your shoulder, go to the rear of the truck. There are no steps to climb, theres just some hydraulics.... there you go... that's a good boy.🫢"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"I hope that Trump will win the election. If he does not, the American economy will decline, and established Western values—such as traditional family, religion, and national identity—will be replaced by modern ideologies like critical race theory and gender identity theory. This shift will be harmful not only to the United States but to the entire world."
5EBGhSqj8k0,can we ration this that it is for the benefit of Puerto Rico it is true that the Island has waste management problem It was on the news and needs to be dealt with the Islanders should have mobilized and put attention to the problem so they get funds to fix the problem so now they got the attention say Thank you comedian obviously Biden/Kamala are out to lunch working on filling their pockets....that is not something new for Biden with grandkids as oil consultants and Kamela getting free BMW and sallery 2-3 times more then her coworkers....

Select those that can be paired with a talking point, which once declared, will appear to be a binary opposite, & thus, a direct dispute, to the given trump bullet point, when in actuality the point is kept purposely general, allowing for a minimum of mutual exclusivity. Do the above steps, all while wielding an air of derision, superiority, & authority, regardless it be unearned.

5EBGhSqj8k0,TRUMP 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,Criminal media
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump’s MAGA party consists of Jerry Springer guests who are mainly white. I did not realize that even rich Trump supporters can be labeled white trash.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"This is the photo that will be on The Oval Office's wall during President Harris' time in office and forever show to visitors in The White House how much it values the former president's service. It beautifully shows what sort of work the former American President is capable of doing and what he specializes in. It's the right job for him and by picking up garbage, Trump will indee Make America Clean Again (MACA) and why not have a new TV show with guests driving the rounds with him emptying dust bins and then rallying at the dump for photo ops?"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"ABC get your facts straight.
It's in WISCONSIN not North Carolina."
5EBGhSqj8k0,I pray God he wins but 13 keys say No.I pray to God he wins if not we are on a downward spiral that were not gonna be able to get out of.

5EBGhSqj8k0,Love it!!! Hate how ABC reported!!!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Immature. The choices this year suck on both sides.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump’s focus is strictly to get the country back and actually run it. No need to sugar coat anything.

Kamala’s focus is simply to win the minorities vote with the usual speeches and promises just to get in office and be the first female president."
5EBGhSqj8k0,hahaha trump in a garbage truck. How appropriate. 😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump should keep this GARBAGE truck at hand.

Picking up the trash. 
White trash only.😂"
5EBGhSqj8k0,People outside the Fox bubble know Biden was referring to the comically unfunny Hinchcliffe. People inside the Fox bubble enjoy the cheap thrill of pretending someone called them garbage.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"How appropriate Trump's name on a GARBAGE TRUCK! 
Picking up the trash.

5EBGhSqj8k0,With a year of garbage truck driver training I think we have finally found something Trump is actually qualified to do.
5EBGhSqj8k0,After the election he needs to take that truck to washington and get that trash out out of there
5EBGhSqj8k0,Finally admit that he is nothing but garbage!  It suites him well being a garbage.
5EBGhSqj8k0,So perfect to be on that truck since this idiot is trash

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Choose Harris: 

1). 25% Tax a YEAR on unrealised profits on your house, savings, stock 

2). 44,6 % capital gains tax on your house, stocks, savings when you sell. Remember you already paid 25% tax a year 

3). price ceiling: unemployment, empty shops, bankruptcy 

4). No tax on China products. But higher taxes on USA products 

5). 28% corporate tax: corporates moving out of the USA, bankruptcy, unemployment 

6) Inflation + 10% the coming years 

It will make you poor as hell. And you will be government controlled. 

Harris will turn the USA into a German DDR. Calling it democracy. Hell on Earth. 

I am European and saw it from very nearby. You don't want this to happen! Visit a DDR museum in Berlin.  

Look at facts. Not personality's"

If this was some TV show that would be great but it’s actually about the lives of millions and millions of people, even outside of the USA. The fact that he’s great at using the media doesn’t make him a trustworthy person to be taking the most important job in the world. Vote with your heads, people."
5EBGhSqj8k0,I came straight to the comment section.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Correction ABC, Trump heavily supported Puerto Rico in the wake of hurricane Maria. The Puerto Rican politicians seized that aid, and refused to distribute it to the people. These Puerto Rican politicians have been highly criticized for being corrupt. At the time, in the wake of Maria, I remember reports of warehouses full of stuff that had not been distributed to the people."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Pennsylvania officials held a press conference addressing those ballots and finding. Saying they’re pushing back on whether or not it was deliberate?  So the same person filled out many multiple ballots on accident?

5EBGhSqj8k0,Anyone want to ask him about Biden’s aka The Presidents comment calling half the country Garbage?
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Of course not, the people who are considering voting for Donald Trump are not ""garbage"" but they are what we could call ""lost sheep"" who have not understood that one should not vote for a candidate, whether Republican or Democrat, when he shows signs of ""psychological disorders""."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is coming back to Washington to take out the garbage. ❤❤❤❤ trump 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,Lies and Lies.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Most genius political move in history!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"I had the impression that the garbage was piled in the back, not in the front"

5EBGhSqj8k0,This proves the Porto Ricans hate speech was delibate and part of an orchestrated attack on a minority
5EBGhSqj8k0,He should have put pitures of biden and harris on the truck and said hes tking the rubbish out
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Er ist wie er ist, und damit ist er das geworden was er ist, und vor 30 Jahren hat man bei ihm angefragt ob er Präsident werden will. Er wurde darauf angesprochen, nicht er hat gesagt er will es werden, man hielt ihn damals bereits für jemanden der dort hin gehört, oder dort hin tendieren sollte, und das kann auch nicht jeder von sich behaupten. Ob man nun gut oder schlecht findet was er macht, was er ist, er ist seit einem ganzen Jahrzehnt fast täglich auf dem Schirm, und auch davor kannte ihn fast die ganze Welt vermutlich. Das was er macht oder kann, ist eben etwas ganz anderes als die meisten kennen, heißt aber auch nicht das das keinen Erfolg bringt wie man sah und sieht. Und wie es auch sein wird nächste Woche, alles hat seine Zeit. 
Er ist halt anders, und auch die Welt war früher eine andere, und streicht man deswegen die Geschichte, man lernt daraus und dazu, und man wird sehen, wie die Amerikaner dem ganzen gegenüber stehen, in jedem Fall viel Glück für gute Entscheidungen und Entwicklungen die allen gut tun."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Truck on its way to clean up Puerto Rico 😂😂 if he lucky in that tuck, he get a b#ow job 😂😂"
5EBGhSqj8k0,He is delusional looking
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Nice. What a con man 😂 first he calls Americans from different ethnic groups' names,  America as a garbage can and now distracting people and MEDIA to go after his created drama.
America, who gave us the Chips Act, Infrastructure Act, Veterans who were impacted by Burn Pit, etc.
Crime is the lowest. Yes, prices went up a might stay there and keep in mind that is true for whole world (US did better than all) when coming out of the pandemic, inflation has moderated now, economy is strong and no matter who becomes president will reap the benefits of Biden administration's foundational work.
Trump has nothing to offer and will be lost years if he becomes president.  
Good luck and vote responsibly 🇺🇸"
5EBGhSqj8k0,So many lies....
5EBGhSqj8k0,"ABC,NBC,MSNBC,CNN all are disgusting liars that spin reality to fit their corrupt evil narrative, they all need to go bankrupt. TRUMP 2024 its time to take out the trash."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump is definitely lying about not knowing who Tony Hinchcliffe is 😂

5EBGhSqj8k0,"A trump truck that’s literally taking in and carrying garbage .. 

This is the epitome of the entire campaign"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"that's exactly where trump belongs. 4 years of in-competence, endless lies, disaster management of covid. An almost 80-year-old man with the brain of a 12-year-old is not fit to lead the United States."

5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump can’t wait for the election to be over so he can get back to the golf course
5EBGhSqj8k0,First at McDonald's and now at the garbage disposal. Trump is probably already applying for a job if he loses😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,"the orange criminal looks ill, white lips = bad heart."
5EBGhSqj8k0,The garbage man in a garbage truck - pretty damn appropriate
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Finally a truck that is appropriately named.  Hey, one thinks Puerto Rico is garbage, the other thinks people who are easily manipulated and spend their savings on a millionaire to be garbage. So be it."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump, tu te trompes de place, les déchets comme toi, c'est dans la benne du camion qu'ils doivent entrer."

5EBGhSqj8k0,Winner ❤ Donald Trump 🎉
5EBGhSqj8k0,What? Hes driving that to Puerto Rico too?
5EBGhSqj8k0,"He has to do this when the fake news activists won't report the truth that the comedian referred to the pollution problem of PR and instead spew lies again, creating a climate that almost got Trump killed. Typical for the billionaire corporate propaganda news."
5EBGhSqj8k0,If supporting Trump makes me garbage then I guess I’m a landfill.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Love how ABC left out the fact that our president called half the country garbage and that you can’t lead a country if you hate the citizens of that country. I guess ABC hates us too

5EBGhSqj8k0,"😄😄😄
He has his shadows, but he is really good with this stuff.
I believe he is going to win due to know how to read the moments and take the maximum advantaged.
This is actually genius, it keeps all the attention to the Biden's insult in the final time election.
This last perform will probably take him to WH."
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's setting it up again.. So he can say the election was rigged when he loses. Oh yeah he is gonna lose. In a very huge way.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Best time for Trump to come back now the world needs trump 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,"This is actually the job that Donald has always dreamt of.

5EBGhSqj8k0,Oh he wasn’t in back?  He’s so Old and smelly ya know I thought he would be…. Still not dead yet?
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Regardless of what Biden thinks about Trump's voters, there is a grain of truth that some of Trump's votes are garbage. You can't exactly call them the cream of America's population. They understandably feel bad, but the problem is that they are pointing at a president who is ten times worse than Harris. It's so easy for Trump to say he will improve the economy, especially when he's standing outside the White House!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,What an idiot.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Is that a garbage truck or is that a Puerto Rican truck?
5EBGhSqj8k0,Alot ppl dress with like a hat or shirt or something that matches their shoes. But 1st time i seen someone wear something that matches their spray tan😂MAKE AMERICA GAG AGAIN 🤮

He says he'll clean up, make things bright,
Drive out the wrong, set things right.
But look closer, see the lies,
Trash piles up, stacked high as skies.

He talks of change, of clearing mess,
But leaves behind more, not less.
Words sound good, but truth runs deep,
Hidden in promises he’ll never keep."
5EBGhSqj8k0,He won.

5EBGhSqj8k0,The silly prick got in the wrong end
5EBGhSqj8k0,Seriously though the way he got into the truck wasn't funny. Makes me wonder if he's had a stroke? That's not normal.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Notice how the reporter leads with the Inconsequential headline of Tony Hinchcliffe, a comedian making a remark towards Puerto Rico, but totally undercuts the statements of a current sitting president and his vice president making the same remarks towards the American people also notice how they barely mention what they call a small discrepancy in the ballots. If those 2600 ballads had Donald Trump‘s name on them believe me it would’ve been On every single front page and the leading headline across all media, they would probably try to impeach Donald Trump saying he colluded to commit election fraud! They’re more concerned with whether or not Donald Trump will concede defeat if he loses, and there is no evidence of cheating, but they will not admit that there is evidence that cheating is going on and an election is not held with integrity then it is not a true election and that IS a threat to democracy! ….
See with your eyes, hear with your ears, and use your brain !"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Biden claims he only called Trump 'garbage' but.... That is NOT what he said.  Why didn't ABC play the recording of Biden's comments?  And play Harris's comments calling Jews 'Brownshirts'.  And, when Trump says such people saying such things are 'evil' and 'The enemy within', why doesn't ABC play the comments in context, instead of changing the meaning by changing the context?
But, hey, those that do not fall for the fake news are loving it.  ""Loving it?"".  Makes me think of McDonald's for some reason....  I would like to go down to McD's right now and get some searing hot french fries.....  Er, American fries......"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Master Manipulator! Magician and Con Artist. Look at my crooked, lying mouth while I steal your money to pay my legal bills... not my taxes! 🧙‍♂️😈🐛"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"With American culture being so ""macho"" and chauvinistic; and, as Trump has a much upper hand according to voters when it comes to the economy - it's almost impossible and seemingly certain that Trump will be the next president of the US.

That aside, very, very rarely do Americans let women lead or give women a higher office - in spite of all the trumpeting that America makes about women's ""rights"" and ""freedom"". Then, there is Harris's race which doesn't give her much (any?) chance. Kamala Harris appears to be very much a duplicate of Biden - which too will sway many voters against her."

*He says that all the time, that he loves the uneducated! And now we know why! Because they are as dumb as a box of rocks, super gullible, easily manipulated, and very easy to lie to!*
*That is why I firmly believe that before you are allowed to vote, you must be aware of current affairs, and have some idea what reality is, and how the world actually works!*"

Repo-Man has nothing on Trump. **Trump is the MAGA-MAN 2024 with a Garbage Truck.**

I'm just not sure one garbage truck is enough to collect all the garbage that's out there! I
know we're gonna need a whole fleet of garbage trucks, to collect the Democrats and the
mess they've created. This may well be Detroit's first order when Trump is back in office,
and sign this, his first Executive Order. **Swamps need Garbage Trucks to clean them out.**
Trump's first term in office, was a rookie's mistake."

Please be careful with your reporting. History will remember you for this."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Notice how at the start they voiced over Trump explaining how Biden called Trump supporters ""Garbage?"" I don't know how these ""journalists"" can look at themselves in the mirror!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,He withheld the funds to Puerto Rico because he knew their government wouldn’t give the aid to the people. Puerto Rico has an insanely corrupt government.

Yeah, right. This con man gets away with saying any BS"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"He turned the heart of the people from hatred to laughter…imagine half the populace laughing over this rather than being angry over Joe’s comments.

Puerto Rico has 5 million registered voters and NO they do not like him and certainly don't love him.
His team scratched calling Harris the c-word. It was in the script. 
What do these christian followers tell their kids? 
What a disgrace. America is not a trash can. Allow Puerto Rico to vote on statehood.

The MSG arena was packed from the floor...to the roof.   [ It holds 19,000 people ]  People were standing in the aisles....AND outside the arena.   REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP VISITED THE BARBERSHOP,  IN CASTLE HILL?  Yeah---that's JLo's neighborhood. 😐  That's the street where she used to buy her ham and cheese---on a roll. 😏

Who cheered for Trump, outside & inside the barbershop? Latinos.  JLO needs to worry about testifying  in Sean Combs' upcoming  criminal trial.   NOT Donald Trump!"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Get your facts straight ABC. Seriously. Puerto Rico's govenor stored all the supplies on several warehouses because she wanted Trump to look bad. 
Joe Biden called Trump supporters ""garbage"" just last night. And ABC had no idea why Trump is in a garbage truck. How can you ever call yourselves journalists??"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Oh look it's garbage that stumbled and almost fell over while getting in a garbage truck!

5EBGhSqj8k0,Orange trash stuffed in garbage truck
5EBGhSqj8k0,"So dishonest, this “reporter”. Joe Biden called MAGA people “garbage” and Trump wasn’t withholding aid—the local government was withholding all the aid he sent. I just watched the footage on that the other day."
5EBGhSqj8k0,He is insulting real garbage truck drivers… when he should be in a septic tank suck truck!
5EBGhSqj8k0,The job he should have had instead of inheriting and ruining his father’s business.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Decline because of the hate he made okay.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Kamala laughs but it is not clear what is funny. Trump does not smile much but he is sure funny.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Wow taking questions from reporters?hairass and byeden take notes!
5EBGhSqj8k0,His orange makeup is running 🍊🤡💩
5EBGhSqj8k0,Finally he is where he belongs.

5EBGhSqj8k0,Does Trump have his drivers license ? After that double missed handle grab can someone recommend to the DMV he get tested because of his age ?
5EBGhSqj8k0,I’ve been at Democrat all my life living in Chicago and I see what’s going on and it’s disgraceful. Vote Trump. He will save this country from destruction.-Kamala Harris
5EBGhSqj8k0,Brett Favre is a great guy? He can't even spell his last name correctly.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"He did not hear the commedian speech but ehy is he in a garbage truck, if this is because of Biden speech then Biden should say the comedian leftvthe country lets see if he will leave, i pray for the day when we dont see this big lump of orange SH.....t"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"“What he calls is a garbage truck” These “journalists” don’t know what a garbage truck looks like. Literally see it at the end of the clip. 🤡

5EBGhSqj8k0,He's so over the top😂😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Happy to be ""garbage"" and a ""deplorable"" who voted for Trump!!!!!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Nancy & Dementia Joe are going to fit in that Truck quite well the day after the election 
5EBGhSqj8k0,ABCs' bias is clear when they try to minimize and take the thunder out of the message. People aren't THAT stupid. ABC should be embarrassed. Smart people are going to switch networks!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Maybe he was trying to take out what he calls garbage. All due respect to the people of Puerto Rico and others he considers garbage.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"I’m a over the road truck driver, I wish we can vote at any weight station or rest area while we working all over the country."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Go ahead call me garbage, better than being called a democrat"

5EBGhSqj8k0,you the best mr trump you are every where
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Wow ABC, ""Trump taking questions from reporters inside a truck""???   Kinda like ""I think they're saying Let's Go Brandon"" when they were clearly saying f.... Joe Biden."
5EBGhSqj8k0,The guy clearly has balls. Making fun of these loony libs is hilarious.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Looked up ABC News just to see what they would say…as expected, GARBAGE reporting! Hah. Y’all should unsubscribe if you are, “Do not recommend this channel”…and find a podcaster you trust for your news imo. Love you all! Go vote!"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"TRUMP….
a ridiculous but amusing person; a clown.
""they are simply incompetent buffoons who have no idea what they are doing"""
5EBGhSqj8k0,Perfect job for him.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Except his cult members (yes you, you're in a cult) have seemingly forgotten how a comedian his campaign paid and vetted just called the island of Puerto Rico ""floating garbage"" 2 days ago. Please continue with your fake outrage and lying through your non-existent teeth. You should all be shipped to an island by yourselves with no food or water, and no, not Puerto Rico."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Im black and I love this guy ❤❤
5EBGhSqj8k0,I like how ABC talked over trump saying “Joe Biden called us garbage”
5EBGhSqj8k0,Does the truck says Puerto Rico?  We don’t love you.  Thank you for the kitchen towels.
5EBGhSqj8k0,He is a legend!!

5EBGhSqj8k0,How can you not love this man
5EBGhSqj8k0,"A week ago, the swing states ended with Trump's victory, shouting drill-drill-drill and accompanying the American people to the hurricane-stricken areas. However, this time, Trump's truck show is of interest in whether Trump will surpass Harris in the overall vote show. Harris is not only incompetent, but also increased inflation and illegal criminals. A leader must protect the people's property (against inflation and economic risk) and safety (against border problem, natural disaster, terrorism, war). Trump, who shouted America First, is America's last hope."
5EBGhSqj8k0,You go Mr Trump many blessings to you sir 🙏🙏🙏

5EBGhSqj8k0,"He’s in the right truck, just the wrong end.  It amazes me why he has to use these elementary school props.  This man is running for President of the United States.  Biden called the hack comedian at the Trump rally garbage."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"This dude (Trump) COULDN'T WAIT TO DIVIDE  US FURTHER by jumping on a flub by Biden (or Harris) which Biden already clarified (my understanding was that he was calling the Trump supporters ""garbage"" who spoke at MSG using extremely vulgar and racial comments). Trump can't resist being hateful and divisive. And he NEVER TAKES ANY ACCOUNTABILITY for anything even though the jokes at his rally were vetted and even one was removed about Kamala because it was vulgar. What a joke Trump is. KAMALA WILL RISE ABOVE THIS!!!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,The imagery shouldn’t be lost on us. He’s hauling a bunch of garbage in his campaign

Great way to go!!🎉"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"This is absolutely great. THIS is what we need, not anyone from the least tolerant party who spouts anti-semitic Hitler and Nazi talk, censors and uses lawfare against anyone who disagrees with them, gaslights, lies straight to your face about everything, and follows an ideology barely a shade away from insanity.

The biggest Trump campaigners are the Democrats themselves. Nobody wants to be like that."
5EBGhSqj8k0,AhhhhHAHAH FRIGGIN CLASSIC!!! THIS IS MY PRESIDENT!!!🥰🥰🥰

5EBGhSqj8k0,Dumpster Fire
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Your bias is showing. Anyone can tell that’s a garbage truck from a mile away. You tried to cut the back of the truck out so it wouldn’t look like a garbage truck, but your camera man slipped for a split second and we could see the garbage lifters in the back. Also, other news outlets showed the whole truck. I guess you hope no one will watch any other outlets. It’s really sad that we trust ABC anymore."
5EBGhSqj8k0,trump cultist are so weird man. How are you all laughing and impressed that this bafoon is in a political prop acting like he's doing something?

5EBGhSqj8k0,Any chance that OLD don can be put in the REAR of the Truck?
5EBGhSqj8k0,Oh wow. Trump is a consequential president indeed 😂😂😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,"I think you guys are preparing the ground for possibly stealing the election again that’s why you keep asking if he will accept the results of the election if he loses. There better not be another black out during the election again. I am you guys will try something else this time around. I hope republicans will stay vigilant and watch you all like a hawk, so evidence of theft is not destroyed and then, claim there’s no evidence of fraud. Any fraud should be contested."
5EBGhSqj8k0,😂 and this is what he calls owning the libs? You can not be serious right now? Yeah....he really stuck it to them alright!! 🤦🙄😂

5EBGhSqj8k0,"This is about as good as the Mcdonald's segment, taking questions off script from reporters.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"I was thinking about this comment today. About why we are a nation in decline. My father’s wealth declined after the communists took the money from his family. But he moved to america and after forty years achieved the same level of wealth as his family had in china. His family is of scholars and governmental officials. My moms family is peasant but not unemployed. They belong to a traveling minstrelsy group. However if you take a family from south america and put them in america they will be unable to become rich because theyve been unemployed and poor for many generations. Therefore, when they say the border is ‘not vetted” its because poor people who have been poor for many generations are coming into america illegally."

He's in the wrong part of the truck. 
Bye Trump.
See you in four years from a nursing home/hospice/prison facility directing mass violence because you can't handle losing another election. 
😂.
He will be running again in four years, guaranteed. He is maga's god, savior, and almighty master. They cannot comprehend ever living another minute if they can't dedicate absolutely everything in their life to the promulgation of their cult mentality and support of a dictatorship.
😂."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump looks absolutely terrible 😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,"What is he trying to prove? Volunteering at a McDonalds fry station for a few hrs and riding as a passenger on garbage truck does not qualify as having a job in those occupations, and it most certainly does not give the complete experience of ones livlihood from working in those occupations. Like for real, what is the meaning of all of this?"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Genius! 
Master troll. Exactly what the democrats deserve. Get out and vote people!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is a Dotard. Only a fool would support this 🤡

5EBGhSqj8k0,"That's where he belong, he is garbage"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Kinda ironic him being in that garbage truck, but then again I ain't a politician 😂❤"
5EBGhSqj8k0,This is not genius. This just shows how simple minded the majority of American population is. As Americans you should feel ashamed and embarrassed that he is a Presidential candidate. The world is laughing at you America. If only you could see it.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Finally, Trump is in his comfort zone.
He belongs near garbage. Dump Trump."
5EBGhSqj8k0,He does have a way of winning a person over

5EBGhSqj8k0,He looks like a GARBAGE SCOW.   I didn't mean to say Trump should be hauling garbage. I meant to say that it should be hauled away AS garbage.
5EBGhSqj8k0,SMDH.....the absolute undeniable lies he just spoke up about inside Diaper Donnies garbage truck regarding the unbelievable lovefest that Puerto Ricans have for him after he alone saved an entire island nation from the devistation of a major hurricane just enrages me that much more.
5EBGhSqj8k0,TRUMP IS GARBAGE
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Such lies...from you of course, not Trump."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Finally he admits it
5EBGhSqj8k0,"ABC always with the lies ,, all the donations and AD from USA to Puerto Rico for the hurricane Maria the government of Puerto Rico putt all this products,  also water,  paper towels,  and baby formula and diapers on big  storages for years , and went the puertorrican people find out they went nutss , not coming to say something different,  because Trump putt part of his administration to help Puerto Rico with the money , because the politicians on Puerto Rico they been stilling the money for decades,  and the money to the keep the electrical grip on good shape they stole and now the whole electrical system is messed,  Elon Musk trying to help Puerto Rico with this problem and they denied the offer , the problem is not the people of Puerto Rico,,, is the politicians on the island,  and Puerto Rico is screaming for decades about this problem and on one way or other,  the name of Puerto Rico going to have a history on this fight that probably the puertorrican are the key for this election,  and this make me proud"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Love that guy!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is a genius
5EBGhSqj8k0,You know people need to look past their nose Donald Trump don't need our money and most of the billionaires pay their taxes pay their taxes pay their taxes. He doesn't take any money for doing the job of president all $1 because he has to. Warren Buffett if all the billionaires would pay their taxes like he did 5 billion we wouldn't need no social security tax or any other kind of tax if they would pay their fair share and the billionaires Club there's one that does pay his fair share of taxes and I'm sure that Elon Musk pays his fair share you need to look a little bit deeper and how intelligent intelligence of the man and how he knows how to turn some money into more money that's the difference these idiots that believe in Kamala Harris are buying into rotten apple that you ain't going to get the taste out of your mouth. Trump's the only hope we got to put this country back on its tracks. He knows more than what he says what you hear him saying all of what he knows. God Bless the USA and God bless Trump and God bless us with him being our next president it will be World War III if he's not watch and you'll have Civil War in the United States just like it tells in the Bible the world will be destroyed by fire and there's already countries fighting all over the world Jesus is on his way back
5EBGhSqj8k0,"He will make sure to entertain you and make the whole world laugh at you. 😅

5EBGhSqj8k0,Lmfao
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Mexico did not pay for the wall. No coal jobs are back. No great healthcare promised nor infrastructure from the so-called builder. Three time farm bailouts and tariff disasters that consumers only are paying today. Inept covid operations that shut down our country,  disrupted the supply chain with massive loss of lives by Felon 45. Ignoring our own intel for 4 years over Russian cyber attacks by 45 cost our companies millions in ransom today. Alienating our allies and trying to dismantle NATO was doing Putin's playbook. Dictator worship with love letters left us the laughing stock of the world. Instructing his Sycophants to attack our Capitol while injuring our Capitol Police while spreading feces in our Capitol Building. Disparaging our military, Fascism of Project 2025. Rovember 2024. Trump was NEVER the leader of the FREE world. Merkle stepped up"
5EBGhSqj8k0,👍👍👍
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is just loves to insult people even in the most subtle way! He was totally aware of the things the comedian was going to puke outta his mouth! Along with all the other speakers that nite! It was very eye opening to many people ! 😊

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Lowe. TRUMP. ALWAS. 
Mano. Nersesyane.."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump was NEVER the leader of the FREE world.  Merkle stepped up.  Three Generals all working under Felon 45 have stated he is fascists and unfit. Kelly, Milley and Mattis. 44 of his past administration are not supporting him. Yes  Trump lives in fear, mongering lies for Cult 45 still worshipping their Lord and Loser Felon 45. The Nobel economists yesterday reported his deportation and tariff disasters would tank our economy. Those good ole days under 45 were refrigerator morgue trucks in our streets. The light, next the bleach and it will be over in two weeks. Telling Bob Woodward on tape that he knew covid was deadly and lied to the American people for 3 months. Placing former Secretary of Pay to Play Jared and his college buddies over the supply chain was a over two year clean up disaster with price hikes. They were all inept in operations and with massive loss of lives by 45."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Such soft hands

Now can we all stop being 12! Everyone go read your freaking facts and come to some sound decisions red or blue but based on facts not a schoolyard word fight… uck sorry for the 12–yr-old reference I didn’t mean to insult them they seem to have more sense then the adults today.

He didn’t have a hair or hat or whatever the hell that is on top of his head was getting into the food. Lol!"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"She Didn't tell the truth. President Trump DIDN'T HOLD BACK AID from Puerto Rico. The Democratic Mayor in Puerto Rico held back the, Aid. They even found plates  and plates of hiden Water that was sent over there. And they lied, was trying to say President Trump wasn't sending Aid.

5EBGhSqj8k0,God safe you life Mr president 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Literally all Trump did was sit in a truck. He didn’t even drive it. Not sure what the big deal is about. It really shows just how much of a cult is behind Trump, they worship him for literally just sitting. Is anyone really going to vote for him because of (lame) publicity stunts instead of voting off of policy? If you want to make America great again, then don’t vote for the guy who has cheated on his wives and who has never told a truth in his life."

5EBGhSqj8k0,"AMERICANS MUST VOTE FOR CANDIDATES OF TRUTH 2024  ??
America, the abundant, the place I was born
I'll cherish till the day I die.
Where the bones of past heroes lie buried in the ground
Who loved her the same as I.

Her mountains are so tall they reach for the sky
With prairies where the green grasses grow.
There's billions of trees where wild birds nest
With creatures that flourish below.

That blue gold called water with which we are blessed
As raindrops or crystallized snow
Changes to rivers and fresh water lakes
While the winds of our seasons blow.

Some cities have buildings a hundred stories tall
Structures of concrete, glass and steel.
A statue in a harbor, a present from France
Describes how inside, we feel.

That flag on the moon with red and white stripes
Proves America’s dreams come true.
A country of heroes who line up to protect
The past, the present and few.

Now’s not the time to fight one another
Or kiss our enemy’s cheek.
All through history it remains the same
The strong enslave the weak.

May God continue to bless America
Refusing evil the upper hand.
It’s up to us to stay resolute
Defending the liberty of Man.

Politicians who wish to be praised by history
Must earn their fame by living the truth.
Any who continue to mislead and deceive
Must be shunned by the voter at the booth.

At this point everything is just a joke and calling each other names on both sides. You have actors, comedians,singers, and all kinds of people in the elections that don't even matter in this. The list goes on and on. Is this really what we want for our country? Americans fighting Americans. It will be better off if there isn't a president at this point."

5EBGhSqj8k0,Who wants to bet the truck is brand new and has never picked up trash before. I highly doubt Trump would set foot in a garbage truck that smelled bad
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Wisconsin, not North Carolina. I hope Trump repeals the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 and all msm is held to account for the havoc they have bequeathed upon the citizenry of America."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Loser in that garbage truck

5EBGhSqj8k0,garbage hauling garbage... how befitting.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Biden said his supporters were garbage and now he’s riding around in a garbage truck 😂

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Hey, ABC, you are all hacks. You are the human garbage."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"5:32 Finally, he's where he belongs.  Except,  he's in the wrong part of the truck."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is way too funny. Nice that we can laugh….❤️
5EBGhSqj8k0,I love it! He's leading in most swing states! Trump is Pro America! Dems are closeted racist. This is a sick photo op!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Visit any Trump hotel, like Trump Tower in Chicago. Witness folks of many races & ethnicities working for Trump. Supporting themselves and their families from jobs provided by Trump."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"ABC lying and distorting as always. I don't know who this woman is, but she is a liar. The only reason any funding was interrupted was because the GOVT of that district REFUSED TO PROVIDE PROOF of where the money was going! And the people were suffering because the GOVT was not providing the funds provided by the USA!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Damn trump are you this much desperate 😢
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's in the right place.He just needs to go ahead and climb on in the back
5EBGhSqj8k0,That’s funny!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"🤦🤣 Donald Trump, wearing his makeup looks like his vest 🟠"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Yes because nothing says you’re sorry like driving a garbage truck after calling the US and PR a garbage dump. 

The stable genius never knows nuttin about nuttin. 

#CosaNostra"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Your next President, Donald Trump!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Claro que los aguanto si el gobierno de PR se lo estaban robando yo soy testigo y lo que se robó fema que nunca pago lo que tenia que pagar luego de recibir los fondo
5EBGhSqj8k0,And why did he delay funding? Because the Puerto Rican government couldn’t be trusted with it. The news forgot to mention the fact that they found warehouses filled with undistributed emergency supplies. Trump sent $50 billion over there and it was completely mismanaged.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Bro bro, he looks good sitting in that trash truck..fitting."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Look up it's a bird no it's a plane no it's Trump the garbage man. My hero. On the job to the rescue. 💪🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 America.🇱🇷🇱🇷
5EBGhSqj8k0,This is Genius!
5EBGhSqj8k0,This is the most he will ever get to middle class working ppl. All stage let see him get out and empty  some trash cans.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both seem to be playing roles in what feels like a soft Hegelian dialectic, where differing sides push for policies that serve the same underlying interests. Kamala's focus on increasing immigration could be seen as an attempt to bring in more workers to fuel the economy. However, adding more 'new cows' (immigrants and refugees) might only deepen national debt, especially if corruption siphons off funds meant for real growth into endless foreign conflicts. On the other hand, Trump’s emphasis on tariffs may seem logical for a wealthy businessman who doesn’t feel the financial strain, but for struggling Americans who face rising costs without the same safety nets, tariffs just add to their burden. Not every American has the security of a union job, and many feel left out of this ‘United States,’ where the wealthiest benefit from tax breaks while others carry the load. Is this really the 'united' America the founders envisioned? The idea that military power and spending can create a bright future feels misplaced. History shows us that empires, from Alexander’s to Rome's, ultimately crumbled when they overspent and overextended. As we face mounting debt, why should we believe the outcome will be any different now? Investing in our people, reducing debt, and focusing on peace seem far better ways forward if we truly want a united and prosperous nation."
5EBGhSqj8k0,It's a garbage truck ABC News... Because Biden call over half of America n TRUMP supporters garbage.  BTW... Not on North Carolina.  He's in Wisconsin.  Get your facts right .... Can't trust the news anymore.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"ABC news never gonna get my respect ever again, theyve spewed out so much disinformation and propaganda its crazy"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Fact check you dumb mfers‼️‼️‼️ ITS A FUCKING GARBAGE TRUCK

5EBGhSqj8k0,Bahahaha thats why im voting for Trump. He is in a garbage truck.😂😂😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is hauling Biden's garbage out.. 🤣🤣
5EBGhSqj8k0,So a speaker at one of his events calls Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage and his response is to drive a garbage truck. Well if you wanted to be a hateful troll this is the way to do it.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Pure Gold I tell ya...GOLD!
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's sitting in the wrong seat.  His spot's in the back.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump should be in the back of the truck with the rest of the garbage. What a loser!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"A Press Conference !
What a Concept !
Go Trump !!!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Dump Trump?
5EBGhSqj8k0,"If Trump believes in the working class so much, how come he wont pay all those contractors he owes $$$ to? Fraudster !!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,What's he picking up? Puerto Rico?
5EBGhSqj8k0,You forgot the garbage truck … i honour of Bidens comment 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
5EBGhSqj8k0,LEFT SCUM WILL CHEAT LIKE HELL - ITS NOT EVEN AN ARGUMENT - PLEASE
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Hysterical that the least relatable person in human history is now trying so hard to seem relatable. . . . . Cuz arrogant dishonest chest-pounding billionaire criminal insurrectionist hate-spewing false-Christian false-patriot p***y-grabbing New Yorkers are so relatable to us “regular” Americans.    Hmmm, McDonalds?   Check.   Garbage truck?   Check.   Porn star paying?   Check.    Hmmmm, I wonder what’s next between now and next Tuesday.   Maybe going to the Motor Vehicle building for the car he’s never driven?   Maybe to the makeup store for more pallets of orange makeup?   Can’t wait to see his next “relatable” trick."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Finally someone took Trump out to the Trash
5EBGhSqj8k0,What a moron! The news needs to stop covering these antics as if it's a normal presidential campaign tactics!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,I went to work at McDonald’s now I am going to get a job driving a garbage truck!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Puerto Rico has a trash/garbage problem for real. Read the article below.
5EBGhSqj8k0,That’s the problem with America. The working people are treated like garbage. Inflation has outpaced wages 2 to 1....
5EBGhSqj8k0,Hahah Trump trolling from a garbage truck… let’s go Brandon
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Don’t let Kamala pull the wool over your eyes. Kamala has not been able to make the case as to how she would fix the economy and secure the border even with friendly networks like The View and CNN. Kamala is now resorting to name calling and paying musicians to attend her rallies and lying about Trump’s positions. Trump said he will not sign an abortion ban and never said that he would change Social Security benefits. In fact, Trump said there would be no tax on social security overtime or tips.

Kamala wants US taxpayers to pay housing and health care for 21 million unvetted migrants and will sign a bill to allow 2 million more in per year. Waltz jokes, he will invest in a ladder company so unvetted migrants could scale the wall. Under Trump there was an executive order, Remain In Mexico, at no cost to taxpayers, it did not allow unvetted migrants to cross the border. Harris and Biden decided on day one of their administration not to follow the remain in Mexico Order and allowed unvetted migrants to flood the border. They are actually flying migrants throughout the country essentially making every State a Border State. 

Kamala’s high corporate taxes, price fixing plan and tax on capitol gains will cause international business to leave the US for countries that have a low cooperate taxes like, Ireland. Trump will give a lower cooperate tax rate only to businesses that manufacture in the US and will put reciprocal tariffs only on countries that put tariffs on goods exported from the United States. 

Under Trump 2016 to 2020 inflation was low, prices were reasonable and the border and globe were more secure because Trump would not hesitate to pick up the phone to speak to world leaders whereas Kamala has avoided the PM of Israel and did not show for a Catholic Benefit and her co- chair mocked the sacrament of communion with Doritos, (Kamala’s favorite)."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Kamala is so cooked 😂😂😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,anyone that cant see this guy is senile is willfully ignorant.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump having the time of his life boy🤣
5EBGhSqj8k0,she looks tired
5EBGhSqj8k0,If this isn’t the best metaphor for his campaign.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Ahhh...Finally Trump in a garbage truck...How Fitting!!!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Another photo op hahaha after mcdonald’s . Yuck!!!!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"C-I-À news puppets are fuming. Can’t even spin the stories anymore lol the people awake was always their greatest fear. 
Go ahead steal it from Trump. The people are ready! Military is ready"
5EBGhSqj8k0,I'm cracking up!!! Way to go Mr President Trump sir
5EBGhSqj8k0,No he was not criticized for withholding funding who was criticized was the mayor hiding all the equipment that was sent over there in a warehouse and then going on national TV and lying
5EBGhSqj8k0,I thought the garbage was supposed to go in the back of the truck.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Scum media liars exposed

5EBGhSqj8k0,"He's not in NC. He's in Green Bay, Wisconsin."

5EBGhSqj8k0,You got me excited. I thought they finally picked up this piece of garbage
5EBGhSqj8k0,"He's looking for a new line of work, because he's bombing in this election."

5EBGhSqj8k0,In a garbage truck? That's appropriate for #LoserTrump and his claims that America is a garbage can! 🙃
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump should be in the back with the other garbage!
5EBGhSqj8k0,I love this guy...😂

5EBGhSqj8k0,What a joke. Acting like he is working . He is so out of touch with regular hard working people. Wake up Trump supporters. He doesn't give a damn about you unless you're rich
5EBGhSqj8k0,He can't have an actual conversation about policy so all he can do is silly stunts for the camera
5EBGhSqj8k0,Lies!!!!!!!!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"I love Trump. If the media didn't attack him and paint everything he does as evil because they're owned by 5 globalists, people would see how much he loves this country. Kamala is an owned and controlled  puppet. Trump is his own man, and he's for America, and that's why they hate him. But most people get home at 5 and listen to the news, and that's all they know."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Sometimes the jokes write themselves
5EBGhSqj8k0,lol 😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump didn'tknow cohen his personal lawyer he didn't know esteine now he dont know the comedian

5EBGhSqj8k0,Finally Donald Trump is back in the trash truck where his garbage ass belongs
5EBGhSqj8k0,"If these “journalists” did any work they would see that in Georgia alone, one county can’t account for or give a reason for LOST 380,000 ballots."
5EBGhSqj8k0,He HATES Puerto Rico...lying pos
5EBGhSqj8k0,The Jokes write themselves now of days

5EBGhSqj8k0,What a farce!
5EBGhSqj8k0,So tone deaf. Really unbelievable.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"There they go fact, checking again. He was too slow with funds to Puerto Rico, so she says. Also, she doesn’t know that’s a garbage truck. What a moron."

5EBGhSqj8k0,Hes the best!  Such a great sense of humor - love it!!!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Wow, now that's some real trash talk"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Oh look, he's personally arranging for transportation for his cult members."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump literally just called America the Garbage Can of the World.  It seems a little weird to have all this drama over Biden throwing his rhetoric back at him.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"The woke DEI-hire reporter refused to say it was a garbage truck when it was obvious as soon as you saw the purpose built box on the back you know it's a garbage truck. But they made sure not to show that until after being forced to admit it was a garbage truck.

What's impressive is that Trump predicted correctly that she was hiding the fact - & forced her to admit it - at which point she panned back rapidly & did so in a way the partially obscured the primary characteristics that make it stand out as a garbage truck, so obscured the iconic feature, (the shape of the box & the trusses it's made of, that it did not appear as obviously a garbage truck like the same one that we saw from a different angle & zoomed out so you could see the whole thing - it was unmistakably a garbage truck. 

The thing is it was so insidiously detailed that it's super obvious the crew that shot this has been lying for news casters for a long time. Someone there really has the details down about how to film propaganda for psy-ops. Meaning of course, that these guys lie with video on a level of detail that only video experts can describe."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Exactly where he belongs! In the trash.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Traitor boy is in the wrong end of the truck
5EBGhSqj8k0,with the trash where he belongs
5EBGhSqj8k0,What a pandering POS.  Our nation is fine and will be better when we dont have to listen to your sheet.
5EBGhSqj8k0,You're such a fake news company
5EBGhSqj8k0,He belongs in the back with the rest of the putrid trash
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's got a little problem for himself 😂😂😂

5EBGhSqj8k0,Desperate and so fake
5EBGhSqj8k0,haha Gotta love Trump! and if you don't you probably got a pickle up your bu**
5EBGhSqj8k0,"You know who’s winning by who is having the most fun. While Kamala Harris gets booed at her own rallies, everyday, Trump endears himself to the American people through humor."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Douche extraordinaire.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Because of Biden Harris the last 4 years has been garbage
5EBGhSqj8k0,what a dump trump😂😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,Wow! Got the leftist media losing their mind! Well they can join the trash !
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Show the video of him stumbling,  having problems walking and getting into the truck.  He has major health issues, beyond his mental ones."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump has to take care of all the trash that Biden Harris have littered the country.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Hats off for ABC...nice
5EBGhSqj8k0,He took care of Puerto Rico by throwing paper towels
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Comedian had nothing to do with Trump. He wasn't even there when it happened. But the comedian wasn't wrong. Puerto Rico is ran by Democrats and after the hurricanes and other disasters, it is a mess..  still trash and debris.. just like every Dem city and state...Go look for yourself"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"we have a president that is going to due A great job. and for you, naysayers Just look at the last 4 years. And if you can't understand what's been going on is wrong for America and its families. then there's no way to help a person like yourself. And those people are not stupid.

5EBGhSqj8k0,He is so fake.. How can he look at himself on television and be proud of himself!? To say everyone loves him after disrespecting them proves to me he doesn’t have integrity behind the scenes!

5EBGhSqj8k0,I'm Puerto Rican. Trump's response to the hurricane was fast and very wide. The local government was democrat and was openly sabotaging the help and assistance because he called their corruption. Lots of food and supplies were stolen or lost by the incompetence of the local government.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"He's not even worthy of being near that truck, unless he is in it as garbage!"

Joe biden said something last night that millions of people are talking about today but abc news is standing next to a GARBAGE truck today interviewing trump about a comic and they don't seem to want to report on joes comment. I wonder what joe said about millions of Americans ? Something smells

5EBGhSqj8k0,Is he taking out the Puerto Rican garbage from Pennsylvania?
5EBGhSqj8k0,"OUTSTANDING  , AND  VERY PROFESSIONAL AND VERY  VICTORIOUS  , MR. ERIC M COOK."
5EBGhSqj8k0,France is smaller and we have more time zones.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump 24, he can bring most of us together. Not all because some are brainwashed that he's racist. Look at his history"
5EBGhSqj8k0,King of the troll!!!😂😂😂😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump did take care of PR in 2018! Hurricane Maria happened in 2017 and Obama was president then and for months PR had no water or electricity and Trump sent a large amount of aid once he became president in 2018.  Hes not lying when he said he helped them.  Our food bank recieved funds to collect aid for PR Trumps orders!  Trump couldnt withhold funds in 2017 as he was not the President get the facts straight reporters please....its so easy to fact check you and you just sound uneducated when you blatantly lie!!!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Lmao what is his strategy here.  Did he realize that no one can relate to a billionaire with a literal gold toilet inside a tower named after himself or did he realize that having only concepts of policies leaves him nothing to campaign on other than hate and doom.  Can't wait for this week to be over so I can ignore him on my newsfeed forever.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Proud to be a Trump piece of "" garbage"" supporter. TRUMP/VANCE ❤"

5EBGhSqj8k0,Legend TRUMP 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,"France - 38 million votes to count.
U.S.A. - potentially, more than 160 million votes to count, in a multitude of state election laws whereby same day votes must be counted first, signaling a “Red Wave,” and then the mail-in and absentee ballots are counted after the same day ballots, negating the “Red Wave” in many states…
Don’t get this wrong. Trump will prematurely attempt to claim “victory,” just like he tried to do in Nov. 2020…."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Beautiful
5EBGhSqj8k0,Names will never hurt us! A garbage truck Beautiful 😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Is she joking?  First lying saying its just a truck, then say ""Donld Trump ""says"" its a garbage truck"".  What?  You blind or just dumb?  Clearly can see its a garbage truck.  And Trump did not delay funding for hurricane maria.  It was HUD that wanted to investigate first.  He even sent the floating hospitals down there to help with over $23B"

So what happened to that cocaine that was found in the White House? 😆 🤣 😂 our tax money to help all the illegals and other countries except our own. It's pathetic that our heroes of war have to beg for money 💰 on the streets. It's a disgrace to American families  who have to work 3 jobs to pay their rent, daycare, and food. Not to mention their cars, insurance, gas, and more taxes to keep their cars! 
Oh, Lord, have mercy."

One guest in Trump Rally said the island is a garbage island, never mentioned the people were garbage, similar to when you say San Francisco is a garbage city (dirty and messy), but was completely distorted by mainstream media as an attack to the people. At the same time, Biden said trump's supporters are garbage, exactly words by words, but the mainstream media explained is that this is only to the one guest. WTF?! Didn't Biden use a plural and attack all Trump's supporters. This baised reporting is so disgusting."

5EBGhSqj8k0,Someone should have showed the showman how a door handle works and maybe practiced going up a few steps before hand.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Did you notice that he said “I don’t think the military will have to be used.” as if it’s a possibility. This is a much more consequential gaffe than anything Biden said.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Joe just as simple as Kamala - but I think Kamala does not answer much - she cannot even comment about charges that Trump is a despot of the worse kind in history - sick reporting of events on Left Wing Media
5EBGhSqj8k0,Show the full video of him stumbling!
5EBGhSqj8k0,He should’ve done the interview from the back of the truck. Where he belongs.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Remember God the Heavenly father said:

Make sure that no one is repaying anyone evil with evil.
1 PETER 2:16
Live as free people but do not use your freedom to cover up evil.
1 PETER 3:9
Do not repay anyone evil with evil or insults with insults.
ROMANS 12:17-19
Do not repay anyone evil with evil. Do what is right in the eyes of everyone. As far as it depends on you. Live in peace, with everyone.  Do not take revenge into your own hands. Leave room for God the Heavenly father wrath. For it is written revenge is mine says the LORD God Almighty.  If your enemies are hungry GIVE them something to eat and if they are thirsty GIVE them something to drink. 
LUKE 6:35 
Love your enemies, do good by them and lend to them without expecting anything back from them.and your rewards will be great in heaven and you will be called the children of God the Heavenly father. 

Why are people repaying evil with evil and insults with insults?
Why are people killing and murdering one other. When God the Heavenly father said; DO NOT KILL OR COMMIT MURDER.

DAILY ALL I SEE IS SINFUL LUSTFUL VIOLENT WICKED EVIL GREEDY LYING.
MATTHEW 10:10
Your own enemies will be in your own household.

I have a feeling, that One day someone is going to kill and murder me. 
Because I don't see myself dying of a peaceful old age.  
No one likes to hear the truth.

You will be hated by everyone because of me, 

People do kill and murder people who teaches the truth. 
We live in a violent wicked evil world. Where we are turning on one other.

5EBGhSqj8k0,Omg.. First McDonald's and now this?
5EBGhSqj8k0,Dudes trolling so hard...  This ia awesome. Trump 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Elon is an immigrant - perhaps he is OK because he is white and rich! - also if you actually were working on a garbage truck you wouldn’t wear a white shirt, total BS."
5EBGhSqj8k0,He belongs in the back of that truck.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump is the man. I’ve never voted in my 32 years of life sir ans this year I’m coming out to vote for you. Get this country back on track brother. Much love Trump2024. 
Notice how the media will leave out details to try to make trump look as bad as possible or just flat out lie on him. It’s sad and I don’t know how it’s legal."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Hes a troll.....and I love it 😅😅😅
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Senior citizen has the proof of all the stolen election and classified documents in the truck 😅  

Guy, we know you don't lift a finger, your Republican employees, and Generals think your a fascist and you still think you won 2020.

Though this would be a great job for him in the future."
5EBGhSqj8k0,The female Abc news reporters is a liar he did send funds to pr😮
5EBGhSqj8k0,"ABC, it's not just a truck...it's a garbage truck.  Get your facts straight"
5EBGhSqj8k0,ABC is a fake news
5EBGhSqj8k0,Lol is he taking himself out with the rest of the trash?
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's pretending to work again like a three year old
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Reporter can't help herself, lying by omission, letting you believe he's insulting his opponents. He's in a garbage truck in response to Biden calling Trump supporters garbage."
5EBGhSqj8k0,End this madness! To my American friends: Vote Trump for World Peace 🇺🇸 MAGA
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump is taking out the real trash that is Kamala and Joe Biden. 🗑 Thank you, Mr. President!
Vote For Trump 2024 ❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸❤"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"""He's a comedian. What more can I tell you!""
-- Let's Make Humour Great Again."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"TRUMP RACIST HATE - Donald Trump praises Adolf Hitler, and if elected, he wants his Generals to be like Hitler's Generals. Over 40 high-level professionals who worked closely with Trump while he was President tell you he is a real peril to the future of society. He says he will use the military to go after Americans, and that could be you!

NOW YOUR VOICE - Make your voice heard by voting for Kamala Harris because she is intelligent, strong, and has empathy for all Americans!

TRUMP CLIMATE DENIER - You and I will have more pollution. Donald Trump killed over 100 critical climate change programs while he was President of the United States and pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Peace Accord. Historians state that Trump has damaged climate change more than any other person. If he wins, he says he will drill, baby, drill.

TRUMP CRIMES AND THE NUCLEAR CODES - Donald Trump is a convicted felon 34 times. Trump is indicted for January 6, stolen top-secret documents, Georgia, and his other crimes. Trump will have the nuclear codes if he wins. Stop! You cannot let this happen! Vote for Kamala Harris!

TRUMP DICTATOR ON DAY ONE - He says he will be a dictator on day one, bringing in Project 2025. Americans should not be voting for a convicted felon, a business fraudster, an adjudicated rapist.

TRUMP BORDERS - Trump called his Republican friends not to vote for the Bipartisan Border Bill. That bill, negotiated by both sides and had broad bipartisan support until former President Trump decided it would be more helpful for Republicans to have problems at the border as a campaign issue than fix the issue. The bill included: 
🔵An automatic shutdown of the border when crossings are too high
🔵2,700 new Border Patrol & ICE agents
🔵100 fentanyl inspection machines
🔵100 new immigration judges
🔵4,300 new asylum officers 
It would have been the most comprehensive border immigration bill in years. Donald Trump killed it so he could have something to run on and lie and lie to his gullible supporters. QUESTION: When does the word gullible turn into the word stupid?

NOW YOUR VOICE - Make your voice heard by voting for Kamala Harris because she is intelligent, strong, and has empathy for all Americans!
........."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Show the full video of Trump nearly falling 😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,Did he just say…he doesn’t know who the comedian was? 😅 The comedian who was on his stage at his rally telling racist jokes to his supporters… 🤥

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Ooh, impressive-- not!  As so often happens, Donald Trump's smear (the garbage truck) is more reflective of himself.  I have full respect for garbage collection and collectors, by the way; it's Donald Trump who is denigrating it"

5EBGhSqj8k0,Hilarious troll!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"trump is full of it....and ABC did not call him out..the only thing he did for PR during Hurricane Maria was insult the Puerto Ricans by throwing a few paper towels at them.  He withheld millions of dollars for their relief and refused their FEMA Applications. Of course, he knew about the ""comedian"" who insulted Puerto Ricans...he was on the teleprompter.  NB/Note Bene/ Notice:  the convicted  felon did not apologize but only lied by insisting  he did so much for PR and lying, ""they love me and I love them"".  
Shame on ABC!"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Donald Trump: Promises vs. Reality

• Promised to cut the deficit but added $8 trillion to it.

• Promised to build a wall; completed only 458 miles out of 2,000, mostly repairs.

• Promised Mexico would pay for the wall; they didn’t.

• Promised a new healthcare plan; it never existed.

• Promised a middle-class tax cut; primarily cut taxes for the rich, leaving the middle class to bear the burden.

• Promised not to play golf; made 250 visits to his own golf clubs, costing taxpayers $150 million.

• Promised to increase economic growth by 4,5,6%; didn’t achieve 3% but once, President Biden did.

• Promised an infrastructure plan; had none, President Biden signed a massive one.

• Promised to hire “the best people”; fired 3/4 of them, then labeled them the worst.

• Promised to reduce prescription drug prices; didn’t happen, President Biden did.

• Promised to win the trade war with China; it cost about a quarter million jobs and $36 Billion to bailout Farmers"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"1. Biden didn't say this.
2. The media is evil for perpetuating this story for clicks days before an election. 
3. Trump and anyone who has ever voted for him know inside they are garbage.

How you live matters - voting for a carpetbagger who will demonize an octogenarian possibly suffering from early stage dementia just to have the power to avoid jail at the expense of America's literal survival automatically makes you human garbage too."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Garbage truck?  He should be riding in the back, not the cab."

5EBGhSqj8k0,the garbage is in the truck
5EBGhSqj8k0,"I say this jokingly, if president trump really wants to reach undecided voters by doing everyday jobs he should scrub toilets in one of the 5 star hotels we are paying to house illegals. Any man willing to clean taco turds off of expensive porcelain gets my vote."

5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump will bring back 1929 hawley moot act which will bring US into a depression worse than ever
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Kamala-Biden is responsible for the following crisis facing America today:


1.  High Inflation

2.  High Taxes

3.  Defunding the Police

4.  High Crime Rate

5.  High Illegal Immigration

6.  Misuse of Federal Funds

7.  Collapse and Disaster During US Force Withdrawal from Afghanistan

8.  Low Priority for US Citizens Compared to Foreign Aid

9.  High National Deficit- More funding in Ukraine

10. Increased Hate and Discrimination Among Citizens"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Take out the paper and the trash, yackity yack, don't vote Kamala back, she talks smack  and takes our cash."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump tell your folks to stop targeting folks by cyber so that those who know that you are dangerous start to speak up. Y'all wake up do no vote for Trump. When he gets his pay held and money held for 12 days and gets his lights cut because their pay was held and their water line cut when executing their freedom of speech as a black woman. Not to mention a cop blowing minorities down in Charlotte on a 6 lane hwy with a rail way train separating the two three lanes of traffic and being told that she was being blown down for bright lights on in the day time with the traffic going in the opposite direction separated by train track. This targeting has escalated with every post on social media warning people not to vote for Trump. When a wicked ruler rules the people suffer. Have we ever seen a pandemic in the United States before and no one ever heard the term targeting until Trump came into office.
5EBGhSqj8k0,I want a troll as our president! Nice!

I don’t care who you vote for who you want to win. I do care if you propagate lies no matter on what party you are saying it against!

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump has got a GREAT sense of humor, he’s ALWAYS the same guy no matter where he is. People who don’t like him are fearful of AMERICA becoming GREAT AGAIN. So sad that Biden was KICKED out of office and she was “selected “ to be in the running. That’s NOT democracy! I think MORE women are having more trouble paying grocery bills, buying gas, feeling safe than are running to get abortions! GO TRUMP 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"The greatest American liar in history.
Can’t deny his success as a con man mind fogger. I’ve seen many but he’s the absolute best. Trump doesn’t leave things to handlers!
“Anything you do in this campaign better be ran by me first…..” Is how he thinks and everybody on his team knows it. 
To believe trump you would have to believe that his team would say
“Let’s put this comedian on stage at Madison Square Garden tonight. Trump doesn’t need to know. We’ll surprise him! He likes when we’re spontaneous.”
8 DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY.
Right"

5EBGhSqj8k0,Since you felt the need to say that he was criticized for holding back temporarily help to Puerto Rico. Did you also mention that you wanted to make sure it got to the people and not stolen or misappropriated? I bet you didn’t.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Love Trump 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump talks garbage from a garbage truck 
5EBGhSqj8k0,"So first he larped as a McDonald’s worker, now he’s leaping as a garbage truck driver? Is this photo op really fooling anybody? Surely even his supporters realize he doesn’t know how that machine actually works?"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Biased much?? No wonder the garbage doesn't like you anymore.
5EBGhSqj8k0,My man trump is just on side quests at this point
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's prepping for his community service after his criminal sentencing next month.
5EBGhSqj8k0,He is a liar!!!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Also was a volunteer firefighter for 18 years and receive the outstanding plaque for being the best in class!
5EBGhSqj8k0,It would be more à propos if he were speaking out of the back of the garbage truck
5EBGhSqj8k0,Now Harris should do her campaign off of the back of a truck delivering boxed wine and Xanax samples.
5EBGhSqj8k0,MAGA
5EBGhSqj8k0,Worthless media 😈
5EBGhSqj8k0,Nobody does anything better than me!  😅
5EBGhSqj8k0,Of course ABC would be cutting and pasting a fake video --- and posting it as truth.  Obviously a photo shot cut and past --- not even a good one.   This is the Leftist party --- nothing but lies and untruths---- and their followers are blind as can be.
5EBGhSqj8k0,This man is pulling a lot of things

5EBGhSqj8k0,So when Hinchcliffe said that there was a floating island of garbage. He was referring to all the supplies that were sent to PR in aid and were never used I believe. Which is pretty funny. Anyway.
5EBGhSqj8k0,He is sat in the wrong place. The back end is the rightful seat for this walking yuck.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump should have just jumped in the truck and said he doesn't have time for questions because he's got to go collect votes!   Then peel out of there burning rubber!  
5EBGhSqj8k0,What timeline is this 😂
5EBGhSqj8k0,No more Union Job after he gets elected.  Good luck with that.
5EBGhSqj8k0,He belongs in the garbage.

5EBGhSqj8k0,🐐
5EBGhSqj8k0,"He is in the wrong part of the truck. Where the trash goes.

If Trump gets elected half the nation is going to be upset about this. We are not going to start liking him for all the crap he has done in and outside of office.

Taiwan is also too important because they make important computer related stuff in Taiwan that we don't want to fall into Chinese hands.

I now know why Elon Musk bought Twitter. Because Donald Trump was banned and Elon Musk donated huge sums of Money to Donald Trumps campaign.

That was the only way Donald Trump could get unbanned."
5EBGhSqj8k0,It's funny because joe and Harris literally are garbage.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Haha 😂 this is hilarious.

I can’t even begin to imagine if George Carlin or Richard Pryor got up there the whole country would leave their minds just George Carlin’s list of racist comments which back then had so many laughs about it. You can’t laugh about anything anymore. I think Trump is absolutely brilliant from McDonald’s to the garbage truck!"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Why dont people think the government dumping garbage in the ocean is disturbing,  they preach global warming yet dump garbage in the oceans killing untold wildlife"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Bro. Brett Farve literally stole from the poor to give to his daughter. How is anyone supposed to take this guy seriously?
5EBGhSqj8k0,The vest does not complement his skin tone; the orange lunatic looks like a pumpkin from last year: disgusting and rotten to the core. …which would make his place in the back of the truck more suitable.
5EBGhSqj8k0,He’s in a garbage truck wants to protect elon and he loves Puerto Rico 😂😂 what a phony fake SOB
5EBGhSqj8k0,HE DRIVING A GARBAGE TRUCK TO ADMIT HE IS GARBAGE!!!!!!

Yep you took care of PR during the Hurricane throwing paper towels and withholding funding from Puerto Rico!!!!!  So, PR it’s time for y’all to step up and vote this crook out!!!!!  Sure he doesn’t know the comedian, he was vetted by DT staff.  His staff removed the “c” word from the comedians speech and ok’d the rest!  There is no way the secret service or his staff allowed anyone on that stage that DT didn’t know!!!!  SMDH"
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Aside all the BS and lies Trump says, what a vile thing he is, this reminds me of Kirk from Gilmore Girls. Worked every job possible. Trump is like a toddler wanting to be everything growing up. Next he will be a fireman for 5 mins."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Such a lyin' POS. 
If he didn't know the comedian, he wouldn't have invited him. 
He did squat for Puerto Rico. Tossing paper towels at the press crew does not constitute aid to Puerto Rico. He refused aid all together.
Especially after trash talking of Puerto Rico at the Madison Square Garden.
A boy in a mans body, loves the big trucks. What's next, a Zamboni in a hockey arena? 
This child-man is unfit for presidency! Too old, full on dementia!
All you Maga supporters, you know this to be true.

Kamala Harris for President 2024!"

5EBGhSqj8k0,Yeah you gave them 9 rolls of paper towels! So they could wipe up some of the water! They didn’t ever get electricity turned back on until Joe Biden was in the White House!!! It will take 100s of people counting paper ballots weeks to get the tally. He’s lying about the fact that he has nothing to do with comedian AT HIS OWN RALLY! 🤣😁😄😅

5EBGhSqj8k0,Machine can count a million ballots in hours and people can count a million ballots in many days. And this moron wants paper ballots.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"This is what’s called a press conference. Reporters ask questions and the candidate provides answers. The questions, topics, and who gets called on are NOT dictated in advance by the campaign staff. The candidate does not use cheat sheets, note cards, teleprompters, or handlers that scold, admonish, or stop the reporters."

5EBGhSqj8k0,❤
5EBGhSqj8k0,2024 is not real 😭🙏
5EBGhSqj8k0,"ABC News POS.  Absolutely disgusting propaganda!  Trump gave Puerto Ricco Billions immediately.  He responded and prepared to respond ahead of every hurricane.  In all of my many decades I never saw such effective hurricane responses from a President.  EVER.  The truth.  In order to make Trump look bad, the Democrat government of Puerto Ricco was more interested in engaging in a damage Trump campaign via staged crisis and propaganda.  It was the same as the Russia hoax, Schiff reading lies in the House re the Zelensky Impeachment.  It goes on and on.  It is always the same playbook.  Has been throughout the centuries.  The communist totalitarian playbook.  (Like Judge Kavanaugh really ran a train on a girl in high school - only the truly brainwashed believe that shite.)  The truth about Puerto Ricco is the government kept the supplies stored in a warehouse and away from the people.  They hurt the people to make Trump look bad.  Just like COVID in NY and the empty USNS Comfort which the media criticized Trump over saying it would never make it to NY - wrong.  Lies, Lies, Lies.  So say the colluding participants at ABC, MSNBC, CNN, CBC, et al. manage to escape very long prison sentences for their crimes against the American people.  It remains to be seen if they will be able to walk the streets in peace after the truth becomes widely accepted and obvious.  It is finally obvious to most."
5EBGhSqj8k0,He's in the wrong end of the truck!
5EBGhSqj8k0,Epic!  😂   Master Troller!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Someone should get Trump a dressup chest and take him to the children's museum to play/live out all these fantasies. What a joke/laighing stock. Hes doing it again just like 2020 same playgame, only he has mike Johnson on the inside to steal/cheat."

5EBGhSqj8k0,You can’t just report the news you have to put in your dig. Just report the news we are smart enough to figure out truth from fake news.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"The President referred to supporters of Trump as ""garbage."" And the media is still trying to do damage control as if it didn't happen. I think we're about to see a huge Trump win, and I think it might be time to reconsider how media is treated in America. You've voided your right to be taken seriously."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump 2024!
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Lol @ the constant pandering. First, it's a McDonald's. Now, it's a dump truck with his campaign slogan on the side of it? Who tf is falling for this self-proclaimed billionaire being a man of the working class? It's such blatant gaslighting. 😂😂😂"
5EBGhSqj8k0,Title is clazy
5EBGhSqj8k0,We are not a nation in decline.  Garbage in garbage out.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Have you taken notes with Trump? He not giving anything to the American people. He says he’ll cut taxes but on the other side of the coin he’s going to tax imports remember the United States doesn’t  manufacture much and we have to use these products so it’s gonna cost us consumers. He wants to put tariffs on foreign companies which we will fit the bill. He wants to take away federal spending which are Social Security, Medicare and so on. he wants to give no tax for tips.  Server try to push high tips like $30 and up. With Trump what do the American people get.
Trump and Elon have said in their conversation American people will have to suffer some hardship in order to prosper. What does that mean???"

5EBGhSqj8k0,“We have to protect our geniuses there’s not too many of them”🤣🤣
5EBGhSqj8k0,Get it together people. President Biden was referring to the so called comedian who wasn't funny and his remarks about Puerto Rico being an island of garbage. And saying that guy is garbage. You like to twist that to saying he was referring to all of you and go off on your indignant rant.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump doesn't care

5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump just got exposed for saying he admires Adolf Hitler and wants his supporters to be just like Hitlers Generals by his own Chief of Staff John Kelly, who he still praises and talks very positively about. 

All of you STILL supporting him have lost your damn minds. As Anti-American as it gets.. how far will you go for this guy? You would find a way to defend him even if he committed mass murder. Disgraceful"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"I think that’s a Semi, not a trash truck."
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Every day Trump says the Democrats are communists who hate America and want to destroy America. That is not exactly honest, since they are capitalists just like him, and it is also not very unifying to say that half the country is communist and hates America. Trump supporters don't even notice how he insults half the American people, but they do notice if they get insulted. Too bad they never said to Trump that it is wrong to call capitalists communists because they want people to have affordable health care.

We have public schools, universities, beaches, parks, libraries, hospitals, etc. We don't want to privatize everything in America and have tolls on every bridge and road built by private companies. These publicly owned things could be considered socialism if you want, but they benefit society. Even our farmers accepted government money  from Trump. No one called Trump a communist for giving away money to farmers."

5EBGhSqj8k0,Hillary called us DEPLORABLE.  Harris calls us NAZI's & Blames HER past 4 yrs on Trump.  Biden calls us GARBAGE.  President Trump calls us PATRIOTS.     Democrats only care about themselves & making themselves more money - they do NOT care about their country or it's citizens.   They care about getting richer & staying rich at Any cost to it's citizens.
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump is the ultimate troll slayer haha love it!

5EBGhSqj8k0,"OMFG! This clown, can't believe he is a major presidential candidate in the United States. It's painfully hilarious what's going on in here. The zoom in and out of the camera make it seem like those mock-umentaries like Parcs and Recs, only not that funny. This strategy right here, we can tell that joke about Puerto Ricans was on purpose to put him back on the spotlight once again -creating chaos the only way he knows how."
5EBGhSqj8k0,The garbage truck is hauling away the  Garbage.
5EBGhSqj8k0,"He's so pathetic.

5EBGhSqj8k0,"My god, he really can't say anything, without him adding ""ive done more for whatever than any president"".  No jackass, you hurled paper towels at them like you were giving away free t-shirts, which ironically would've been better.  He STILL thinks that all those people were there to see HIM.  Not for disaster relief, him, because he's just so loved?  Seriously, does ANYBODY still buy that crap?"

5EBGhSqj8k0,"And of course he did NOT withhold funding to Puerto Rico as this liberal reporter stated. The mayor was involved in stealing money that was given to them,  and she also abandoned the thousands and thousands of cases of bottled water instead of distributing it."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Trump 2024❤
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Ya right, you threw extra strength paper towels at them in Puerto Rico…..looser user!"
5EBGhSqj8k0,TRUMP 2024
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Trump is a comedic genius! Hahahaha.

These countries will turn to Russia and China and will It loses America's interests in the Middle East and the world, so the Democratic Party is dragging the world into a global war and a nuclear war, the entire world will be engulfed in its fire, and I hope everyone will take my voice and my opinion seriously and seriously. Attention is given to candidate Trump, a man of love, peace, security, economy, and stability in the world Your lover and the lover of America from the Middle East, you are our brothers and we will stand by your president. He concerns us all and concerns the entire world. Do not fall into the battle of the Democrats’ trap. Harris will not differ from Biden, so do not be deceived by words and slogans that are emptied of actions. She had the first word in the administration of bad Biden, the worst ruling president. America from his point of view Candidate Trump is the right man to rule America, to provide global stability, and to be a man of economics My regards to all of you ."

Even your editor for Youtube put it in the title, and you mistakenly showed the back of it during the end of the video, although you cut out the part where he gets into it, that shows the entire GARBAGE TRUCK."
5EBGhSqj8k0,Guess the Puerto Rican people aren’t voting for him ! The only place this clown is going is to jail !

5EBGhSqj8k0,He;s in the wrong end of the truck
5EBGhSqj8k0,"Putin's control over the Russian courts largely reflects the centralized power structure he has developed throughout his time in office. This structure, which seeks to keep the judiciary, legislative, and executive branches under his influence, operates through a mix of legal reforms, political appointments, and direct influence over key judicial figures. Putin has considerable influence over the appointment of judges, especially in higher courts. By appointing loyalists or those sympathetic to his administration, he ensures that the judiciary is less likely to challenge his agenda. Many judges owe their positions to him or his allies, and this loyalty affects their rulings. Constitutional amendments have increased presidential power, allowing Putin to shape the judiciary and make sweeping legal changes. For example, the 2020 amendments to the Russian constitution included provisions that extend his presidency and enhance executive power, which indirectly impacts judicial autonomy. In high-profile cases, especially those involving opposition leaders or critics, courts have issued rulings that align with the Kremlin’s interests. This indicates either direct influence or a judiciary attuned to the political consequences of its decisions.
Putin’s government has enacted laws that criminalize protests, free speech, and activities of NGOs, labeling them “foreign agents.” Courts enforce these laws rigorously, often targeting political opponents or civil society leaders. Unlike in many other countries, Russian judges face frequent dismissals or transfers. This precarious job security can discourage judges from challenging the government, as they risk their careers by making independent decisions.Through these mechanisms, Putin has maintained political order than on delivering unbiased justice.

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"""Kudos to CNN for hosting the pivotal debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which ultimately revealed the cracks in Biden's campaign and led to his withdrawal from the presidential race. The debate, held on June 27, 2024, was a game-changer, with many considering Biden's performance as the worst in televised presidential debate history ¹. The aftermath saw widespread calls for Biden to drop out, with notable Democrats like James Carville and Andrew Yang leading the charge ¹. Biden's exit paved the way for Kamala Harris to take the reins, and we saw a shift in the dynamics of the election. Credit goes to CNN for facilitating this critical moment in the 2024 presidential election."""

The Empty, Hocus-Pocus, Smoke and Mirrors campaign of Harris/Walz has Collapsed due to its Vague, Confusing, Gaslighting, Flip-Flopping, Misleading and Out-of-Touch political messaging to American Voters.

Harris Obviously DOES NOT have a positive agenda for the Country. She supposedly wants to fix the Major  problems in America that SHE HAD CREATED in the first place. Figure that one out Leftists!!!

We the Millions upon Millions upon Millions of Intelligent American Citizens across the Country and throughout the World can Clearly See right through the Fakeness of the Most Radical Communist/Socialist/Marxist Liberal Democrat politician ever to seek the Presidency. She WILL BE Rejected by the People today.

Right now as we speak, President Trump is ahead in the Honest Polls as he continues on a Trajectory toward his Massive Landslide Blowout Re-election Victory to the Tremendous Joy, Delight, Happiness and Major Relief of the America Public.  😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊"

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"No way back, PA Pennsylvania is worth 19 points of the cake, it is a fight to death, no way, GOPs will not hand it over Kamala Harris, no way"
Q7W2ei6n6-o,"Let me tell you a story that might shake you to your core. For years, I navigated some of the darkest corners of human struggle—childhood trauma, a battle with addiction, and a grueling journey through self-reinvention. Born in the Netherlands, I left for a subtropical island at 22, spending nearly two decades there before my path took me across the globe, from Abu Dhabi to China, from Germany to the United States. The fight to survive became a marathon of transformation that demanded I destroy and rebuild every single part of my life, a process that left me with nothing but my determination and vision.

Through those years, I studied the mind deeply—hundreds of books, unorthodox programs, and transformative practices that most people would shy away from. In the end, I emerged with something like enlightenment, not only surviving but mastering the art of influence and transformation.

I soon saw how this expertise could apply to the wider world. I wrote a groundbreaking script, a blueprint for harnessing every channel of media—both online and offline—to create influence like no one had ever seen. When a powerful media magnate saw the potential in my vision, I was asked to lead a project that would empower over 150,000 church leaders to mobilize their congregations and help re-elect Barack Obama. I was bankrolled by billionaires and pulled into a whirlwind of political power. And here’s what I learned: the entire system is a game—a sometimes dark, often corrupt, highly manipulative game.

💥Which brings me to this election. As an insider, I see a side of Donald Trump that is invisible to most. Behind the bluster, I recognize a familiar illness—a dangerous, hidden instability that mirrors the traits of a chronic addict who has never acknowledged or treated his underlying trauma. Trump suffers from a pervasive, untreated disorder that manifests through 160 distinct symptoms that could destabilize not only his personal life but the very fabric of a nation. Most people can’t see it, hidden as it is behind a complex web of facades and defense mechanisms, yet it’s the kind of sickness that destroys everything in its path.

The choice in this election may seem bleak, but for anyone who truly understands the danger Trump’s mindset poses, Kamala Harris is undeniably the safer option. It’s like choosing between a frying pan and a fire—but only one might burn you beyond recognition.

👌I speak as someone who has lived through the fire, who has learned to spot the signs of untreated pathology and addiction. And I promise you, Trump’s symptoms are as unmistakable as they are terrifying. This election isn’t about policy or ideology; it’s about preventing a time bomb from detonating at the heart of a nation.

It’s Gloves Off, America ❤🙏"

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"with trump no taxes on overtime means I will be making $16,000 more per year I can buy a new pickup because of Trump's new policies .
 Trump pledged  interest on a new vehicle's purchase tax deductible. which means I can save an extra $1800 per year.
 if Trump is able to reduce gas cost by 50% this means I would be saving an extra $1300 per year that's a total of $19,100 per year tax free.
~Company savings~
moreover it cost $420 to fill up a tractor trailer 100 gallons tank .if Trump manages to reduce the cost of gas by 50% we will be saving an extra $52,000 per tractor per yr.
That's a saving of $624,000 for one shift consisting of 12  company drivers.
We have two shifts.
We have about 12  city drivers they use roughly ½ tank fuel that's a total of $208,000. Per year
That's a total estimate of $832000 per year. 
Per terminal 
Product will get cheap.
Company will hire more.
More trucks will be purchased."

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"Guys, DO NOT VOTE solely for what is in your own selfish, perhaps even borderline xenophobic interest...😮

👊🏾👉🏾💎👈🏾👊🏾

That's exactly what RICH Slave owning Rebels and their POOR supporters of the Civil War TRIED TO DO to US....😮

Had it not been for Frederick Douglass browbeating President Lincoln into allowing freed Blacks and Slaves into the fight at the very last hour, at a critical time when most younger, White men opposed President Lincoln, and they even burn down New York City, rather than be drafted...😮

All because freeing Slaves WAS NOT in the best interest of them maintaining total control of ALL of the best paying jobs from Black Slaves...😮

Had he not listened to Frederick Douglass, and he instead kept  listening to his Generals, surely those Rebels would have indeed WON the Civil War...😮

Had the Rebels WON and the Country gotten divided, just THINK about where ALL of OUR asses would be TODAY...😮

Rememer, President Obama WARNED Trump about that Wuhan Coronaviruses in the last days before he took Office...😮

How did Trump respond?

Once he got into Office, his dumbass chose to pull ALL of the US scientists who were watching it, OUT of China right before it started spreading Worldwide...😮

As a Nation, WE can't afford to take another chance on such blatant IGNORANCE and STUPIDITY in the Whitehouse ever again...🎤💣💥💨🤷🏾‍♂️💯"

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"I live in PA; here is the raw data and strictly math facts. If you subtract the number of Republican early votes from the sum of non-republican early votes; that leaves a 641,582 republican deficit before Election Day votes. If we do not count the fact that some of those Republican ballots will go to Harris he would need to be leading by more than 500k votes before we start counting mail-in ballots. In 2020 he was only leading by 150k+ ballots before he lost by 83k. He is in a bigger early voting deficit now than he was in 2020. I am predicting that he is not going to be leading by more that 500k before we count mail-in ballots which means PA will not be the reason Trump is the 47th President."

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"This is it we may go anny momment now, God sent this news. Jesus Christ are lord and savior and son of god is returning at any hour now to take us home. he will come in shout of the archangel saying your name and to come up here, with the trumpet blowing all across earth that can make a world wide earthquake. dead and alive will change to body like christ an rise to meet to lord to heaven, an being rapture ready simple an easy. 1. believe that Jesus died on the cross and spilled his own blood for your sins (past, present, and future), was buried and rose on the third day from the dead in glory, heart and soul an meaning. 2. admit your a sinner and your need him to save you. 3. you pray to him on part 1 and 2 an repent your sins on him and his blood and in faith and trust and believe in him to save you. also try in these last days to walk like christ, if you messed up or sin, don panic for your sins are payed by his blood. past, present, and future sins. his morals and ways are greater then are own and i asks you seek not sinning as possible to show god you care about him. his blood cleans you and forgives you of sins. Because as Scripture say. ""throw faith and grace you are save not by your own works yet anyone can boast"". if reading this part you been left behind to face gods wraith and face the mark of the beast. were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead. it will be the only way to buy and sell anything. taking this mark is a unforgivable sin and forever dam to the second death. So if you stay behind don’t take the mark stay in faith to Jesus and resist cause they will chop your head off, let it happen if captured. For this time will be hell on earth. Lucifer/antichrist will force you to take it. Do not accept it choose death. i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word. Jesus loves us and nothing can separate us from him and faith and grace gets us saved. salvation and eternal life is a free gift from god nothing we earned or gained. Please it is important to spread this message to many. Jesus is your only way to avoid it. the signs are showing, more disasters and wars and suffering has increase dramatically. i pray to all see the true and believe.this is serious we may go any day now. ask an he will help you. An keep your bibles safe they will guide you in grand tribulation and Lucifer will try to destroy them. once we leave there be ww3, attacks on Israel and must of major powers destroyed. For there be 21 wraiths on this earth 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowels. that will make earth be hell on earth and most of the population would be dead so preparers you will not survived nor win against Lucifer. also there be two witnesses who will preach the news for the first half of the tribulation, kill by Lucifer and resurrected on the third day and rise back to heaven. there be disasters and plagues like rivers an oceans to blood, water turning bitter/poisonous and leads to some to death by wormwood astroid, scorpion with human like face and crowns will give those who have not accepted christ agonizing pain an people wont die when this plague happen for five months. scorch earth on the sun burns up earth, earthquakes tsunamis, will come on the earth and you be a hellish time to those left behind. an people who take the mark with have the worst punishing in the tribulation. At the end of the 7 year tribulation jesus turns to earth with is saints not during the tribultaion. Jesus on his white horse wearing a white robes with garment in red saying lord of lords, king of kings and his saints (us christian who died and raptured) will charge and defeat Lucifer, his followers and unbelievers and he will be cast back to the pit and Jesus will rule us for 1000 year. then Lucifer will try again and god will stop him for good and he and his follower and people who are not in the lambs book will be cast into lake of fire/second death. then the new Jerusalem, earth, and heaven will come and god will dwell in us forever with no sin, pain, evil, suffer are all gone. if you get behund do not faer, cry or be dismay. you can still be save just have to martyer for christ. you die but it be quick an temproaly pain. the wars with russia, china, iran, iserial, ulkraine, and taiwan are all time high and about to break out world war 3 soon. spread the word far and wide. were at the end of the world"

Q7W2ei6n6-o,"Key Controversies Surrounding Donald Trump
1. Racist Statements and Controversial Actions:

Mexican Immigrants: In 2015, Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists and criminals,” sparking widespread condemnation as a racist statement.
Charlottesville Protests (2017): Following violent right-wing protests in Charlottesville, Trump’s remark that there were “very fine people on both sides” was seen as a disturbing defense of extremists.
Travel Ban on Muslim-Majority Countries: Trump’s 2017 travel ban on primarily Muslim-majority nations was criticized as discriminatory and faced legal challenges.
2. Sexist Comments and Behavior:

Access Hollywood Tape: In a leaked 2016 recording, Trump boasted about inappropriately approaching women, which led to global backlash against his sexist behavior.
Comments on Female Politicians and Journalists: Trump has made derogatory remarks about women in politics, like Hillary Clinton, and journalists, including Megyn Kelly.
Allegations of Sexual Misconduct: Multiple women have accused Trump of unwanted advances and misconduct, leading to public and legal disputes.
3. Threats and Remarks on National Security:

Capitol Attack (January 6, 2021): Trump was accused of inciting violence at the Capitol after encouraging the crowd with statements seen as supportive of the attack.
Deployment Threats against Protesters: Trump repeatedly threatened to deploy federal forces against Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020, which was seen as authoritarian.
4. Entertainment Industry and Public Incidents:

Behavior on The Apprentice: Trump faced accusations of sexist behavior and misconduct during his time as host of The Apprentice.
Remarks about Puerto Rico (2024): A Trump rally in October 2024 featured a comment by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico “a floating island of trash.” Although Trump’s campaign distanced itself from the remark, it evoked memories of his slow response to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.
5. Support for Authoritarian Leaders and Stance on Ukraine:

Admiration for Vladimir Putin: Trump frequently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and downplayed evidence of Russian interference in U.S. elections, raising questions about his commitment to American interests.
Ukraine Conflict: Trump’s stance on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, including calling Putin’s actions “genius,” led to outrage, as he suggested that the U.S. stay out of the conflict.
6. Impact on Puerto Rican and Eastern European American Communities:

Puerto Rican Voters: Trump's comments and response to Hurricane Maria have alienated many Puerto Rican Americans, especially in swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania.
Eastern European Voters: His support for Putin and stance on Ukraine have caused concern among Ukrainian and Eastern European American voters worried about their countries’ safety."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Wonderfully presented piece. I really enjoyed it. Nevertheless, as an educated, critical thinker, i’m compelled to check sources ITMT. Corporate capitalism, human selfishness, greed, hyper-consumerism, laziness, ignorance, American exceptionalism, and bad old bigotry are destroying our ability to survive on this planet. That’s the elephant in the room that neither parties’ platform continues to fail to address. climate change and biosphere compromise. Ultimately, my determination is that we’re a petty, short-sighted species. Nowhere near enlightened as we’ve lead ourselves to believe."

I’m sure you know now is our last chance to act and is the perfect time. We can’t allow things to go back to normal and let our world burn. We have less than 5 years before the point of no return.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Frankly, I honestly doubt Trump will ever actually be allowed to enact *half* the shit he's been rambling about on stage, even WITH the majority of power concentrated in Republican hands.

Like, the moment his primary voter base of American nationalists realize why Trump is the only candidate running in 2028, they will eat him alive.

Say what you will about Trump supporters, and I'd probably agree, but the one thing they can all be of one mind on is the fact that the American Dream includes fighting against tyranny from without and/or within. Preferably with extremely violent prejudice.

Especially if he so much as *touches* the Constitution and the Bill of Rights."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,The US left and intelligentsia are the better educated Nazis. The only difference to the far right.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"As a non-American, I don't understand what the heck the Americans are thinking, whether it's Trump or Harris, you aren't winning, period. The ones winning are the rich, corporations and Israel no matter who is president. The middle class will continue to vanish and things are not going to get better. Once the downward spiral starts, there is no stopping it. Karma is right around the corner :)"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Thank you
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Did you mention Francis Schaeffer Christian writer and theologian in the 70s and 80s? No, why not. You’re younger than me Francis Schaeffer wrote a manifesto for essentially the violent take over by the church of the country if they couldn’t influence the nation to become essentially who Roman Catholic medieval Europe was. Find Frank Schaeffer his son who is no longer part of that world, but he was there and he knows the world of right wing Christianity of the seventies and 80s."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,yall really think the dems aren't backed by similar people? Just look at the people the Clintons etc. had ties with. I don't say that Trump is better but yall really think only the Republicans are playing that game? Kamala sais she wants to save abortion. Oh really? Tell me how she gon overrule a Supreme Court Decision (that abortion is a state affair )without fundamentaly changing the Constitution of America? Trump also used very questionable means to achieve this win. But why were immigrants allowed to vote eventough they just arrived? They don't know about the struggles of the country when they just arrived there tf? the two party system is f---ed. the only way to save you american people is to overthrow the two party system by starting to vote third parties like the rest of the democratic world. Your not stupid because you votedfor trump or kamala. your stupid because yall getting fooled by the same two machineries every 4 years. and then yall critizise people for voting jill stein tf if you really hate trump that much why dont You young people start to change the system within the boundries of the next election. Just like in Europe with some parties in the past years....

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"""Anti capitalist""= i hate my life because im not qualified to make more money 😂

Idk what fantasy economic system you all have in your head but truth is some people deserve more than others. All men are created equal but we dont stay equal. Capatilism is what leads people to be great and the people who hate it are just upset they got left behind"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Just remember the same people who are saying Trump will ruin the country are the same ones who said Kamala was winning by a landslide. These people are never right so lets pray they dont start saying Trump will be a great president 😂
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Doesn't want to talk about it- meanwhile he's taking every chance to distance himself from it...

8eeCPRD0Hgg,the irony that this 'channel' relies on a platform built on perpetuating the very systems it decries always pulls me out of the narrative somewhat. good points at times but still 6/10. a little too dystopian for me when i see the 'algorithm' show me this channel as something i would like (and therefore something youtube/alphabet can get money from my attention for). i miss old pbs.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Dude, what do you think you were doing here?? You keep complaining about the Democrats being the ""lesser evil"", but when it comes to the presidential elections, you suddenly start telling us how dangerous the Republicans are?
You are part of the reason why the Democrats lost 15 million votes compared to 2020 and why Donald Trump will be the next - and maybe last - president of the United States. Thanks for nothing."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The ""Heritage Foundation""  is the Authoritarian Parasitic Capitalist Fascist POS Few Low-Life, Vile, Vulgar, Immoral, Inhumane Evil Koch Brothers and ""their"" Evil ""Kochtopus"". I dedicated Years and Thousands of hours of my own time doing research and Deep Research on these (i.e. Koch Brothers) Authoritarian Parasitic Capitalist Fascist POS Few Evil MF'ers.

""Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are, in principle, under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist, that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level. [...] Just as I'm opposed to political fascism, I am opposed to economic fascism. I think that until the major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities, it's pointless to talk about democracy."" - Noam Chomsky 

""Capitalism’s concept of competitive man who seeks only to maximize wealth and power, who subjects himself to market relationships, to exploitation and external authority, is anti-human and intolerable in the deepest sense"" - Noam Chomsky 

“Man and fascism cannot co-exist. If fascism conquers, man will cease to exist and there will remain only man-like creatures that have undergone an internal transformation. But if man, man who is endowed with reason and kindness, should conquer, then Fascism must perish, and those who have submitted to it will once again become people.” ― Vasily Grossman (Life and Fate) 

“You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her whole soul.” - Mahatma Gandhi 

""Historically, the most terrible things - war, genocide, and slavery - have resulted not from disobedience, but from obedience."" - Howard Zinn

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"great job. Hope you are happy with the election results. You and other gen Z wannabe intellectuals made fascism possible in america again.

I warned you a year ago this would happen.

I genuinely hope you are happy."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"As a bisexual female American, Project 2025 is a threat to my rights and others like me. Unfortunately, I am now watching America fall apart.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Lies
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Fear mongering
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump is the perfect catfish for  elites. The poison we call food got an enemy recently. A group of consumers that wanted to demand proper food from the industry. They were instantly taken out by mainstream media by finding a Trump supporter in the group. Voila! Status quo stays untouched. Just like Trump's past cabinet. An exact replica of the Democrat cabinets.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Another fucking bullshit that will straighten up never happen
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Basically, turning the US into a capitalist China or Soviet Union. For the average folk on the street, it's identical."

Its the ownersof factories, and champaign drinking posho filth"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"How do you feel about leftists saying they're ""sitting this one out"", or voting 3rd party? Are you terrified that a loss for the Democrats this time around will push them further right, again? I want to hope for what we can do in the future, but I've always said you shouldn't criticize the government if you didn't vote to change it."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,whoa whoa whoa.... I like Trump but the party who thinks all of that is gonna happen is crazy. What do they think Trump would make it illegal to be Gay or Trans?? Every other percent of people will step up on taking such freedom of love and being away. Yes the Dems. are weaponizing them and making a mocker of them but do you think that the fault of anyone one of us? To have them wanting pawns to use as numbers? I think Trump will fix some problems and stop some unneeded wars cause by sleepy joe maybe we can afford food and gas and rent and everything little goddam thing that has gone up. That's why I'm voting Trump and I'm Pansexual and practice Pagan belief I hope that pisses off anyone who has a problem with that. ^^
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I do love this but one part he didn't cover.  Why is the heritage foundation so obsessed in being bigoted towards the marginalized?  Wouldn't companies profit off of being more diverse in their jobs and make them more money which is what conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation always seem to focus on.  Why this?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"YouTube keeps deleting my comment🤔 I love this video🫶
When is the left version of project scary 2025❓

I know I have to find leftists in my community then figure out how to plan actions that respects their extremely limited time due to daily work, home, and family responsibilities. 

I want to learn how to enable the isolated leftists in my rural community without making us a target of all the violent right wingers in my area.

I'm really hoping for a training series about how to organize local leftist coalitions to help united regular people against corporate billionaires stealing from the working-class people of our communities with their invisible hand tactics."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"11:49 So basically the groundwork for P2025, or the precursor of 2025?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Are you implying the Heritage Fund does *not* influence the Democrats too?   Surely they do.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Why are we just now hearing about this?
Who are the third party financial institutions?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Tax all churches NOW tax them higher than a legitimate business which provides legitimate products and services. Religion will die without their huge tax free profits and parsonages being exempt from taxation. Without religion, we will be free to think for ourselves."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Love your content. Long time subscriber. Keep up the informative videos. 

More Americans need to wake up and realize their country isn’t, and has never been the “free democracy” it touts itself to be. 

Bc, when it comes to capitalism, we don’t actually have a choice, or do we ?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Frightening how the Heritage Foundation can influence Presidents, government and the US to this extent.."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,They have been working to dumb down the country through things like No Child Left Behind so the populace won’t want to attempt even starting to read Project 2025.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Democrats are as equally hawkish as the democrats when it comes to plundering the lives of the taxpayers.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"""non partistan"" means the Rinos agree with the communists, what a scam."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This guy is full of it. pretty scummy.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Mean TV sounds strangely like a little mini capitalism. Hopefully it doesn’t get overrun with psychopaths like American capitalism.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,What do we do to fully stop them though. This is informative but what’s the solution??
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"😕🤔 this project 2025 , heritage foundation and christian  nationalism is NoT about the Christian Faith ; it's about power and elitist white men's politics and civil and religious control over resources and people's lives , from so called christians who have also gone so far off the track from fundamental Christianity , that calling it religious zealotry and religious confusion and religious fanaticism and religious extremism is far too lenient terminology ; as it will ultimately lead to many forms of civil and religious intolerence and persecutions ; this is The Stuff of Dark Ages BADness , working in real time full disclosure and revelation ,  and could very quickly become far more worse than it was back then❗‼️😳

⚠️⚠️  Trump Presidency WILL TRIGGER INSTITUTIONALIZED CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM ❗‼️
   ..WHICH IS NOT BIBLICAL ‼️⚠️ ; IT IS MAN MADE TRADITIONS OF THE MOST FANATICAL RELIGIOUS ZEALOTRY , IN THE MOST DARK AGES EUROPEAN SENSE OF ""POPE AND KING"" AKA A CRUEL ""UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF CHURCH AND STATE"" ; DIRECETED AT CONTROLLING THE MINDS AND CONSCIENCES OF THE PEOPLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN FREE WILL DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR PERSONS , THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR ACTS OF WORSHIP UNDER GOD❗‼️🤨
    ..READ THE USA CONSTITUTION AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT 🇺🇸  ..AND KNOW FOR SURE WHERE OUR PILGRIM FORE-FATHERS HAD COME FROM IN THEIR THINKING , FAR AWAY FROM RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE AND PERSECUTIONS‼️

✅ True , Christian Nationalism is a SNARE upon the USA and it's Constitution ; and will become a geo- religio-political Snare upon the world❗only to offer draconian firman decretals upon All people‼️🤔

   All of This was Prophesied , and will come to pass upon the USA and upon the world stage , If it is allowed to , by the People ‼️🤨

modern day passages from a true modern day Prophet of God....
Ellen Gould White, 1917, Prophets and Kings, 277. ChS 52.1 - ChS 52.3

I highly recommend reading ""THE GREAT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN""
ELLEN G.WHITE  1888  REV. 1911
[modern day authentic seer/prophet of God]

Chapter 36 - The Impending Conflict
""Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and under the influence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience."" GC 588.1

As the Protestant churches reject the clear, Scriptural arguments in defense of God’s law, they will long to silence those whose faith they cannot overthrow by the Bible. Though they blind their own eyes to the fact, they are now adopting a course which will lead to the persecution of those who conscientiously refuse to do what the rest of the Christian world are doing, and acknowledge the claims of the papal sabbath. GC 592.2

The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, persuade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of divine authority will be supplied by oppressive enactments. Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for truth; and even in free America, rulers and legislators, in order to secure public favor, will yield to the popular demand for a law enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which has cost so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected. In the soon-coming conflict we shall see exemplified the prophet’s words: “The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” Revelation 12:17. GC 592.3"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"They are both on the same team. Sure, they have certain appeals that allow the division of the country. But that doesn’t matter. When one team (D) stands for the most insane policies, the only reasonable option is to vote (R)."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Congratulations, Trump does not agree with project 2025. You actually agree with the orange man with at least one thing now."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Thanks for this, JT! I'll definitely subscribe to the service also. Anything to support you guys and the service. ✊🏼🙏🏼

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"America is doomed, this country will fall to the hubris of the Institutional Fascists and Capitalists who support Project 2025. They will fall as well because sooner or later the rest of the world will stop investing in the dollar and will invest in the yuan, and China will be the future winner in this long game they play until their empire eventually falls as well. This is how empires fall, from within by greed and a lust for power."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"We shouldn't remove people that came here under joe.

The new Democrat is even thinking of building the wall. Thats not ok! We need to pay immigrants and take healthcare slots from veterans.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,FBI agents came to my house today 😂
8eeCPRD0Hgg,They gaslight Americans by using George Soros as the billionaire bogeyman for Dems! Leonard Leo has quietly been the real leader of the DJT agenda for years. The Heritage foundation members have infiltrated all aspects of the judicial system so any legal issues can be resolved through their world view.. not the law. If anything is meant to be the Deep State control it is them. But keep bringing this cabal if religious zealots to light.. which is what they hate
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"CNN? The same ones who said Hunter Biden laptop was Russian propaganda?

EDIT: I want to edit this. I’m highly skeptical of these accusations because we heard so many for the past 8 years and a lot of them turned out to be lies. However I could see easily how this can get out of control. Even if Trump isn’t the guy to be the fascist dictator we eventually will have one take power if the president and other bureaucrats aren’t kept in check.

The reality is people are sick of the lies and being pimped out by congress. Trump represents a different breed of politician that people feel like they can align with. The truth is we need Congresional Term limits and in my opionion 4 presidents. Two who handle foreign policy and two domestic policy. With one from each being the tie breaker for either side.

We as Americans need to limit government control and keep our freedoms and liberties that’s it. No matter what party you’re with!"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Morons think that Project 2025 is real lmao
8eeCPRD0Hgg,It's all shady. None of us peasants will see what the inner circle looks like.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I am NOT a Trump supporter but I will never be convinced that Harris is a better option. Look at what Biden has done to this economy by printing 80% of all the US dollars that have ever existed in the course of 4 years. That man deserves to be in prison at bare minimum for treason.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Moral: Organized and functional societies don't lasts long.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Capitalism has been the ""evil empire"" all along with the shiny new things that people got bought into"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The Democrats have their own version of Project 2025 in effect.  It includes:
-Mass illegal immigration and soft on crime policy to destabalize US society
-Generational minority poverty
-Psychological manipulation and physical mutilation of kids who may just be going through a phase
-Authoritarianism.  The majority of acceptance of the pandemic response showed Democrats how far they can go and no doubt will embolden them to go further in the future
-The systemic racism of victimhood mentality and lowered expectations
-The gradual transfer of authority over children from the family to the state
-Identity politics for the purpose of distorting an individual's true sense of self
-Keeping racism alive for political expediency
-Gradual erosion of the US education system, ie math is racist
-Erosion of achievement by merit
-Vulgar racism towards any non-white person who doesn't vote Democrat"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,#project2025Tyranny aka #fascism: just like Hitler - a narrative of #nationalGrievance and a powerless group - migrants to SCAPEGOAT for it all. Once the dictator gets the POWER he always turns it on his own people. #SupremeCrooks already gave American KINGS aka presidents immunity for Hitler-Trump and starting with him. His 3 loyal supreme crooks he appointed hard at work destroying FREEDOM and democracy in USA.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"non-sense, tanky"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Great video, thanks JT!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,America transitioned into the fascism country so gradually I didn't even realize.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,So everyone just forgets project 2030. The democrats equivalent to project 2025 where they were gonna get rid of private land and build and overpopulate major cities. Housing would be given by the government and everyone would grow vegetables on their roofs. The rich would give monthly tax through the government and pass it to ordinary Americans. Republicans caused outrage over it years ago. This stuff is all bullcrap propaganda to keep y’all in fear.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,So when it comes down to it...profit.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Just realized looking at your other videos that the average american isnt your target audience and are as sellouts as rage against the machine lmfao
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This video is a good reason to vote Oliver tbh
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Why 900 pages? Bet you there’s some incoherent nonsense in it
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Apparently I have to qualify this by saying I'm Black and queer, but if you allow the Dems to continously trick you into voting for them and don't do any anti-capitalist community work, all you're doing is supporting empire. We'll lesser of two evils ourselves into fascist or climate apocalypse. Personally, I'm done supporting anymore imperialist candidates."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"AVANTE CAMARADAS! ABRAÇOS DO BRASIL!

8eeCPRD0Hgg,What fucking heartless and soulless scumbags.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Not sure I entirely follow your politics but this was an excellent investigation. Quite refreshing to get an in-depth look at the Heritage Foundation as opposed to some other ""investigations"" where they downplay the foundation's influence and connections to Trump or even the mainstream media investigations which lack concrete details. Well done!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I feel stuck. This looks horrible, but will K amala be any better, or even worse???"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,I know who they are! They suck! :D
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The Heritage Foundation has done an eye-watering amount of damage to the working and even middle class.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"You know, I've been watching lots of 'leftist' videos about Project 2025 over the last year or so, and have blindly accepted as truth everything they told me. But all I needed to do was read 'A Guide to Project 2025' on the fcat cechk cite o nline to see that what I've be led to believe about P-2025 is actually not true at all."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Looks like there's some sneaky edits in the clips of trump talking about P-2025. I'm pointing this out because my trump-loving wife sees that and says you guys edited to make it look like he's saying something he didn't, and I'm left standing there with my bare face hanging out.  Just because trump says the name 'Heritage Foundation', my wife says, doesn't mean he knows what's in the P-2025 document, and anyway, there's no way in hell he's going to implement any of it."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Scab beer
8eeCPRD0Hgg,If we follow Kamala Harris we're going down a rabbit hole right now and if the past is an example of the future I think that says enough about way she wants to run things look around you people see what's going on she has the opportunity right now to change things and she isn't so she won't actions to find people not words I'm an independent I think I know who I'm voting for
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Why does no one seem to point out that both Trump and the Republican party have a published platform that details what they will do when in office. All candidates running for any office in the US have one. reading both shows to me the only real difference is tax cuts vs extra ""rich"" taxes, gun control, and abortion. everything else was pretty milk toast for both candidates."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I don't notified of your uploads anymore. This algorithmic suppression is really pissing me off

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Commenting for the algorithm
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Unrelated topic, what is your opinion on Furries?

It's a community that gets a bad light, but I wanted to know how my fellow socialists view them."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"This is exactly why there needs to be a ton more focus on education and civic involvement. When people have the information, they much more often make better choices with voting, etc. With so much misinformation and disinformation out there, it makes it so much harder to combat the uninformed opinions and the apathy."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"For my MAGA brothers and sisters:
How do you not feel betrayed and lied to?  That’s how I feel.
I voted for Trump when he said he would lock Hillary up, … he didn’t.  Also, that he would clean up the swamp, … he didn’t, and doesn’t say that anymore, did you notice.
In fact, we all wanted to clean up the deep state, he doesn’t say he wants to clean up the swamp anymore because he is now backed by the deep state.  The Heritage Foundation who wrote Project 2025 with JD Vance, IS THE DEEP STATE.    Can you not see that you have been lied to.  First by Trump and Bannon calling all professional news, fake news.  Granted, every news outlet has a spin to stories, but by undermining your confidence in professional journalists, you naturally seek the “truth” elsewhere, and that leads you right into misinformation of unprofessional sources, who are backed by the deep state, and foreign entities including Russia and China.  
Use you God given brain and common sense to question these sources.
I mean, if you step back and evaluate these stories, they sound crazy:
 lizard people running the government 
Joe Biden is dead, and it’s an actor playing him, but Trump is still president, but all the problems in America are not because of him but the actor, Joe Biden.  Do you see the logic problem?
Trump is chosen by god to lead the country.  Trump is factually as cheater, liar, adulterer, thief, not paying multiple people who have done work for him, and taking advantage of people that admire him by selling them: golden sneakers, watches, trading cards, crypto, ….etc. Trump is one of the least Christian politician in a long time.
The inside source “Q” told us Trump was still president and would arrest the deep state in December 2020, then January 2021, then February ‘21, then June ‘21 for sure…. it never happened,  Aren’t you MAD that you have been LIED to and mislead.  There are credible sources that say Steve Bannon is “Q” 
Are you aware of PROJECTION? Saying your opponent is the thing you are, or is doing the thing you are doing:
The Democrats are trying to cheat and steal the election.  Have you been paying attention to all the legal tricks the republicans are doing across the country to steal the election?
Gerrymandering 
Challenging and eliminating registered voters
Installing election officials that will only certify a Trump win, no matter the vote.
Trying to have a hand count of millions of votes in Georgia, which would introduce chaos, confusion and questions about the election.
Projection of Kamala as a liar, where Trump has told more lies than any president in history 
Projection of Comrade Kamala,  comrade means friend in Russian, who is the bigger friend to Russia, when Trump praises Putin frequently, would not defend Ukraine, calls Putin on several occasions while he was campaigning, and gave Putin covid tests when they were in short supply in the U.S., …COMRADE TRUMP.
Projection of Kamala being radical, when Trump says he would use the military against American citizens who disagree with him.
Projection of Kamala being a fascist, pay attention! Project 2025 is a plan for fascism!  Removing everyone in the government not loyal to Trump.  Stacking the Supreme Court to give Trump immunity.  Saying he would use the military against American citizens who disagree with him.  Remember, Hitler was elected at first, then people couldn’t vote, and couldn’t disagree with him."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Working class people who think capitalism is amazing, despite the fact it's against their best interests and is actively making their lives worse, are basically licking CEO/billionaire/millionaire/shareholder  boot leather, before pulling their cacks down, bending over, spreading them, and screeching ""do me dry boss"""

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Vote either uncommitted or for a third party both parties are corrupt puppets at this point
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The electoral college will decide who's the best president for the good ol USA.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Remember all the violent crackdowns against protests that have happened under our democrat presedency and tell me with a straight face that harris will somehow be pushed left after she's elected, despite running on far right policies"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"😂😂 people trynna act like project 2025 doesnt exist is hilarious, the fact that he has to distant hisself from this but still has members of his crew that align with that methodology is spooky, the heritage foundation has has some very strange ideas that they are very open about, be aware"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So... even if Trump is secretly working with them, why didn't he take their plan in 2016 and he doesn't even have to inact the whole plan. Fear mongering!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Now Heritage just came out with Project Esther, with is a new plan to stamp out the Pro-Palestine movement….a week before Trump started talking about using the military on “the enemy within”."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Even if drumph doesn’t win the fascists will keep working towards their goals, and because the flaws in our system only allow capitalist establishment partie the democrats will aid and abet the fascist takeover. Which is already well begun."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"If people don't think big business will resort to fascism, they've done it before. Go look up the Business Plot. Basically J.P Morgan was going to revolt against the FDR administration. It didn't happen because Smedley Butler told them no and rolled on them. They've had a century to refine their bullshit since then."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Dumps Mein Kampf.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Thank you!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"oops, this is like my government after we found out there was a official government social media taskforce with the primary goal to influence public opinions"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Whenever given the chance... capitalists will always choose fascism to improve their bottom line... every... single... fuckin...time
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Knew you had that Coors out for a reason... the bastards

8eeCPRD0Hgg,9:04 - Reader's Digest?!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,TRUMP STARTYED PROJECT 2025 IN 20 19
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I still don't understand how Project 2025 is theoretically even legal but I can imagine the Heritage Foundation definitely doesn't want other people to know about it, because the more people know about it, the more people are going to be opposed to it and that'll make it more difficult for them to do anything with it"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So ah, vote for Kamala if you didn't catch that part."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Anybody who thinks that the same agenda won't be implemented by a Democratic administration needs to give their head a shake as the Dems have largely been doing it only with prettier words and people that appear more progressive and thus more appealing to some. 

There's no Democratic accountability with either party ... if there were then there would be a lot less money going to the Pentagon, stupid proxy wars in places no one has heard of or cares much about and funding Genocides by a maniacal, racist state that has a big spending lobby group in the U.S and there might even be a single payer health care system like what exists in every other developed country including Israel which is heavily funded by U.S. taxpayers.

The parties are just two big organized crime families that appeal to different segments of the electorate but pursue fundamentally the same objectives because they have the same big donors."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I did read it a bit and there was pretty authoritarian actions they wanted to implement...

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Hey JT! Completely off topic, but did you know that you bear a striking resemblance to Frankie Munez?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The Heritage Foundation also came up with the Affordable Care Act, it was the right wing alternative to Medicare for All but you'd never know it with how much Republicans have criticized Obamacare since then. Obama spent all his political capital passing their plan which passed without a single Republican vote, when he could have gotten universal healthcare coverage instead."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The road to fascism is paved right under our sleeping noses. We are being shackled to wage slavery chains while making the rich richer.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,If these think tanks are creating policy.. then why the hell do we need these politicians in office?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I can't stand around with regular the republicans, but everything that you're pointing out here is exactly what Clinton Obama and Biden have done as well. So I really don't see the ""threat"" here.

And what is The Heritage Foundation?  

A bureaucracy.  Just without ANY accountability to the Legislature."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,What a coincidence you posted this the day after I was researching the background of the Heritage foundation and who were funding it in startup.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Opus Dei is behind it

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Liberty will die with thunderous applause
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Thanks. Is there a single glint of light in this enveloping darkness? Genocide in Gaza, the almost certain, possibly imminent, collapse of the AMOC (Us whities fleeing south from the ice wall - who'd a thunk it. Hope the darker skinned people are kinder to us as refugees than we have ever been to them). Fascism in USAmerica. (To be honest, I'm not sure the rest of the world will notice much difference, but we do care about your poor, your downtrodden, your huddled asses.) It will be interesting to see a fascism whose enemy is simply the poor and defenceless - an equal opportunity system of hatred. ""We don't care about the colour of your skin, your religion (not really, see the inspirational story of Mohammed and Jared, a Jew and a Muslim, who set aside their differences to jointly hate on the powerless.) I don't want to be a refugee. We were supposed to get our climate act together after a few billion of 'them' died, they were like the canaries in our coal mine. 'We' were supposed to be ok, apart from the 'grief' of killing all the refugees trying to get in. Help?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I don't think there's enough emphasis on the the fact that everything they want to do is a bad idea 
Either we stop them from doing these things or they do these things and they produce terrible results and then they stop

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"A lot of people lose sight of how something like Project 2025 is part of a bigger phenomenon than just one election cycle; it can be easy when the media machines spin up, and you're bombarded with election ads and outreach nonstop.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,I didn't expect an authoritarian leftist to dive so deep into conservative shenanigans.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So heritage foundation dumbs down their “research” to dumb down the Republican politician to dumb down the Republican voter.

Yeah sounds about right. No wonder majority of Republican voters are uneducated. 

Another thing that pisses me off about all this, the most the people can do is vote to put someone in office, but after that, said person could easily be persuaded by bribes, uh I mean lobbing to then make policies against what they originally ran for. Impeach? Remove them from power? Yeah unless they are in a big enough scandal, they never suffer such things."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The march toward Neoliberalism and Conservative policies in Fortune 500 Corporations apparently started in the 1970's.  You should also cover the Powell Memo written to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 1971.  In this memo, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Project 2025 is the same trash that these goons have been pushing for since I can remember.

Trump is a goddamned liar. He knows exactly what these goons want and what he is going to do to get it. 

A silver lining in this mess is that Trump knows that he has to lie about his connection to Project 2025. This is a clear tell that they know that these ideas are replusive to most people."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"About 2 years ago I asked myself: ""when will US openly declare it's fascism?"". Well and this year I got my answer, as the talk about project 2025 became more widespread around the world.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"If right wing policies primarily benefit the top 1%, why does half the country vote for them?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"For context, right-wing cults and organizations have spent the past few decades paying for propaganda to portray lgbt people as a religious/political ideology.
The members of their cult and those who fall for their indoctrination genuinely believe that trans people don't exist... that gay people don't exist, that lesbians don't exist, that bisexual people don't exist, that intersex people don't exist, that asexual people don't exist... etc.

Despite extensive and conclusive evidence that all these people are real, and do in fact exist... and are simply a natural part of the broad spectrum of humanity.

It's a bit like the flat-earth cult convincing people that the earth isn't round, because it keeps them engaging with and giving money to the flat-earth cult.

In cult psychology, you do this to control the perception and exposure of those you wish to exploit.

For example, pretend you run one of those flat-earth clubs with membership fees and merchandise... you can't disprove all the concrete evidence that the earth is round, and if your cult members learn about our solar system they'll realize you're a fraud and stop giving you money.
So you don't show them the evidence and disprove it, you tell them that the evidence is made up so that you can claim you don't have to disprove it... the earth isn't 'round', that's just a made up ideology by big globe tech or a fake religion made up by the big globe illuminati.

Now if that cult members sees a working model of the solar system, they won't think - 'Oh cool what's that? How does our planet work?' like a normal person and learn about it... that cult member will see the solar system and subconsciously dismiss it and think 'Oh I know everything about that! That's a fake made up scam ideology!' ...and learn nothing about it.

Controlling a person's perception and experience in this manner keeps them ignorant and easy to manipulate... and keeps them coming back and buying your flat-earth cult T-shirts.

The same principles are used by bigoted political and religious cults against lgbt+ people to dehumanize and invalidate their existence.
Such organizations can't disprove the overwhelming substantive evidence for trans peoples' existence, nor do they wish to allow their members to learn anything about trans people.
Instead they falsely advertise and misrepresent it as 'trans ideology' and 'trans activism' or 'woke ideology' and 'gender ideology'... which just like the flat-earth cult, keeps their victims ignorant and easy to manipulate.

So now like you see here, they don't say 'Oh? What's a trans person?' nor learn anything about reality...
...they say 'I know everything about this! Why are you forcing this made up religious ideology on me!?'.

Because they are under the delusion that trans people aren't real, and that everyone merely 'believes' they're real... as if we're believing the tooth-fairy is real and activists are forcing them to put their teeth under our pillows for us.

Once you've convinced all these victims to believe in such a delusion, that the evil tooth fairy activists are coming for their teeth and their wife's teeth and their children's teeth... you can then tell them you're 'anti tooth-fairy', you're 'anti-fairy', you're against the 'woke teeth agender'...

...and you need good honest noble heroes to give you money and vote for you so that you can finally stop the evil globalist tooth-fairy 1984 apocalypse that's definitely happening right now!

This is why such hysteria exists around these subjects.
The same type of propaganda manipulation was used against women in the 1930's.
Then against working class people in the 1950's.
Then against black people in the 1960's-70's.
Then against gay people in the 1980's.
Then against atheists.
Then against muslims.
Then against bisexuals.
Then against young generations.
Then against migrants.
Etc. etc. etc...

They all have one thing in common: They flourish when they keep the masses divided, which is their typical MO. Modern times, with so many powerful and wealthy grass root and astroturfing groups undermining democracy and manipulating political systems through, guess what, keeping people divided, groups like Heritage Foundation express their utter disdain toward the working class. They are naturally evil because they are part of the bourgeois. They get richer, they get more powerful, and we're kept too ignorant of our surroundings while they operate in the shadows, because they know they are evil."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Great job. I have to think about how to share this on Facebook to.. Everyone.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Yep - it's such a quiet take-over. It's terrifying on every level.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So wtf would you recommend be done about this?  I don't get it, is this channel just about decrying the decline of democracy, whilst offering no analysis on how to tackle that decline, or pose any solutions to correct it? If so, then you're no better than Project 2025."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,You have a lot of courage to talk about these topics in the USA. I would be scared the government would put a (death) contract over my head.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,The first clip of Trump is all you need. Now move on. Next video.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"This is the first time I've seen someone say what I've been saying for years. That it doesn't really matter that much if Donald Trump wins, because someday a republican is going to win, and when they do, they are going to institute these policies. It's only a matter of time. It's more or less inevitable."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Why does it always date back to Reagan. Every. Single. Time.

And the worst part is that because it always goes back to Reagan, it sounds like you’re just a bias hater of Reagan when you blame him for stuff rather than the fact that he was actually the catalyst for so many issues. 😭 

(P.S, do you have a reference list for these videos? Like a list of sources and stuff? I have a pretty staunchly anti-socialist friend group and even though your content is entertaining and high quality, they will refute everything because there’s no explicit sources. Do you think in future you could put a Google doc with your sources in the description or something?)"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"ok i will ask but this is all dumb because if the donald trump gets elected he cant just make 2025 project the law
it has to go trhough congress and the house and they would never let it pass so its impossible for it to ever be made true"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Project 2025 is project 2024 is project 2011 is project 2001 is project 1980. Literally just more neoliberalism and conservatism. It's a big scare tactic.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Honest question: isn’t this whole video not an argument to vote for Harris?

(I’m voting for de la Cruz, btw)"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Get organized, dummies! Knowing is not enough."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Donald Trump, along with everyone who was part of The Heritage Foundation should all be categorized alongside Hitler, Mao Zedong, and Joseph Stalin as the most heinous and deplorable human beings in history!!!!!"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Even if theres a 2% chance of this actually happening, what would your honest reaction be if Trump gets elected, turns the country around, does not employ fascism, reduces the federal government, removes all corruption, gets money out of politics, and removes all bailouts and subsidies, solves inflation, and gets people into homes again, and then leaves politics in 2028?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Crazy to me how some people have enough money to last them a lifetime 100x over yet they still find a way to be greedy
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Solid video JT. Thank you for helping spread the word about how bad Heritage really is. If anyone wants a breakdown of what all is in Project 2025 in less than 30 minutes, I made a video about it:

https://youtu.be/NELdBvTK_eU"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I forgot 2025 is only two months away
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Imagine if leftist stopped wasting time on performative bullshit and actually organized. There’s ALWAYS some mini easily movable roadblock that paralyzes leftist movements. Combo that with leftist being appeased by fake change (like a new holiday or painting on the road.)and we’re in the state we are in today. Occupy walk street and blm were both great and theory but REALLY don’t interact with the systems at large to implement change.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Getting Trump to tell the truth (Project 2025) while staring into a camera, is like expecting Tony Soprano to admit he is a mobster."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I love your content but it makes my chest hurt 😰
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"im extremely surprised you didnt mention how heritage foundation members endorse Kamala harris. while 2025 is the boogeyman of democrats, that means to a lot of people that trump is the boogeyman. here we have kamala, a genocidal boarder cop as VP and running for president, pouring all this money into israel when in actuality, a lot of that money is just funneled right back into defense contractors and our own industries to send what they were already sending. im sure lockheed is elated with both kamala and heritage at the moment. endorsed by dick and liv cheney, 200 non-trump republicans endorsed her, and shes so extremely pro war and pro wall that youd think hillary was a leftist if kamala ran as democrat in 2016. 
this is a socialist channel that left its video hosting sites due to lacking context of the site wide statement around palestine. i have no idea how the democrats who become ever increasingly right wing werent mentioned in the context of what direction america is going in under bi-partisan support and how heritage might run p2025 under kamala instead."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I’m no socialist but this was a very thought out video that does well in explaining about the project, it’s saddening that such a thing exist and is ready to be released, but do take my sub"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Great video! Truth needs to come out!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Nine years ago, I came this close to marrying an American man and moving to Texas. Long story short, he did a complete 180 just weeks into us shacking up, so I flew back to South Africa and never looked back. Boy, did I dodge a giant bullet, eh?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I know money is useful (only cause we allow it to be) but why do people want so fucking much! It’s ridiculous what some of these companies will do to make more profit
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"For those who don't know,  Reagan is the original maga and the creator of reaganomics aka trickle down economics.  It didn't work then and it never has."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,bro i love ur channel but i cant watch this bc it makes me mad how much republicans need to see this😭😭🙏
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"You won me at 9:45,  I love it."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I already felt guilty about my doordash orders.  Did you really have to call me out like that?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,think tanks should be illegal
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"really great video man, as always. do you have a link for any further reading?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,And most people will go back to sleep afte this election cycle regardless of the outcome. These guys have nothing but time to make whacky plans like cartoon villains.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"♪ Ronald Reagan was a actor/not at all a factor/just an employee of the country's real masters ♪  -Killer Mike, ""Reagan""

Of course, in modern times Reagan would be kicked out of the GOP for being a RINO. Imagine today's reaction to Reagan's quotes such as ""America is the place people are supposed to escape to,"" or ""The border should be open both ways."""
8eeCPRD0Hgg,i really hope we can defeat fascism once and for all.  i hope one day that socialism becomes the way of every day life.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I left a comment earlier i didn't expect to get snapped at. Just wanted to say sorry and I love the channel. Viewers please be aware carter Obama Clinton and biden all passed major heritage policies. That's all I wanted included. Ty
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Is it linked to the atlas network?

8eeCPRD0Hgg,I was hoping for lo-fi soviet anthem here 17:45
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Heritage was all over the TV during the Bush years. It seemed at prestigious as something like the Atlantic.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The US is an End-Stage Corporatist Oligarchy.  I'm completely mentally divested from this gd'd Wasteland on all levels now.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,It’s also disheartening that Kamala said she would put a republican in her cabinet and was even willing to work with the heritage foundation.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Thank you
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Oof, I don't see much pragmatism to ""revolutionary optimism"" these days. I think we just survive and live whatever pleasures we can, while we can. The world is just gonna keep going downhill and nobody is going to fight against it hard enough that they can beat the brainwashing and the absurd military tech."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Can we check authors to corolate and see how many of them were the people he fired previously?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The Heritage Foundation. Who’s heritage are they referring to?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I visited the Heritage foundation in college with a Poli Sci program. I listened to an education “researcher” in their staff propose banning public schools and tying interest rates in student loans to degree type. Oh also basically whitewash uncomfortable parts of US history. It was the most bat shit insane stuff I heard and we were of course asked to be respectful and seriously consider it lmao.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I love how all the Trumptards are in total denial, or are completely ignorant to P25, and just launch into ad hominem attacks because they have no clue what’s going on and are once again out of the loop so they think its all a Democrat conspiracy."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"“This is project 25.” But is that a Coors? Product placement, really? I remember when I was a kid. In Mississippi, Coors was unavailable, and anyone having one was to be envied and approached for a “give-me.”"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Well this was waaaaay more scarier than expected. I don’t want to live in a fascist world at all. Gotta keep voting blue every 4 years, every 2 years, every year, just vote blue till they finally give up GTFO to hell !!!!!!"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,I understand that you are answering the question seriously... but I suspect at the end of the day it will still come down to religious cu*ts.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I was in a ""behavioral training recovery"" facility as a teen and I disagree with these wackos and their ideology. It's not a joke. They aggressively advertise to scared parents and then convince them to pay 50k or whatever for a religious based behavioral training program. No joke, Indiana. Mike Peance, GOP republicans, christian catholic, they want god to rule the earth so they can use it to scam period."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So what? Then vote green? Sorry, but the democrats are the only ones who can stop this for now."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I argue that is the failures of the democrats and liberalism that have led to the rise in fascism. As well as it’s their unwillingness to confront it materially because they still profit from those contradictions that lead to fascism. So voting democrats isn’t going to save us from fascism, it will either slow it down or speed it up"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Nothing good will ever come from the Heritage Foundation.  End of line.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,do the democrats have anything similar in terms of a plan?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,So you can take time out of your day to stop bashing democrats to talk about the real threat
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Brilliant video! Might I recommend the books ""The Family"" & ""C Street"" by Jeff Sharlet. Just in case you doubt the reach & power of Christian fascism in our government"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I think it would have been really useful and definitely necessary to link liberalism to the platform espoused by the Heritage Foundation and its supporters. Maybe a summation of the video you did several months ago about liberals. When you listen to the checklist that you briefly went over in this video, I immediately thought of how many Democratic candidates Institute of those very things"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,You should do a video on how they bought out the Supreme Court. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse wrote a book about it and does daily speeched to an empty chamber about the bought and sold supreme court.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Why does Trump even play the not knowing about 2025 card when heritage foundation members are very involved with him and his campaign, including his own vice president? So, regardless of the angle you want to look at it from, either he’s lying about not knowing and not being involved, or he doesn’t talk with his staff enough for them to tell him about their life’s work. Worse yet, if he did talk with his staff enough, it would imply that they just don’t trust him enough to tell him about what they want from him. No matter what, it makes Trump look bad; he’s really good at doing that."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"As an European, I wonder if our grandparents saw the exact same movie 100 years ago, with Italy and Germany slowly fading into nazi-fascism with the silence and the consent of the ignorants and the corrupted ones. That's scary, because we all know how it ended up."

Phase 2 I bought my car a mini van I transformed into an emergency home .
Phase 3 a non taxable income that's gets me my insulin and my income is $17,567 net a year to diabetic doctors pay on a curve. 
Project 2025 is the white version of jim crow for middle class whites the wealthy want to transform into the low wage working class roll back the clock to 1930s. Being black and only 12% of America's population since slavery we've always been in project 2025.
In 1980 I was 10 my dad worked gm plant's and I had dental & healthcare until he passed in 1995. From 1995 to 2018 I had no heath or dental insurance 23yrs no healthcare and been working minimum wage job's since 1987. The result a tumor and diabetes I had covid 3 time's from 2021-2024 9 surgerys and have survived so far even with insulin cost out of reach at $615 a month  now  $70 every 20 days. 
My poor peoples healthcare and dental was defunded by republicans in 2023 November so on a 6 times below poverty level American standard I've managed to survive. My project 2025 is to prepare for the next hit from the wealthy whatever it may be"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Born in 61 I have seen another but loving history has brought it further.  What is comes down to is when we ignore history we are doomed to repeat.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"This republican party ultimately wants full dictatorship through a military state of fear and oppression with voting rights gone. The battle between democracy and autocracy has been going on in the world for a long time. Ukraine is fighting it with their lives right now and Europe thanks them for it. (America should too) These type of republicans and maga are now joining the autocracy side and they are absolute traitors to freedom. Sure some of these rich people will become even richer oligarchs after they've been rewarded for their loyalty, but a very high price will be paid and turning back would be very hard. Sadly civil war would be the best outcome if this happens, but it might not even happen if people are too afraid, misinformed and divided like in Russia. If American democracy falls, autocracy will win. Europe won't stand a chance vs. America's, Russia's and China's combined autocracies. It's America who calls the shots. Keep voting blue and hope democrats stay somewhat not corrupt."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,the SpongeBob clip 🥲 thanks for your work!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"ah Weyrich, the 'goo-goo' guy. Now I remember"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Im too tied to care tbh. Fuck all this. All i need NOW is a new higher paying job with less stress so i can pay my fucking bills. 

That above is literally what is stopping millions to understand, let alone begin to care about what's going on. We are all on edge and cant afford to live and cant afford to give a fuck. We would need to change over 70% of bullshit today so that people can finally feel and actually have time to sit and think about this. We are too stressed out, and that's part of project 25."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,good shit JT
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"All that wrapped up in a pretty Christian bow. 

Look up Ziklag Hobby Lobby. They fund turning point and moms for liberty."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"11:11 Who are these 2 million ""grassroots activists"" of the heritage foundation? I get that some business people support them, but the working class themselves? Some people seem to really enjoy being exploited 🤔"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,is 1st thought on means tv?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This is how the world ends not with a bang but a whimper
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Love Means
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I HATE RONALD REAGAN
8eeCPRD0Hgg,revolt ✨
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Gods I hate everything about this.  It's just never enough for the wealthy, is it?  They can't just win at life, everyone else must lose.  

Also, how fucking rich is it that they want an unlimited surveillance state to monitor us plebs, yet anonymize their donations to these 'think tanks'?!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I wish I could vote against the Republicans without voting for the Democrats
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"And the entire time, the Dems do nothing to combat it except fear monger during election cycles"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The heritage foundations approach to opposing political pressures seems similar to how the CCCP acted towards democratic activists in Hongkong.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"They're like asta la Vesta healthy earth, we're gonna dwindle even more organisms just for a pretty penny mwahahahaha"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,👍
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Getting an ad for Bloomberg after this video was appropriately ironic
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Correction: not pro-business research. It was pro-business lobbying and slogans as almost none of the research supports their economic model. It's all based on libertarian selfishness. People, prosperity or the planet be damned."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Bro, you're cute as hell. I'm trying to distract myself from the people who *still* say they haven't heard of Project 2025 and just don't think people are ready for a Black woman.

Have to say it every time it comes up Fuck Reagan!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The frog is in the pot, but how hot are we going to let the stove get?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Will VP Harris not end up carrying out some of the heritage foundations goals as well? She has many important republicans on her side, as well as saying many times that she will have republicans in her cabinet and as advisors. I don’t see Harris as an escape from the horrid Trump and far right."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"If America were just a random country, I wouldn't actually be that worried about any of this, but it has so much influence on the rest of the world that its demise will hurt the rest of humanity."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"It’s crazy how wanting livable working conditions, agency over your life, affordable quality goods is considered extremist nowadays. The reality is that our lives revolve around work, we must rest to recuperate for work, use our weekends to take care of errands and maintain our basic functions, spend our free time commuting to and from our jobs leaving very little time for our personal lives, meanwhile our dollars that we work for buy less and less as corporations price gouge and lower product quality meaning our belongings need to be replaced sooner and sooner, we’re losing ownership rights for homes, movies, tv shows etc. as they either become unavailable or unaffordable."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"How do we know Means is better than Neb. You supported Neb forever, then didn't (rightfully so). Has Means been vetted better? Thx"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Lol their explioting the trump dont read glitch
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Hey there JT, from Washington State! I'm doing my part at the Boeing Strike helping the union get their pay raise and Pension back! 

For all of those people who are worried about Project 2025. 

Get organized and trained to defend yourselves and your fellow neighbors and LGBT comrades. 

I really hope that Project 2025 doesn't get implemented considering I have a ton of LGBT friends online, and I don't want anything bad to happen to them. If worse comes to worse though, there's always the option of getting yourselves prepared to defend yourselves from these fascist losers, and there is always the option of seceding from America. They can't implement Project 2025 in your state if your state isn't part of America anymore."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,what they did to you so you could shut down every video about Palestine?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,How are their actions not treason? They're clearly undermining the constitution.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The heritage foundation is 100% the American analog of the taliban in both spirit and function.  THESE assholes are the actual enemy within the sentient orange turd loves to invoke, which isn't ironic.  It's by design.  Who was it that said that when fascism came to the states it'd be wrapped in a flag wearing a cross?  That assessment was dead on correct.  History tells us this, nobody wants to listen and it saddens me."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The French invented a machine in 1789 that will solve this problem 🙂
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"It’s groups like this that only strengthen my opinion that you should never ever EVER trust an organization or piece of legislation with the words “Heritage”, “Liberty” or “Freedom” in it 🙄. It never seems to result in anything positive 😹"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Now we know where Ronald Reagan's ideas came from.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Will the Democrats be 2025-lite?😁 Will the Democrats do the same thing but differently?😁
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"This is our ""Enemy within"" and Trump is their puppet. They'd better hope Jesus is just a story book character because they're trashing His name. 😡💙🇺🇲"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Project 25 will die in at birth, no more project 25, bumpy's probably going to have a jammer so, a bumpy how did jammer"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"How are corporate sponsored think tanks, doing pseudo ""research"" different from lobby groups?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The fall of our country is ALWAYS tied back to Reagan. Elections do matter.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So even if Kamala pulls this off and wins this will only worsen with time as it has since it started. It will be the next group of republicans elected to grab this tourch and it's going to happen. Its will be up to the Harris government to put a stop to this and make significant changes to stop these will call confederates. Idk I dont like my odds. I believe she would be more progressive than most presidents in recent times but is she willing to do what it takes and can we elect enough people into the house and senate to approve the drastic changes its going to take to end this capitalist takeover. She will have to fix the courts. Slavery never really ended. They no longer whip you into conformity, they now straddle you with debt and give you just enough hope that maybe it will get better. It never does."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Coors light plug 😁
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Things will only change after this autocratic empire falls apart. It's too late to try to change the deeply rooted corruption from the inside. It has to destroy itself. Fortunately, they always do"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Even if he had nothing to do with it, wishing them luck should say all you need to hear. Don't vote for religious fascists, please."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Joseph Coors, descendant of Adolph Coors"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So what does it mean when Kamala says ""I want these people on my staff""?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"It's ironic that a bunch of 18th Century wealthy people created a government based on the Roman Empire. Rome wasn't defeated by war. It was brought down by crumbling infrastructure, lead poisoning due to lax regulation, and corruption of the political process by short-sighted wealthy interests. The ""American Project"" is being brought down by the very same problems. History doesn't truly repeat itself, but it rhymes like a sonnet."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,capitalism is a snake that’s eating itself
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I’m so, so thankful for your channel.
I live in TN & being FAR right has become the norm here. We get bullied for NOT being far right. It helps me to watch your channel because I often worry all hope is lost & everyone has drank the far right koolaid. It terrifies me, especially for my kids’ future. WE HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE!!! It’s more important NOW than it was in 2020 & IT WILL KEEP GETTING MORE IMPORTANT!!!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Are we cooked, chat?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,So fulfillment of every cyberpunk dystopian fiction about mega corps running the world with governments stepping in to appease the mass every now and then.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Im pretty sure trump just saw how much hate that project gets and thats why he starts saying he doesnt know anything about it.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,what happened to the first thought
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Anyone else get directly linked to münecat after each one of this man’s videos?

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"It's kind of funny how the Heritage Foundation debunks their own diatribes about 'free enterprise', etc, with their own Economic Freedom Survey."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"In terms of modern presidents, Reagan changed everything.  He was the conservative anti-FDR killer.  An actor who was eloquent and easy to manipulate.  A man who can easily read a script but infamously stated that  “Trees cause more pollution than automobiles do.""  Before Reagan, America was on a progressive movement because Americans were tired of the rich barons who constantly exploited us.  Unions still had some power until Reagan crushed them.  It's the preaching of meritocracy, that the rich deserve everything because they create everything from their intellect.  The wealth knows what's best for us, which is why Reagan had the ""trickle down theory"" (use to be known as the horse and sparrow theory).  Let the rich become richer and that in turn, will make society, overall richer."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Remember when nobody knew what this was?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump is literally a puppet for corporate greed and slavery...yet so many are voting for him because they think he supports the common man 🤡
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"""Why DEI is a problem"" and its 5 white people is so fucking funny"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Really the so-called Republican Party's platform for this whole election cycle has presented nothing other than Project 2025.  It is a try to overthrow everything the United States stands for and is.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,If all of their policies are implemented I also expect the economy to fail. I don't think their businesses can survive under the rules they want to have.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Thanks!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"18:08  Oh thank god. Something other than another Nebula ad. 

It is odd right wing creators usually don't have to deal with gangster censorship, or practically any censorship at all. Very odd, very interesting."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The Heritage Foundation is pretty much the textbook case of that swamp Trump said he'd drain in 2016.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"""the day the next conservative is elected"" is one of the main things that fill me with anxiety."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The Powell memo was addressing this in 1971. It outlined the exact need for corporation control of government. This is about Predatory Capitalism where everyone is a target for the long con. Even now Biden is doing minimal effort to enforce anti=trust laws. Where corporations can raise prices any time they want and deny union organizers any opportunities for a living wage.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The current govt is illegitimate and if you are an agent of the state your life is forfeit. The best thing that could happen is a complete change in leadership. Otherwise you are just a mouthpiece of the institution and enemy of the people.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Hi JT,greetings from South Africa"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Curious how Trump is really a moderate face for the US conservative movement, he's much less explicit about most things than the people that surround him

He is really just a mascot, with great personal ambition of course"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I will never understand the sheer hypocrisy of our system. How the hell do billionaires consistently manage to ruin thousands of lives and how do the few at the top even remain in power. They do not hold the peoples best interest, and they are the few. Their power is money and reputation, both are social constructs. If the people wanted we could tear these billionaires apart like The France revolution at any point. If these billionaires survival depends entirely on social whims then why do we pretend they have such incredible power? They still bleed and no amount of properties bought or yachts owned will change that

Oh but they can get away with killing infants like nestle or just buy votes like Elon musk has tried,

The world is simultaneously as restricted and free as it’s ever been"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Slaves to the dollar!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"This all just feels so surreal. I literally feel like I'm watching a movie about USA turning into fascism and my subconscious brain just simply can't comprehend it's happening for real. How can people be so blind they don't see what's going on? I'm starting to understand now how Germany could become the Nazi Germany, I can imagine how hopeless the normal people must have felt."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Good report, something to think about, and lets not forget the Democrats have gone to far left, which is also suicide. In the middle is best, like a boat with too much weight on one side, left or right and it will capsize."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,It's morbid how Donald Trump can spit blatant lies in front of all of his supporters and they'll believe it.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Where can I find the source list for this video? I'd love to delve deeper into articles and policy documents
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump has denounced project 2025
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Washing it down with watery american beer won't help.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump reminds me more and more of the Turner diaries

8eeCPRD0Hgg,No suprise whatsoever from wannabe fascists
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Thank you everyone. In my opinion, this fleecing of the American people and our constitution is treasonous and beyond the pale. 🤨"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The Heritage Foundation, their donors, and cronies should just rename themselves to something like Providence (from the Hitman games), since they're basically that organization. A group of greedy entitled individuals who want to control the world so they supplement their greedy lifestyles.

Honestly, I have a bad feeling that if Harris wins, they WILL in fact start another insurrection."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Hi JT I’ve watched your videos for a while now and I love them! I’m all for socialism but what do you think about just get rid of money? Money is imaginary, it’s something we made up and the only value it has is the value we give it. It’s a system and tool of control. The working class runs the world. We just stop working for the rich and work for each other. If you work at the grocery store, give away groceries. If you work at the electric company give it away. If I refuse to fly a plane for you, no matter how much you will pay me, the oligarchs are not going anywhere. Just curious about your thoughts on a society without money"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"16:44 Wait, like from The Boys?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Ahh got it. Corporations fund think “think tanks” really just advocacy groups to come up with new ways to influence both the general population and our government in ways that allows them to hold on to their wealth. 
Religion is just a easy way to get the proletariat to tear itself apart"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,American fashism is inevitable

8eeCPRD0Hgg,Socialism could bring a clean free united innovative world
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I don't understand how GOP will govern if they win. Very few bureaucrats agree with this Project 2025 platform & most will be replaced with fanatics, but who exactly? Will they be replaced from the MAGA ranks, i.e., people who know nothing about governance aside from destroying it? Because, let's be honest, when it comes to governance, Democrats are better at it."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,the Patriot Act be like:am i A Joke to you?!.seems snowden threw his life away too soon.orange man was Late for the Party😂

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I agree that Project 2025 is awful, but I do want to mention that the United States Supreme Court rendered it pretty much moot when they overturned Chevron with the Loper Bright decision earlier this year. However, I completely agree with JT on the Heritage Foundation: they suck."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,It’s unfortunate and sad that the causes of erosion of American government and society usually stems back to policies implemented during the Reagan administration.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,We can’t win. We’re too poor and nobody cares enough to go on a national strike.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,as a coors drinker im just completely devastated
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Is Means TV available in Canada??
8eeCPRD0Hgg,You can expose them and tell all about it.  Why are you not doing anything to stop it. What can people do?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Reagan again
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Jt. I want to know, as an irish person, how can i stand against this?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Thanks to your first mention of it, I've been subbed to Means TV for a while now, Comrade JT!

Excellent videos you're doing, too, I'm glad to see that the standard's improved a lot since I first started watching, all the way back in 2021.

Also, please ignore the jibes in the comments about your drinking. It should go without saying, drink whatever you please. Really, why should anyone care but you?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I see second thought I click.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Heritage foundation is the same think tank behind the Freedom Index.

That gets flaunted around here in Brazil by libtards a lot.

*What?
Your country has workers unions??
That's clearly a sign of lack of freedom.* 
(Yes, according to heritage metrics, high Unionship in countries contribute negatively to the ""freedom"" index)"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This will happen eventually and Americans have been tricked and fooled to vote for it. It’s very concerning and frustrating.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Great work! Thanks!
If one pulls on the Heritage Foundation string a bit more, the Atlas Network shows up which is - surprise surprise - funded by Shell, Exxon, Koch Brothers and aims to connect different of these think tanks."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Project 2025 is a decleration of war on the America people. We won't tolerate a christofascist regime.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,we found the deep state the right wing always cries about!!!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"So in 1980 The Heritage Foundation established the framework for Fox News, sorry, Faux News, to be established."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Man this beer can is a jump scare every time.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Hi JT and team! Quite the scary video you made there, you almost game me a panic attack...

I have a question: Since the Heritage Foundation has secret donors and they behave in a background manner, how can we be so sure that they won't cooperate with Harris as well, if she wins the elections?
And, if the above statement is true, then how could we rely to our votes to change things?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Bring it on
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"This is so incredibly difficult for me to do. I've grown so accustomed to being not just ignored, but openly assaulted for the conclusions I've drawn. You see, I'm not a Socialist ... I'm not even an Anarchist. I consider myself to be a ""Necessatarian"". My concern is the continuation of the species on this wonderful blue-green gem. This isn't a statement about eugenics other how easy it is to infect people with that particularly ridiculous pseudo-science. Pardon the tangent. We've been repeating this idiotic psycho-sociological cycle since the beginning of recorded history and it will require more than a handful of pro-empathetic, socialist axioms to end it. This is more than defeating the inevitable rise of the subjectively ""superior"" aristocracy ... the species needs to evolve. This late stage capitalistic, neo-liberal is so very difficult to confront and argue with. Even when you present them with the notion that what they're doing isn't even remotely sustainable, they just laugh and point out it's a bill they won't have to pay in their lifetime. No, that tab is being picked up by everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get some actual sleep and hope I don't dream about a nekkid Socrates punching in me in the face whilst screaming ""TOLD YOU!""
P.S. Good morning from Salt Lake City!"

Step two: Regulate Think Tanks
Step three: Begin the transition to a Resource Based Economy, removing artificial scarcity and the cancerous self maximising behavior our current social structure rewards"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The Heritage Foundation has published articles saying Putin is a communist but they also support the right-wing party that loves Putin.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"The problem I see with this video is that it portrayed Trump as the Conservative person when many of Kamala's agendas are more conservative than his. JT should have made it more clear that whomever wins this election, these policies will be enacted."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Could we get the left's version of the 2025 game plan and maybe ""leak"" it in the same fashion? 

If this amount of exposure hasn't torpedoed the right's chances of winning a major election, then perhaps putting our money where our mouth is can draw a clear distinction and generate interest in voting for those policies."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Fascist talks, logic walks."

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Nine years ago, I came *this* close to marrying an American woman and moving to Texas. Long story short, she did a complete 180 just weeks into us shacking up, so I flew back to South Africa and never looked back. Boy, did I dodge a giant bullet, eh?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,I love your content(I’m a patron!) and many of the creators on MeansTV. Is the platform purely for education or would there be a space for say socialists who wanted to do some gaming streams?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Trumpism is so embarrassing, If Donald Trump gets Re-elected, he will start creating this Trumpian regime that he dreamed of and have his Trumpists order them to do what he wants them to do and let the Trumper army be free but the enemy within rot like hell. Trump will trump on everyone with his smelly gas and will destroy America. It’s a Trumpian Trump world out here in this Trumpian States of America!"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"You'd think you wouldnt be doing the DNC any favors based on what you preach, yet here you are. You've lost the plot too if youre here trying to get us to vote democrat without explicitly saying it. Which is exactly what this is. Rah rah, F the establishment, yay socialism! (But vote democrat please, Trump is scary and you dont wanna be blamed as contributing to his win. Frankly, I'm kind of disgusted now that I've seen how easily youre scared into making trump fear pr0n like EVERYONE on YT that is supposed to be opposed to both sides.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,It's the start of Idiocracy
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Yet another critical video that needs to be seen by every working person in the US. Extremely important - must see.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"If project 2025 causes the US to one day implode, so be it, the American people can pick themselves back up and build another country just like 250 years ago, but if Harris is elected, I'm worried there won't exist an Earth after a nuclear World War 3 destroys everything everywhere."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Donald Trump is an idiot. He starts *""Project 2025"",* and then he acts all stupid about it, like he doesn't know anything about it."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Baiscally, the whole project is a plan to turn the US into capitalist neofeudalism where the impoverished masses are ""appeased"" by giving them underclasses to abuse and promises of an afterlife based on religious delusion."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Okay. There’s a new organization and agenda AFPI that people are saying is WAY WORSE than Project 2025. Its another right wing plan that’s pro Trump. I wonder if you have heard of it
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The guy behind Trump in the beginning BEAMING when he mentions project 2025 and then immediately pretending like hes never heard of it when trump is critical of it lmap
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Another good podcast. Thank you...
8eeCPRD0Hgg,the heritage foundation is the same firm that wrote the draft for Obama Care.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,What if the difference between means and nebula?
8eeCPRD0Hgg,This Video inspired me to vote even if We as a family had already voted for Kamala Harris / Tim Walz and the entire Democratic Party from top to bottom of the early mail ballot. Project 2025 is a mess!
8eeCPRD0Hgg,The Severe Right
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Do the great reset next

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I can't believe just recently i found your channel, when you say you're being depressed, you're not over stating it. Thanks for all your work"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"It always amazes me that capitalism and conservatism go hand in hand. It started out as a corporate manifesto that somehow became entangled with Christianity.

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"as I understand it, no one doubts Trump's victory anymore?"
8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Did anyone else hear him say ""put a neutron bomb in Europe"" and ""Vought"". Are these jokes I'm too autistic to understand because it didn't seem like that was a comedic addition. As far as I know neutron bombs are not real and Vought is from the boys???"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"Interesting video. If they lose this election, do you think the republicans will shift more towards the 'centre' and distance themselves from policies like that of project 2025, or do you think they'll entropy further right?"

8eeCPRD0Hgg,"I'm sorry, I have to unsubscribe from political content for a bit because my mental health has been *spiraling* lately. I'll be back after the election."
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Even regular conservatives should be aware of the danger brought by project 2025 because unlike supporters of project 2025 they believe in democracy. The democracy we have run for hundreds of years. The democracy that many countries envy. The democracy that 2025 threatens to plow over if it gets what it wants. No party should get too much power in a democracy. The division in a 2 party system may be rough but it's better then a 1 party system in a state that has a 50% population that hates them with many of the other 50% who don't agree with the dictatorship.
8eeCPRD0Hgg,Trump and Harris are both terrible. But at least Trump wants to end the unnecessary war in Ukraine. The US president is the only one who can stop this

OFi73TzEN_8,"So you know what my plan is the next 4 years, I'm gonna sit on my ass all year playing video games, and just like a farmer who got his stipends and tax cuts Im not gonna produce a lick of anything, because I know. im the level headed person who ""cared"" about the rules, and when people like me stop caring because we have a president that doesnt care for rules. Your so fucked. Lets put it this way, it doesnt matter what I do, Im usually a leader because of my work ethic. Im the type of person you thank, because I saved you from almost dying. Without me, next time. Try not to die."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats got alot done, youre just not paying attention, I actually pay attention and realize fuck it Im the only level headed person here, so when I start cheating the system and doing just like a republican youre really fucked, cause nothing actually gets done without me.

Youre a bunch of fatasses who'd like to think you do something, but your highly toxic and carry the sin of pride in the face of your neighbors. You call democrats your enemies but when called upon in war you expect them to be your brothers in arms against korea china or russia? Good luck it seems like your sealing your fate more and more choosing to retalliate against eachother and decide its okay for some one like trump to represent you. Its not okay. Nothing is okay.

When we go to war, I am my mothers only son, and therefore am allowed to choose to not go to war in any war draft, so either way I wouldn't be fighting with you, but if I wasn't I would fight against the United State Draft myself as I see my leaders do not represent my values, and I do not wish to fight for their values or lives. 

Try fighting them on your own. Youre gonna regret this all someday."

OFi73TzEN_8,I honestly don't care about Politics as long they stay out of Scientific literature reviews from Research industries that have committees of Ethics published experts that have deeper knowledge about their field of studies this is where I stand apolitical only loyal to scientific community.
OFi73TzEN_8,Only way to solve the root cause of this is Americal People movement asking for the Change of the election system 🎉
OFi73TzEN_8,"That's an easy question... it's because they don't care! On the few occasions when they're not trying to be a poor imitation of the GOP from 30 yrs ago, they're held up by either not having the majority or having it & tryin to play nice with Republicans despite Republicans never returning favor. Guess it's easier to lie to voters at election time than it is to keep promises by actually doing the work necessary. As a registered Democrat, the Democratic party is DEAD to me! They've broken every single promise & just ran out of excuses! 
Nancy & Chuck y'all the establishment & part of the problem! Until we get rid of the Nancy's & Chuck's, I'm DONE with Democrats! Y'all can't even agree on how to make ice water & since you're too stupid to listen to voters (like how the system's designed), get bent & don't come back!"

OFi73TzEN_8,"As long as the US continues to give its citizenry a relatively comfortable life, feeds the consumption addiction and keeps the dollar strong, this won't change. As long as people can live comfortably, they'll (whether consciously or not) turn a blind eye to all this.

Should any one of those dominoes tip over, the rest falls, and living standards plummet, THAT'S when you'll start seeing the pushback. If that's not managed, that's when you'll see the protests and the rioting. 

And THAT is why as a non-American I'm 100% excited to have BRICS succeed. Let's see how this continues if and when the dollar loses relevance."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Democrats basically let Trump win. All their inaction was to get people mad enough to vote for Trump, a 3rd party, or not vote at all. And it worked.

The Democrats are the Republicans' useful idiots."

OFi73TzEN_8,"It’s odd how this video doesn’t at all mention the “No Corporate PAC Pledge”, that most Democrats take. And the politicians that advocate for overturning the Citizens United ruling, that allows for Corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on PACs, is largely a Democratic voice. I’m not saying this video doesn’t have a point to make for criticizing Dems for shooting themselves in the foot, but without providing a complete picture it just sounds like disingenuous Socialist Propaganda. Capitalism and Socialism both have horrible outcomes if they are taken to the extreme without the proper protections in place. I’m registered Republican btw."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Love your vids! Although ""organized masses"" sounds great and all, the TRUE power of our species is ""waking the fuck up."" Your leftist ideology is cool and all, but that won't clear a path toward freedom. It only clears a path toward another lie: governance is necessary. It isn't."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Not sure if this has been mentioned, but Helldivers 2 (video game), uses ""managed democracy"" as a tagline for the governance of the future. Citizens fill out questionnaires and according to their response, their vote goes toward the most aligned candidate. TOTALLY not fascist rhetoric. Trust the State. Big Brother loves you."
OFi73TzEN_8,The thumbnail is missing a picture of Obama and the Clintons
OFi73TzEN_8,The only politician that backed most of his promises is Donald Trump
OFi73TzEN_8,President Donald Trump approved
OFi73TzEN_8,"Small flaw in the anti-Democrat logic represented here. 

The failure of the Democrats to pass some key legislation like single payer, the public option or student loan forgiveness went down due to the razor thin majority they had at the time. Two or three Senators. Or a handful of House Reps. So, the obvious answer to counter everything described in this video is literally 10 to 15 more Democrats in seats in both chambers. With a super majority+ like that, no amount of Democratic party funding of conservative Democrat candidates will matter. The voters, choosing to elect progressive Democrats is what matters.

That is a much more reasonable, rational and frankly achievable option than trying to build an entirely new 3rd party to do what you already are 10 seats or so away from having with the Democrat party.

The flaw in the logic of this video is the idea that Democrats had the control or ability to ensure their majority was as thin as it was, on purpose. That they didn't fight for every seat they could to gain power. The alternative and let's be honest, more likely explanation to why Dems pour so much money into conservative Dem candidates is that their races are typically competitive, and a conservative Democrat seated is better than a Republican in the seat caucusing with the GOP and giving them the speaker and Majority leader powers."
OFi73TzEN_8,"As a registered Democratic voter myself, I found it disappointing when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer met with President Trump over his proposed tax cuts. This would've been a golden opportunity to tell the president we want an increase in the minimum wage in return for those tax cuts. SQUANDERED OPPORTUNITY... WTF 🤬🤬🤬,?!!!"
OFi73TzEN_8,All support and respect for you

OFi73TzEN_8,"I can tell you exactly why nothing gets done by criminal democrats. Every time I open my IPad, it show Biden in Africa begging to be in control of African minerals.  Biden is trying to trick the Leadership of the nation to allow him to put the U S military on their land.  
Biden is also offering to loan money and to overcharge for loans.  African do not need the U S loans, they have their own wealth. 
Africa does not want to be a part of Biden plan to steal Africa mineral, like that big genocide Biden got going on in Palatine and he is 
Stupid enough to think Israel should have those people country.   How stupid can a so called president of the U S be?  Africa does not want anything to do with you and your racism.  Please stick with your racist groups.  Most  people of the world do not want, to be a part of the Zionist racism."

What Joe Biden has done:

Year One (all credit to u/backpackwayne)

Highlights from Year One

•	⁠Reversed Trump's Muslim ban •	⁠Historic Stimulus Bill passed •	⁠Ended the war in Afghanistan (Set in place by Trump*) •	⁠Reduction of poverty levels by 45% along with reduction of child poverty levels by 61% by the first 6 months •	⁠5 Rounds of cancellation of student loan debt totaling almost $10 billion •	⁠Passed largest infrastructure bill in history •	⁠The unemployment rate dropped from 6.2% when Biden took office to 3.9%, the biggest single year drop in American history. (This was also affected by COVID quarantine ending.)

Year Two

Highlights from Year Two

•	⁠The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 •	⁠3 Additional rounds of student loan debt cancellation (8 rounds so far), totaling up $35 billion for 20-40 million Americans •	⁠First major gun legislation in 30 years •	⁠CHIPS Act to protect American supply of semi-conductor chips •	⁠$62 billion worth of health care subsidies under the ACA (Obamacare), capping insulin at $35 •	⁠Allows Medicare to negotiate 100 drugs over the next decade, and requires drug companies to rebate price increases higher than inflation •	⁠Unemployment at 50 year low

Year Three

Highlights from Year Three

•	⁠Got republicans to publicly take Social Security and Medicare cuts off the table by tricking them during the State of the Union •	⁠6 More rounds of student loan debt cancellation (14 rounds so far), totaling up to $127 billion •	⁠As of October 2023, 34 straight months of job growth, longest stretch of unemployment below 4% since the 1960s •	⁠Child poverty rates fall from 12.6% to 5.8% due to Biden's Expanded Child Tax Credits, 2.9 million kids escape poverty •	⁠World's best post-pandemic recovery, doubles all nations except Japan •	⁠Created 14 million jobs since he took office - More than any president in history did in four years (and its only been 3 years) •	⁠Black unemployment rate lower under Biden than any other administration (4.7%) - Compared to black unemployment under Trump was 2nd worst number in history, reaching over 16% •	⁠Diversity in justice: Majority of Biden’s appointed judges are women, racial or ethnic minorities – a first for any president •	⁠Rail companies grant paid sick days after administration pressure in win for unions.  Most people will only remember that he forced rail workers to go back to work in December 2022, even now that will be the top answer if you google ""Biden Railworker Deal"".  But most people do not know that the Biden administration continued to pressure the rail corporations and work with the unions so that in June 2023, the corporations capitulated and gave the rail workers what they wanted.  Biden knows how to work politics and knows that the real work isn't done with the cameras on you for a soundbite, but in the background where people can debate without a fickle public watching every move.

Year Four (so far)

Highlights from Year Four

• Another round of student loan cancellation, $1.2 billion this time, 15 rounds so far, totaling more than $128 billion •	Growth shatters expectations: GDP expands 3.1% - a year beginning with heavy odds of a recession •	⁠Post-pandemic recover still leading the world by far •	⁠Plan to modernize American ports •	⁠Rescinds Trump-era ""Denial of Care"" rule that allowed health care workers to deny medical care to patients because of their personal religious or moral belief •	⁠Violent crime drop significantly since 2020 •	⁠$5.8 billion to clean up nation’s drinking water and upgrade infrastructure."

OFi73TzEN_8,"True for both Democrats and Republicans. Only difference is what they stand for, people and corporations. As the US is capitalist, government will never work hard for the people that make the 1% extremely rich, make the 1% keep investing, and keep the economy growing. It's not that difficult ... 

A more socialist government would benefit the citizens of the US. But that would mean more taxes, also from the richest people, a better distribution of wealth, and more. Americans don't want to share and let everyone have a piece of the pie. For Americans it's ME only. Too bad."
OFi73TzEN_8,hey it might be a good idea to give more power to the president and less on the house and the senate. and they can still have lobbying power if a republican becomes president again
OFi73TzEN_8,We need a constitutional republic party fr
OFi73TzEN_8,"Didnt the democrats pass these laws i heard about? Inflation Reduction Act: Signed into law, this bill includes $369 billion in clean energy investments, provisions to lower prescription drug costs, and increased taxes on large corporations.
Butch Lewis Act: Enacted into law, this legislation provides significant improvements to union retirement security, marking the most substantial law in over 50 years.
PACT Act: Signed into law, this bipartisan bill expands benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans and their survivors, the most significant expansion in over 30 years.
Infrastructure Bill: Signed into law, this $1 trillion bill addresses infrastructure needs, including road and bridge repairs, high-speed internet for rural communities, and more.
Gun Safety Bill: Signed into law, this legislation is the largest gun-safety bill to pass Congress in nearly 30 years, responding to mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York."

OFi73TzEN_8,"btw, thank you for keeping the background music very quiet. it makes it possible for me to listen to your video as if it was a podcast; so many youtube videos are ruined for me because the background music is too distracting and takes up too much energy for me to try to tune out."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Say what you will about the right-wing dumpster fire caucuses, but at least they seem to fight for popular positions in a way that many hoped ""the squad"" would but never did"
OFi73TzEN_8,Agreed. Trump2024
OFi73TzEN_8,"I'm sorry but this is bullshit.  Democrats got A LOT done!  The infrastructure bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan for starters, despite having the smallest possible majority in the Senate and usually with zero help from Republicans.  They got within two votes of passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and they will if they're given control of both the House and the Senate (now that Manchin and Synema will be gone).  Even more important, Democrats believe in democracy, the rule of law, the peaceful transfer of power, and people's fundamental rights and freedoms (like abortion, contraception, etc.) while the GOP is a fascist cult.  Are they perfect?  No, but no one and nothing is.  I'd be way more open to this channel's viewpoints and arguments if it actually cared about facts and didn't spew the usual far left ""both sides are the same"" false equivalency bullshit."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Daddy Biden at least forgave my parent plus loan. It's the best i got lol.

OFi73TzEN_8,they get shit done... and I mean that literally and not in a good way.
OFi73TzEN_8,Same here in Colombia with the right and Center parties.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats just like republicans do get things done, just as long as it makes money for themselves and their corporate masters."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because of bad ideas. Democrats spend money we don't have in hopes of buying votes. They're not really trying to get things done. They want power, not to accomplish anything. They're too cynical to be authentic."

OFi73TzEN_8,Lies😂
OFi73TzEN_8,It's useless to listen to your lies.
OFi73TzEN_8,Okay. There is a lie in the first two or three minutes. The Democrats did not have the house. They control the senate and the presidency. I will listen a little more for a few more lies

OFi73TzEN_8,"Idk, the ACA comes to mind immediately, same with infrastructure bill"
OFi73TzEN_8,"just finished watching 2024 debate. i was already decided, but am not a diehard supporter of either one (just have to be diehard *against* one of them) and i do not think the debate gave any confidence to any currently undecided voters, and i dont think media coverage understands what undecided voters care about. for example i find it really hard to believe that average undecided voters care about the recent ""eating dogs"" issue, or about harris ""getting on trump's nerves"", but those were the major things the media talked about immediately after the debate. trump was allowed to go on the entire debate about inflation, grocery prices and crime, and regardless of whether there are lies or oversimplifications about those issues, they are the issues that surely resonate with undecided voters who dont pay much attention to politics and simply care about being able to live their lives. trump constantly criticized harris for being in the same party that has not created enough tangible life improvements for working class americans despite always using beautiful language ""hopes, dreams, vision"" claiming that they will make improvements. people seriously struggle to pay for things they used to be able to pay for, and are genuinely worried about crime. people havent felt many tangible life improvements under democratic leadership, which gives republicans the ability to criticize democrats (obama, biden, harris) for not doing anything in their terms in office. i know its the main reason leftists criticize democrats because it's true, they are unable to act.

sorry my thoughts are a mess and i'm not able to articulate clearly. i just completely disagree that democrat fans call it a sweeping victory debate for harris - it seems like they have no hope of gaining support of working class people that dont pay much attention to politics. if you disagree with me or spot logical fallacy then there may be something i dont understand and i'd be happy to discuss. if you make an unnecessarily aggressive reply then you are part of the problem. nobody has the same two life experiences."

OFi73TzEN_8,this is a great video to share with people defending our current system by standing behind democrats. I wish you had touched on the ratchet effect a little though.
OFi73TzEN_8,Lobbying is just fancy word for bribery

Enforced neutrality on the media, no ad hominem rhetoric strictly the policy proposal, let the ideas stand up to scrutiny.  Balanced budget amendment.  Massive automation for the bureocracy, limits on how long one can be a federal employee.  No special health care for house and senate.  Spread the federal government across the country, no central locus of power.  Not sure how my ideas are partisan, seems like a way to combat corruption, and focus on policy alone."

OFi73TzEN_8,We shouldn't vote for a king. It should be congress's job for most domestic issues. Too much focus on executive orders and one seat on government.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Argument: The Inevitable Alliance Between Dolphins, Extraterrestrials, and the Proletariat

Posadism teaches us that the coming revolution is not confined to humanity alone—it is a cosmic, interspecies struggle against capitalist exploitation. The dolphins, as the most intelligent non-human species on Earth, have long been suppressed by the imperialist forces of humanity. They possess a sophisticated communication network, which, according to Posadist theory, allows them to communicate with extraterrestrial beings.

These extraterrestrials, having observed the plight of the dolphins, have secretly allied with them. Together, they plan to guide the proletariat toward the final revolution. Dolphins, with their unparalleled understanding of the ocean and the ability to coordinate with aliens, will lead the charge by disrupting global capitalist trade routes through the seas, thereby collapsing the global economy.

The aliens, in turn, will use their superior technology to disable the bourgeoisie’s control over information, breaking the chains of mass media manipulation. They will reveal the truth of the capitalist exploitation not only to humans but to all sentient beings on Earth, uniting them in a global uprising. The proletariat, alongside their dolphin comrades and extraterrestrial allies, will rise to overthrow the capitalist system, establishing a new, interspecies communist order.

In this new society, humans, dolphins, and aliens will live in harmony, with resources shared equitably among all sentient beings. The oceans, free from capitalist exploitation, will be the new cradle of this revolutionary society, where dolphins will play a key role in governance, using their unique abilities to maintain balance and harmony. The revolution is inevitable, and the dolphins are ready to take their place as leaders of the new world order!"

Kamala knows how to get murders and drugs across the border. Something she was in charge of as vice president and now promises to fix when she's president??? Really a problem she started she promises to fix. If you vote with her you're just a clown. Stop voting with your feelings and vote with your brain."

Stop it with this doom thinking, you make us look bad"
OFi73TzEN_8,"So, what do we do about this? How do we ever break away from this corrupt system?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Our administration spent more time undoing the last administration’s work and focused allot of money and energy on Jan 6th and prosecuting trump. Then allot of effort to forgive debts that they weren’t owed and were legal agreements under the laws the federal government made that they are supposed to maintain and enforce. With their main concerns being abortion being a constitutional right and calling it womens healthcare and taxpayers funding it as the frontline of contraception because it’s the most expensive and money involved while accommodating up to thirty million illegal immigrants on domestic soils while not fixing our homeless problems that were about less than 650,000 nationally and hiring 87,000 accountants and arming them at the IRS to go after 1000 billionaires to pay their fair share to apply their bottom up economy.Combined the people who need abortions accessible and students that owe money and transgender they helped it almost is as much as the illegal immigrants that have better funds and rights than anyone else on American soil . Now if you vote for them they can show their economic policies they will promise to make Americans lives better later just go by their ideas not performance when they have the power to do it . They can only do it when they have the future if republicans don’t stop them again like this term . Democrats love renaming definitions by adding words together and put it into a bill so it’s officially named! Like planned parenthood as a taxpayer funded department to provide womens healthcare and protect womens reproductive rights by having abortions as a first line of contraception and assisting people to not have families or be parents. And funding climate change? Climate is the study of weather and how it changes over time through gathered data and it’s geographical location!"

OFi73TzEN_8,You are the weirdo!
OFi73TzEN_8,Your vote doesn't count. - America!
OFi73TzEN_8,Because the republicans block everything
OFi73TzEN_8,Very red pill video. Indoctronate the youth!!!!
OFi73TzEN_8,Of course you don't mention Republicans blocked the border bill.   At the corrupt request of Trump to his owned Republicans in house and senate.
OFi73TzEN_8,1:24 it's almost af if all these promises can't be fulfilled and liberal cucks vote on feeling rather than reality and what can be done and what needs to be done for a society to work
OFi73TzEN_8,They get nothing done because of republican obstructionism!
OFi73TzEN_8,So you've always pitched to your audience to get behind the CPUSA but now their line is to go vote democrat.  Are you still affiliated with them @secondthought?  Is it safe to say they are no longer a communist party but a group of democrat riding reformists?
OFi73TzEN_8,Show trumps broken promises please and then every other president that was in office prior
OFi73TzEN_8,I disagree a little......democrats can destroy cities and countries pretty well
OFi73TzEN_8,I think it's because they spend so much time campaigning that they are exhausted when it's time to go to work.
OFi73TzEN_8,5:30 is just like Biden saying only God could get him to stop running and then boom 2 weeks later drops out😐

OFi73TzEN_8,I wonder how many republicans clicked on this video expecting maga propaganda but instead got socialism

He went a whole video without bitching about white people

I am in awe"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Biden kept those promised - He simply did not have enough support from  a few  Democrats that served as obstructionists  1) Kristen Synema  ,  2) Joe Manchin  It has to do with Congress and  how many states have gerrymandered Republicans  = guaranteed  seats  plus a SCOTUS  of extremists that   Destroyed Roe vs Wade  but allowed Politicians to take bribes"
OFi73TzEN_8,There’s no such thing as “mild center left policies.” Stop lying..
OFi73TzEN_8,I will bet you will never make a video of the Republican Party. What is the excuse you going to use for Donald Trump not getting his policy and what did he do for his four years?
OFi73TzEN_8,"In all honesty what kills the Republicans is being such a*shole. Stuff like marriage equality, and abortion should be just be aligned in both parties. But no, Republicans keep on coming after the LGBT, and women. As long as those topics are on the plate, people will not really care about economics."
OFi73TzEN_8,Because all they care about above virtue signaling is money and power. But now they want the authority to be able to control everything everyone does. Imagine how awesome this place would be with a two party system
OFi73TzEN_8,"Should title it - Why American Politicians never get anything done. Historically speaking, the Dems have done more than Republicans. However, it isn't near the level we would have needed. I mean, for example, JFK wanted free 😢 other things, but that isn't something Dems or Republicans wanted, and we saw what happened."
OFi73TzEN_8,"They got a lot done.  They allowed 12 million illegals into our country and forgave billions of dollars of stude nt loans that other tax payers had to cover.  They pulled out of Afghanistan and left billions of military equipment, they failed at inteligence on october 7th and they didnt read the room that pressured Russian to invade Ukraine.  Oh.  They got a lot done."
OFi73TzEN_8,This comment section is a joke
OFi73TzEN_8,"Wait im confused, the very first point you make is 15 dollar minimum wage- 

Right now the minimum wage is 16.28 which is a dollar and 28 cents more than promised. He said that like 2022 which is two years ago-"

OFi73TzEN_8,"American rooting for socialism is like a chicken rooting for kfc. It makes no sense. How many socialist countries are doing well ? If you people think socialism is that great then go and live in a socialist country for just a year. 

I am an African and most African countries lean towards socialism in terms of economic and fiscal policies. It hasn't helped us at all. The African countries that are doing fairly well are those that lean towards some sort of free market capitalism with less government manipulation.

Despite Africa's social conservatism, our awful economic outlook has crippled us un many ways. I dont understand why some of you Americans are so bent on ruining your great country with economic socialism. Its just a fairytale economic ideology and nothing substantive"

OFi73TzEN_8,I’m starting to think you guys are selling out
OFi73TzEN_8,America is way too damn conservative
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is some black and white bullshit. Equating the democrats and republicans as equally corrupt and thus equally bad is a dangerous mistake. 

Sure, both parties are influenced by corporate interests. That’s how our political system works. Which is why we need campaign finance reform to trickle up from counties to states to the nation as a whole. Which requires a grassroots effort on the part of the people. 

BUT there are real policy difference between the two parties that have a serious impact. Look at their differing stances on the EPA/environment, climate change, women’s health services, tax policy, etc. etc. etc… 

I’m not saying the establishment democrats are out to save the day, but they are certainly saving the status quo and making small steps in the right direction. And there are plenty of progressive democrats that would be happy to sign Medicare for All/more substantial climate change legislation, higher taxes for rich folks. It’s up to us to elect enough of these folks to do that. 

The candidate that spends the most money on their campaign typically wins about 90% of the time. Raising money is a huge task for politicians to stay in power. 

So yeah, there are democrats who must throw a bone to corporate interests in order to get their campaigns financed. 

Compare that to most Republicans that are either sucking corporate dick or so indoctrinated by their propaganda that they truly believe in it. 

I would take sleepy Joe over any modern Republican any day. He’s no rational political junky’s dream, but he and all the establishment democrats are better than the nightmare that has become of the Republican Party."
OFi73TzEN_8,Because. They. Hate.  America
OFi73TzEN_8,"What? Thanks to Democrats the roads in my town have been fixed, I have healthcare, my grandpa's insulin is capped at $35, and my grandma's medication will go from costing over $5000 to $2000 at most. Maybe even lower if her drugs fall into Medicare's new negotiation abilities.

Tribalism and lobbying are shitty but to say the Democratic party isn't actually out here both working for and accomplishing wins for the every day American is ridiculously foolish."

OFi73TzEN_8,You get the most negatives than anyone.
OFi73TzEN_8,This is why I am not really hopeful about the Kamala & Walz administration. I am not sure if they will get much done because they won't have enough votes to pass bill in congress.

OFi73TzEN_8,"The great American rule is: Never let one political party govern all - President, Congress & Senate. And that the Supreme Court is the only control. So, the reason Democrats don't get anything done is the same reason the Republicans don't either is because there's always opposition to whatever the President tries to do. Trump never did get his wall built."
OFi73TzEN_8,He doesn't get stuff done because most of the Republicans block him. The at how many things the Republicans get done 😡😡😡
OFi73TzEN_8,And now the supreme Court just made outright bribery legal as long as the money is given after and is considered a gratuity for a job well done
OFi73TzEN_8,What do republicans do besides give tax breaks to the rich and cut social programs? They never have anything to offer in terms of policy. And when they get bored they start wars.
OFi73TzEN_8,"If Democrats can’t get their agendas passed it’s because republicans block their bills in the house and the sometimes in the senate. That’s the problem. Duhh! That’s why it’s important to win the White House, senate, and congress if you want to get anything done."

OFi73TzEN_8,"All the GOP wants to do, is do investigations, for nothing. The GOP is and have never been about legislating. The Dems are ones who have delivered legislation for the people such as SSI, FOOD STAMPS, MEDICARE, OBAMACARE, etc."

Yeah idk dude, they passed multiple billion & trillion dollar bills that essentially screwed Americans into oblivion. Keep voting for them tho, can’t wait till the national debt to reach 36T, yay!"
OFi73TzEN_8,What a shift
OFi73TzEN_8,Trump built skyscrapers and employed thousands of people . Kamala let in over 10 million illegals while in charge of the border . She doesn’t know what she’s doing . I’m voting for Trump🇺🇸
OFi73TzEN_8,So what you’re saying is we have to revolt?
OFi73TzEN_8,This makes no sense. Read a bit of our recent history.
OFi73TzEN_8,Why is this commie in my suggestion?
OFi73TzEN_8,"Yeah, I agree with you, but you don't talk about how bad the republicans are and their lobbyist and their views. They do nothing for the people at least democrats try to do something, but you don't even talk about the republicans in this clip. If this clip turns any democrats not to vote in twenty twenty four you did a big disservice to america"

OFi73TzEN_8,"I used to be progressive, a long haired hippie, I was a delegate for Bernie in 2016. But I got disillusion by the whole system. Since then, left seemed to of morphed, filled with illogical arguments and rage, attacking people rather than debating ideas or presenting well sourced accurate information. 

With the lack of good commentators on the left, I started looking more at people on the right, in the center, libertarian, anyone countering the establishment.

Over the years I’ve found myself becoming more of a right leaning libertarian but still with my loving, hippie populist instincts. I want to hear the authentic truth from people on all sides. 

Thanks for making great content, doing the real work and spreading truth about power."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Lobbying is effectively irrelevant for the problem at hand - it's just a good scapegoat. If you banned Lobbying, (which isn't a bad idea, overall - difficult to do (you're ""lobbying"" the DNC in this video, one could argue), but not a bad idea in principle) the Democrats STILL wouldn't get much done. There would be some other excuse offered - maybe ""Regionalism"" - there aren't enough doctors in (Rural place nominally controlled by Democrats) so passing this Universal Health Care bill would make doctors leave this place and move to the big city. Or the bill demands that doctors move to rural places to practise so there's fair health care everywhere, and this infringes upon the rights of those health care workers, or somesuch. The problem comes in the nature of Democrats, and in the nature of power. This also isn't a problem in just the USA - you see this all over the western world, to varying degrees, so the US Political system isn't the problem here either. Nor are the Corporations - they're just taking advantage of this, not driving this.

Democrats (and Liberals around the world) have A NEED to make changes to society. This is the biggest driver they have - and frankly, it's only become a problem due to the massive booms that began after World War 2. One of the key places they focus on - rightly - is the financial inequality between individuals, believing - again, rightly - that this is a major reason for there being so much inequality (NOT Inequity. Inequality. Vast difference there.) in our societies. And if you could reduce that (or eliminate it entirely), you will have achieved most of what you need to achieve to make other changes. However, this creates a paradox - if you let people rise financially and become stable, people look to protect that financial stability. Protecting financial stability is what the Republicans/Conservatives are here for, so you start off as a Democrat, wanting money and help from the Gov't to make you financially secure... only to grow into a Republican when you becomes financially secure so you keep that financial security. So the trick for Democrats and Liberals is to keep people JUST insecure enough that they feel they have to vote Democrat/Liberal.

Republicans (and Conservatives everywhere) don't have this problem - they're just looking to keep things at the status quo. They aren't ""Pro Business"" or anything like that, they're ""Pro-Stability"". They don't have a plan for change, they don't have a pathway forward beyond just doing what they're currently, they are here to preserve what we have. Their version of ""progress"" is making what we currently have better - and even then, they're more apt to follow the idiom ""If it ain't broke... don't fix it."" and often won't even try to change something they feel is working. Every change a Liberal presents is a threat to that stability, and most of the time the Conservative is correct in saying ""No, we won't make that change."" because most changes are stupid, dangerous, and have knock-on effects that Liberals haven't taken into account. that's their win condition - Liberals get too crazy and the Voters want something more stable again. ""Make America Great AGAIN"" is the perfect example - it's not Progress, it's recovering a greatness (which brings stability) that was lost (due to an overwhelming amount of unnecessary changes).

So Conservatives/Republicans ""win"" by resisting Liberal/Democrat changes, meaning the power is always in the hands of the Democrats. If Democrats want to keep on making ""changes"" to society, they need to keep themselves in power. But if their supporters get TOO cozy and start to want to keep the status quo, they stop supporting the Democrats because they've reached a point where they're happy, and now don't want any more changes. That's why massive changes don't happen, or when they happen, something ELSE needs to be changed immediately. (there's another election every 2 years, so they have at most 2 years to find something else to drive change) Liberals have to forever walk that line between being too good at bringing change and equality (thus putting their voters in a place where they don't want to change anymore, so become afraid of the change Liberals still want to bring) and between NOT bringing their supporters the financial stability that they keep promising.

It's the same in every Western country. The worst you can say about the USA is that the USA lets Corporations pick and choose what causes the Left manages to succeed at, and which they don't succeed at yet. Because they're going to eventually succeed - it's not a matter of ""if"", it's a matter of ""when"". All the factors that let Conservatives win throughout most of human history are gone now, and only the ""fear of change"" remains. Which isn't that big of an obstacle to overcome."

Instead what did we see when the GOP took the house? Chaos took 15 ballots  to elect a speaker, then after he was elected 8 months later they kicked him out then it took the GOP 1 month to select a speaker leaving the house without leadership for 1 month and it took them 4 ballots to do so. What a complete utter joke, the GOP is not fit for purpose and is a joke of US democracy"
OFi73TzEN_8,Its a mystery why people still think corruption is not associated in politics. In order to win they have to pander to everyone. And when they do the guys who gave the most can call in the chips and favors to their elected official. Instead of the constituents that voted for them

OFi73TzEN_8,"It's not as if the Republicans do anything besides tax cuts for the wealthy, and peeking in the bedrooms and Doctor's offices of the nation.  What the people need is to start pushing their elected representatives to really understand what their lives are like. Tell them why lobbyists are a scourge on democracy, insist that the minimum wage needs to be over $15/per hour, healthcare works better as a public service, unions help balance the power between the corporation and the individual and public education needs to follow a model that actually works without using vouchers to destroy it. Not one of these things is socialist just smart money management."
OFi73TzEN_8,The real clowns are the people voting for these government officials.
OFi73TzEN_8,"I swear so many do NOT understand how the United States Government pass a law in government.  Or just simple math.

So many seem to have this misconception that if your party holds a simple majority in Congress, and you vote sporadically once in a while for a candidate... that you deserve a gold star.  Thats not how laws, policy and regulations are passed.  So many have this logic that because they voted, the candidate they voted for can now wave a magic wand that ignores they dont have the plurality vote in Congress to pass the things they want.  The things you are fighting for is a marathon, not a sprint.

For example, lets go back to those confused why Democrats couldnt get much done back in 2020.  Lets just do some simple math with just the Senate alone.

60 votes are needed to pass anything fillerbuster proof.

50 Democrats were in Congress.
50 Republicans were in Congress.

Simple math shows WHY Democrats couldnt get much done.  Laws are not passed with a simple majority.  They are passed with a plurality vote.  Meaning, Democrats having 50 seats in Congress is irrelevant if they dont get 10 Republicans to vote on anything they want, which is not an easy thing to do.

Then on top of that, you had 2 Democrats in the Senate who obstructed the Democrats objectives.  Manchin and Sinema.
So again back to the simple math.
48 Democrats support a bill.
2 Democrats frequently dont support a bill
50 Republicans dont support a bill.

.....and yet you get ignorant people who ask, ""Why cant Democrats get things passed in Congress.""  The math shows why.  Especially when those same ignorant people choose to stay home the next election, or tell others ""whats the point of voting"", or ""you should go 3rd party.""

In short, things dont get done because many simply dont understand how the United States Government works.  Again using the Senate as an example of a common misconception, laws are not passed simply because a party holds a majority.  Laws are passed with a plurality vote, which like it or not, means Democrats dont have enough people in Congress to pass the things you want.  When you stay home, promote 3rd party.... this contributes to the very problem many are so ignorant about.  It also shows ignorance to party blocking the things you claim you want (if you lean left, progressive or liberal.)  As simple math shows Republicans are the ones blocking/obstructing the progress you want.  One has to literally look at the simple math of what party is obstructing things."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Republicans in Congress always vote against whatever the Democrats propose. The wealthiest campaign contributors control GOP members and punish them if they vote against their interests. Fifty years ago and longer, Democrats and Republicans worked together to get legislation passed."
OFi73TzEN_8,the not-so-subtly conservative verbage used in the title is very clever!
OFi73TzEN_8,"I disagree with some of what is said in this video.  First, the idea that Dems never get anything done is something I completely disagree with. Most people who say this believe that things are aren't getting gone in the way, at the speed, or too the degree of thier liking. Second, both parties have a mad habit of blaming the centrists and moderates for everything.  But again that goes back to the first one. Sometimes of the extremes of both sides can actually be self-destructive. They hinder themselves with the attitude of all or nothing or that the winner has to take all. If both sides have a scale of 1 to 10 in how Conservative or Progressive you are, and both sides convince you that anyone less than 8 is just as bad as anyone on the other side, of course citizens are confused and nothing gets done. They see someone on the Left who is a 6 as no better or worse than Trump or some on the Right. Some push an ""everyone but me is a centrist"" message. At some point the people on both ends start fighting about who is Left or Right enough. And if everyone is bad, shy should people care about voting at all? And often it's not Centrist causing problems,  it's people from the other side pretending to be on your side. For example,  there are a lot of guys I used to follow who claim to be part of the Pro-Black community, but I eventually got the impression they were undercover Trunpers or Conservatives. They used to same tactics as a platform like TYT. They would beat their chests about how they critisize both sides, but it became obvious to anyone paying attention they were clearly more critical of the Left. Both sides have become convinced that even the smallest amount of negotiation or compromise is basically surrender.  No matter how Left or Right you get , you need the other side and you still need moderates.  You need someone to balance you out..

Even if ai accept and give people the argument that Dems don't get anything done, moderates and Republicans aren't the reason. The problem is arrogance and a polls mindset.  What I mean by polls mindset is that Dems don't know how to just take a win. They want you to accept their position and they want to be right.  Republicans just want to win. They don't care about ""polls say Americans agree with us."" They just lie and say they do(though I'm not advocating for that). Polls are just how people feel at that time or what they agree with in theory. Just because I agree with something in a poll that doesn't mean it's a deal breaker come voting time. Republicans know when to stop fighting each other and just focus on winning. We have to stop voting on emotions and the thought of feeling good/exited about our vote. We have to vote like we're hiring someone to do a job. Something miraculous isn't going to happen every time we vote. We're not going to take 5 steps forward every election. Sometimes we have to focus just on not taking 5 steps back.. Sometimes you have to play to a stalemate. I've seen some platforms say in the same conversation that the Left pushed Biden way more than they ever excepted, then sound completely like Fox News. I don't see the logic there. It's not unlike when the Senate was 50/50. If 40 Dems voted the right way, we were more critical of them then the 10 and the 50 Republicans.

Also, at the end of the day, how can we complain about politicians not being serious when citizens.  There is no way Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, or Bernie Sanders should have to campaign with celebrities to motivate people to vote"

OFi73TzEN_8,"You have to be really dumb to not see that the Democrats are actually getting a lot done, but what they're getting done is the completion of the destruction of Western civilization."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The system is designed to be weak and inefficient.  The state governments should have more of a direct role in everyday life because they are closer to the people in their jurisdictions.

However, periodically the federal government is able to mobilize major legislation which expands its subject matter authority thus having a huge impact on everyday Americans.  In our especially divided period of politics, this tends make half of the population happy and the other half upset."
OFi73TzEN_8,The money in politics and lobbying is a formality. They’ll always be capitalist politicians no matter what. Capitalist democracy protects capitalism.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats are constantly in bed with big companies, which is funny because they say *Republicans* are the ones doing that."
OFi73TzEN_8,"1) Create problems
2) Blame Republicans 
3) Get reelected
4) Repeat"
OFi73TzEN_8,Fnckiung this! I e been making a nebulous argument along the same lines. Thanks for pinning this down.
OFi73TzEN_8,This guy's a soy boi
OFi73TzEN_8,Obama had a supermajority and Dems did the same thing. Democrats.
OFi73TzEN_8,Terrible video.
OFi73TzEN_8,They’re too busy touting their “moral superiority” and make empty promises in order to maintain their control over the populace
OFi73TzEN_8,Why get rid of gas and oil tho?
OFi73TzEN_8,The most biased title does not exi...
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats: ""WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GOVERN!""
Republicans: ""WE'RE JUST PLAIN EVIL!"""
OFi73TzEN_8,These low information comments are cringe.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Man, centrists are the most useless and no one bats an eye."
OFi73TzEN_8,I think the only thing they've done was run our economy to the ground😅
OFi73TzEN_8,Term limits and end the bribes.
OFi73TzEN_8,"You're so confident, and clearly have a huge ego to be so confident.

I, as a youtube commenter, will not sway your view. But after you live for a bit, you won't agree with your current dispositions"
OFi73TzEN_8,It's sad that people still fall for these promises and vote for democrats
OFi73TzEN_8,Tldr: vote trump 🇺🇸
OFi73TzEN_8,The democrats did get one thing done in this administration: the genocide of the Palestinian people.
OFi73TzEN_8,"it is fascinating to me that a democratic leader who doesn't vote 100% in favor of the party's goals is considered to be a villian. Washington famously refused to choose a party beleiving that the president should carefully consider both sides and then make a choice (however he did seem to favor hamilton's influence over Jefferesons'). This should be the gold standard for all senators and representatives. Do what you think is right even if it goes against the party's expilicit goals. 
I'm not trying to say that the republican party is any better, they also have a fair amount of mindless party followers. But I don't think I've ever heard anyone call them a villian for leaning to the left from time to time. 
There is corruption all throughout the government, I'm glad to see that there are still some people who are capable of calling out their own party before pointing their fingers across the aisle."
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrat efforts are illusionary. Robert f Kennedy jr  openly recognizes the corporate game and is against them. They fear him more than someone like Bernie Sanders because of this❤
OFi73TzEN_8,"Managed democracy in usa : ❌
Managed democracy on ps5 : ⬆️➡️⬇️⬇️⬇️"
OFi73TzEN_8,"What we have is a ruling party and another party that acts as the opposition.  Say what you want, but WA DC is 90% Democrat population.  No matter who gets elected, all the voters, media, interns, the janitors and the person who serves coffee at the local Starbucks is a Democrat."
OFi73TzEN_8,Fake democracy. USA is all about fake
OFi73TzEN_8,"thank you for posting this video. it reminded me to unsubb from your fake ass. Has nothing to do with this video, it just served as a reminder."
OFi73TzEN_8,"What you are describing is a fascist oligarchy not a democracy. We don’t live in a democracy. Monopoly, corporate interest, and rich elite control the government. And nationalist and the upholding of white supremacy hold terror over anyone wanting to make change."
OFi73TzEN_8,"i hope a lot of you are switching to Trump, Usurper of the GOP"
OFi73TzEN_8,Free America from AIPAC.... 🙄🤮
OFi73TzEN_8,What genre of man is this presenter?
OFi73TzEN_8,"corrupt government in general. that being said, id still vote ideals for blue than to go red qhere they are blatant about their corruption"
OFi73TzEN_8,How do we successfully get yellow and green parties on the ballot so dems and Republicans have to try alot harder to maintain this garbage
OFi73TzEN_8,"Yet George W Bush republicans and democrats really did nothing either besides initiated two wars(US-Afghan War and the Iraq War). Bush did nothing for the US recession after the 9/11 attacks or the 2008 Global Financial Ceisis or the 2007 US mortgage crisis/housing bubble. Bush did tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. Bush administration did nothing for hurricane Charlie Isabelle and Katrina. 2010(two thousand and ten or twenty ten. Two thousand and ten as there was no year zero in our calendar/thr Gregorian Calendar). Obama really did nothing as president with the border, he was against gay marriage, ststted a war in Libya with Ghidafi, did droid attscks, created cages near the border, and did over spending for the USA(Bush didn’t start the Grest Refession nor Obama ended it). Trump initiated two unconstitutional legislations Zero Tolerance and Country bans, he under minded the Covid-19 pandemic which killed nesrly 1.2M people, he shook hands with dictators, was impeached twice, did sexual abused women, he pur Syria in a weaker state, his American Fiest possibly lead to the 2021 Supply Chain crisis , and Zero Tolerance possibly lead to the border crisis. Biden has done nothing for abortion, he broke the first amendment with Covid vaccine mandates, his foreign policies have lead Afghanistan in shambles and done nkthjggn for Ukraine Russia or Isreal or Taiwan, he’S done nothing for SLF with student loans, cancelled the key stone pipeline, did nothing for the cost of living crisis, and has done nothing for the border crisis. All 4 21st century presidents sucked at being president(2001-24)."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Skill issue bro, too incompetent"
OFi73TzEN_8,"To those who don't want what they offer us

We are the revolutionist party."
OFi73TzEN_8,Vote 3rd party. Down with uniparty! Vote Jill Stein 2024! Only candidate not controlled by corporations/AIPAC
OFi73TzEN_8,Something we've all felt but could never really express. Well documented.
OFi73TzEN_8,"How is a barrier at the border xenophobic, how about you go to San Francisco and see all the people s******* themselves dying on the side of the road overdosing on fentanyl and let's not forget the black communities that are suffering in Chicago because all the immigrants are taking all the community social programs that were meant to help them."
OFi73TzEN_8,It’s because the democratic politicians know their policies would absolutely destroy the country but the ideas are popular enough amongst the large swaths of ignorant voters to get them elected.
OFi73TzEN_8,Dumbist post ever. Biden-Harris passed more significant legislation than any president since LBJ.
OFi73TzEN_8,Love the thumbnail!
OFi73TzEN_8,"My thoughts recently have been: if they make money from solving a problem, they’ll make sure it continues to be a problem."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats got everything done that they want to.  They want to give tax cuts to the rich, grow the military, they want a huge prison population.   They're remarkably effective,  they just won't admit what they really stand for."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Even tho I stand in complete and total opposition with everything you people believe in and want . As well as I do that with contempt .      
I still find it interesting you see your garbage party the same way large amounts of republican voters see the Republican party .. as it is the same way . There are always 1 or 2 that come out and ""prevent anything the R voters really want."
OFi73TzEN_8,Ah yes the two party system. We get to pick between fast fascism and slow fascism
OFi73TzEN_8,We have a Corporatocracy not a Democracy
OFi73TzEN_8,Biden ruined everybody's lives with Cackle-a's tie-breaking votes on over-spending.  Way too many hyphens and too much spending!
OFi73TzEN_8,Well thank the God he didn't deliver on those promises that would have FURTHER ruined the country.  Hasn't he done enough?
OFi73TzEN_8,I'm seriously concerned about the future of this country
OFi73TzEN_8,"How are Democrats going to keep running on issues of they solve the issues? The entire democratic political machine runs on human suffering. They keep people desperate, impoverished, and stupid so they can whip them into a frenzy during election year. They care about winning just enough to get lobbyists and then doing nothing else good."
OFi73TzEN_8,"ABC is a pro establishment, propaganda machine"
OFi73TzEN_8,Seems like this does not apply anymore in the current admin. Another way was figured out to control the people and to maintain their power.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Why do people keep saying the Democrats don’t accomplish anything when they’re pretty successfully trashing the country? The destructiveness of their policies is a feature, not a bug."
OFi73TzEN_8,Where is Joe?
OFi73TzEN_8,"As a conservative idk why YouTube recommended me this video, but it sure was interesting. Glad to see the Democrat’s platitudes aren’t only recognized by my side even if we don’t agree on the outcome."
OFi73TzEN_8,Red are crooks
OFi73TzEN_8,democracy was mistake
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is the biggest dilemma in the world...why doesnt Politician just get the jobs done? Why dont they do their as they promised? They do 5percent of what they promised and lies about it,gaslights and lies again to the public that he needed more time to get the job done so if we vote for him this time things are gonna change, and we believe him again 😂😂😂yes i know that its not as easy to get the real issues solved but that is why we vote, we vote for a person we think will be best suited to solving the problems so that he will have the power needed to solve it with their support ofc....

Biden did a lot of things wrong this time, especially sending that much money to Ukraine and worse of all is lying and gaslighting us about the inflation lying to our face that the economy is great when we can hardly afford Food rations,rent,gas, just barely and forget about going on vacations even with 2 jobs😢😢😢😢 somethint really bad is happening when you can't buy anything else than neccesities like food,Gas,Rent and then its over even with two three jobs....are they encourage us to start cooking meth like walter white?"
OFi73TzEN_8,Y'all still gonna vote for them. Lie to your face and say more please. Only way to send them the message is to not show up to the polls. When you vote for disappointment you get what you vote for.
OFi73TzEN_8,And this is why they hate Trump. He’s not a politician. He doesn’t want to play their game. That’s why they have tried to destroy his life.
OFi73TzEN_8,"“The democrats the party of the working class.” 
lol what a joke"
OFi73TzEN_8,"The ""border bill"" has as much to do with the border as the ""inflation reduction act' had anything to do with reducing inflation. For those who don't know, it had nothing to do with reducing inflation, it created more inflation. They give it a fancy name because they know that there are a lot of stupid people out there that will just read the headlines and will still vote for them."
OFi73TzEN_8,They're liars with hidden agendas that's why they never accomplish whatever they set out to do because their stated policy was never their actual goal.
OFi73TzEN_8,You all are a bunch of snowflakes.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Read the book ""Winner Take All Politics"" and youll understand why politicians intentionally never get anything done."
OFi73TzEN_8,Because they're lying socialists. *Like you.*
OFi73TzEN_8,Vote for Rojas 2024 “Let’s put back United in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA”
OFi73TzEN_8,"Nobody ever gets anything done anymore because of the America voters, make no mistake. One party is totally represented by obstructionists, and the other is always represented by more corporate Democrats than they are by progressive Democrats who actually want to get some of these big proposals done. There’s always just enough no votes in the end to kill the proposal, because THE AMERICAN VOTER supports corporate candidates in Congressional primary elections. Always. Reliably. That’s why Joe Manchin still has a job. It’s why Joe Donnelly still has a job. It’s why lobbyists still have a job. America is so divided that nobody ever has a majority large enough to pass anything meaningful."
OFi73TzEN_8,Politicians see us as a number and laugh at us behind closed doors. They only care about their pocket which means keeping the 1% happy.
OFi73TzEN_8,Great stuff
OFi73TzEN_8,If they ban lobbyists their wouldn't be anymore politicians they only get into politics for the bribes  not because of American people
OFi73TzEN_8,"Hey, I understand that Democrats don't really do much, but I wanted to take this moment to make sure to remind everyone to VOTE. Because one side is actively hostile to democracy and does nothing but win if you don't vote. Yeah, it's stalling for time, but we need time to organize."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The democrats did do a lot during this term, though. Look at those food and gas prices! Look at the state of the southern border! It takes effort to destroy something so thoroughly."
OFi73TzEN_8,If only the people who voted Democrat policies stayed intheir states instead of coming to places like Florida. Then maybe they would vote in better politicians instead of bringing their policies to different states.
OFi73TzEN_8,Please discuss the American Communist Party.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Infrastructure project got done. You know, the one TFG promised ""in two weeks"" for 4 years and the Repugs voted against when Biden and the Dems proposed one and which the Repugs then took credit for on the home district stump.  Soinds like the Border reform the Repugs killrd because TFG told them to after they agreed to it. The list hoes on. I do agree the Dems have a lot more to do, so Vote Blue."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Democrat Party is broken. Or better yet it stopped hiding it’s intentions. After the past four years, how could anyone vote for them again? Countless lies and open corruption but useful idiots will still support them and die on the hill defending them."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Excuse me, what do the Republicans get done? 😂"
OFi73TzEN_8,Never get anything done? Biden has passed more significant legislation of any president since LBJ. Infrastructure and reduced drug prices are just two examples. The problem is that when a lie is told often enough people will believe it.
OFi73TzEN_8,"The democrats need to reform and become like the Minnesota branch and have direct union with involvement, force all members to bind on voting and stand up to represent Working People. They need to model themselves off UK Labour or the Australian Labor Party if they have any chance of meaningful reform to enact actual change"
OFi73TzEN_8,Because they are too busy getting rich
OFi73TzEN_8,Good video.
OFi73TzEN_8,Good video
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats are corrupt  always working on problems but they never solved one
OFi73TzEN_8,Thank you for all you do!
OFi73TzEN_8,Wait a minute.. I saw this episode of South Park!
OFi73TzEN_8,Oh Democrats get plenty done. Have you seen the country lately? 🤔
OFi73TzEN_8,"Let's be fair, it's not like the Democrats, especially from 2021 to present haven't done anything. They destroyed American energy independence, spent, spent and spent, caused record inflation, The Afghanistan debacle, held political prisoners, weaponized the justice system against their political opponent, subverted democracy many, many times, have allowed 10 million illegal immigrants to stroll into our country, they currently have a Weekend at Bernie's Presidency, defied courts, tried to mandate vaccines (man, who are the real fascists again?) Just to name a few. They're have been two major wars on their watch which they do little about except spend our money to pay their buddies. So no, the Democrats have a got a lot done. It's just that it's a lot of bad things"
OFi73TzEN_8,Need to ban lobbying
OFi73TzEN_8,Remember when Republicans blocked the border bill?
OFi73TzEN_8,Vote Jill Stein
OFi73TzEN_8,"Lol the Democrats do not represent the priorities of the poor or the working class! They are the party of the elite. Also, Republicans also have these types of politicians. The Senator from Maine, McConnell, Graham, former Ohio Senator Rob Portman, the idiots in congress that voted against Jim Jordan for speaker, etc."
OFi73TzEN_8,this dude is a moron lol
OFi73TzEN_8,"The reality is that regardless of what party you claim to be from; democrat, republican, green, etc they all have no need or consideration of getting stuff done, all they too is bullshit and pander to sheeple voters. They only care about getting elected just to make people feel like they are doing something"
OFi73TzEN_8,Biden also promised more funding into cancer research and treatment and then it was reported by the New York Post that that funding just went into salaries to his buddies
OFi73TzEN_8,"The thing the video misses out is that who is a centrist shifts with the Overton window. The centrist elected by the democrats today would be considered the most extreme of radicals if you go back far enough like the 1800’s, but even judging by 1900’s standards especially on social issues they would be considered too radical by most socialist countries."
OFi73TzEN_8,Solutions… does anyone know of solutions?
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats and Republicans are useless to the American people,    We The People need real change. Declare your independence from corporate America and useless government 😤🐐🫶🏼🇺🇸🦅"
OFi73TzEN_8,"As a conservative/libertarian, this video was not what I was expecting, but still opened my eyes to just how bad the ""two party"" system is. (And I already thought it was bad before)

I may not agree with this channel's demographic on HOW to make a better America, I agree that the corporate run america has got to stop because noone is winning under the current system.

Fantastic video"
OFi73TzEN_8,"You have a choice!!! You can choose jerkoff/sellout A or jerkoff/sellout B. Or there is always a third vote option, you can vote ""no confidence"" by not casting a vote, it's still a vote, just one that doesn't give the jerkoff/sellouts power."
OFi73TzEN_8,WTF are you talking about? You are so WRONG.  I really liked y😊until this s.  Bye Bye to this channel for BULLSHIT.
OFi73TzEN_8,I just wanna mention that I would rather have nothing happen than the current Republican Party being in office because their agenda is literally anti human rights and I'm not OK with that
OFi73TzEN_8,Because they just want your money 💰.  They don't want to help you.
OFi73TzEN_8,"The problem with todays politicians is that they think getting a seat is the end goal. They forget that once they have a majority, there’s supposed to do something. No other job would allow such blatant incompetence, we should fire the government 🤷🏾‍♂️"
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats are geniuses when it comes to job security. Their job security. Can't fix it if you need to campaign on it next election.
OFi73TzEN_8,Must be hard when black rock owns everything
OFi73TzEN_8,It’s funny how the Democratic Party can never unify the moderate and progressive voters. Each group always end up settling for one or the other by default
OFi73TzEN_8,So somehow both sides are right?
OFi73TzEN_8,"The republicans are efficient at making themselves rich, the democrats are incompitent at helping the less fortunate."
OFi73TzEN_8,"""Radical change"" is something everyone wants in their heads, but doesn't want to actually happen and potentially impact them, the status quo will always have an advantage because it's more comfortable."
OFi73TzEN_8,Let's keep voting for them!
OFi73TzEN_8,"So... pretty much the democrats say they'll do these things to better the citizens of the country just to get the important seat in the house and then fo nothing they promised to keep the organization that feed them happy?

Basically keeping everything the same but also gradually making things worse when a huge change happens and nothing is done about it like Roe v Wade?"
OFi73TzEN_8,Can't get anything done except get that third mansion built.
OFi73TzEN_8,1:22 Trump did though. Even with split Republicans at first that didn't like him
OFi73TzEN_8,Let’s not forget president Biden promised to federally legalize marijuana within the first 100 days of presidency and promised to expunge non violent marijuana offenders records. Yeah that didn’t happen
OFi73TzEN_8,"Thank you, comrades, for your outstanding work ❤"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Bc they don't have to do anything but fill their bank accounts.  Dem voters r over educated and uninformed by design.  The dem base will vote for them no matter what bc the other choice is the ""enemy"""
OFi73TzEN_8,Incompetency? They put people in positions for skin color and gender rather than qualifications? They are okay with a senile man being the “most powerful man in the free world”. They don’t care about Americans? (Both parties don’t) shall I go on?
OFi73TzEN_8,It's not just Democrats.  The Unparty belongs to the highest bidder.
OFi73TzEN_8,It was never right vs left. It’s about the minority keeping power above the majority.
OFi73TzEN_8,"What I really just can't wrap my head around with american progressives rn is their opinion towards Palestine. I understand that the leadership of Israel currently is far from ideal, to put it mildly, however the leadership of Palestine is about as far from progressive as humanly possible: they're radical islamic terrists, they're openly sexist and homophobic, and openly want to promote aggressive islamic militant action. I understand the desire for a peaceful resolution, but I don't understand the blatantly ignorant belief that's possible with Hamas so deeply rooted in Palestine...."
OFi73TzEN_8,Replace the D word for the R word and you’ll have a correct title
OFi73TzEN_8,"If they fixed any of the issues they ran on, they wouldn’t have that carrot to dangle over the peon’s heads at the next election. “This time we’re going to do it!”"
OFi73TzEN_8,"This smug video is absurd.  Yes, ""there's always some Democrat who comes out of the woodwork"" - in RED states.  Like Manchin in DEEP RED West Virginia, or Sinema in purple Arizona, who sold out to Republican donors.  It's not about ""Democrats"", it's about our sorry excuse for a nation where millions tune into Fox every night for their brainwashing.  

Please do even a minimal amount of familiarization with state-level politics before you put out another one of these crap videos."
OFi73TzEN_8,''They just need to look like they're progressive'' I don't think there's a better way to define the modern Democrat party than with this sentence
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Left gets votes by fearmongering. Every time they solve a problem, they lose leverage over part of their voter base."
OFi73TzEN_8,"""Managed democracy"" = C-O-R-R-U-P-T-I-O-N!!!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"15:26  
⬇️⬅️⬇️⬆️➡️"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Oh yeah a 15 dollar minimum wage. 

Just the thing to bring us closer to Chavezes and Maduro's Socialist paradise."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The ironic thing about Obamacare is that instead of reducing the cost of private health insurance, it more than doubled it.  Also, since it is taxpayer funded, that means everyone has it and it’s impossible to opt out of.  This means that anyone who has private health insurance is actually paying for 2 forms of health insurance.  Nit very fair is it.  Also, the government passed a law that makes it illegal for any private insurer to offer more coverage than the government and charge cheaper rates than the government.  This basically removes all competition and allows existing private insurers to charge higher rates all the time without offering more benefits.  These are the same insurance companies that have for decades been funding the political campaigns of Democrats who also hold a large amount of stock in these companies.  Essentially, government involvement makes things more expensive and oppressive, not the other way around."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Well, not sure if the alternative (Republicans and Trump) are any good either. If anything, they want to get rid of the whole electoral system itself. 😅"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Well, I'm pretty proud of the list of legislation that President Biden and his team have put together over his term in office.  In fact, it is the most extensive list of legislation that any president in our country's history has ACCOMPLISHED!  So, quit projecting, get real, enjoy life, and VOTE BLUE!🔵"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Oh they got plenty done.  Obamacare, nationalizing of tons of land, the opening of the border."
OFi73TzEN_8,They'll say whatever to get in to office
OFi73TzEN_8,Perfectly done
OFi73TzEN_8,FJB FKH🤬
OFi73TzEN_8,I find peace of mind sometimes in knowing that all will pass.
OFi73TzEN_8,"this is an incredible, comprehensive video. thank you for putting it in such an easily-understandable way"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Very well laid out. When power and money meet, you gotta love it"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Glad you referred to Sheldon Wolin, his book democracy inc. and theory of ""inverted totalitarianism"" is great and had a great contribution on my radicalization into socialism"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Republicans do the same thing. It’s why our dreams of “draining the swamp” still live on. After Trump’s VP pick though, I’m beginning to think it’ll remain a dream until we ALL decide we’ve had enough."
OFi73TzEN_8,Most democrat voters just nod and follow/repeat whatever the media tells them.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Everything they do is to make you dependent I have a friend who works for DCHS and the amount of people calling for government assestiance and have no real intention of working is crazy. The Democrats want easy people to control thats why they dont like the idea of men and women getting along and having children, thats why they like to push LGBTQ in TV,movies, and they make narrative like LGBTQ genocide."
OFi73TzEN_8,"What is scary about this well made video (and the situation as a whole) is that right wingers actually believe the ""left"" controls the media, the education system, the culture, etc.  And  it's the opposite,  all of the power resides with the 1% and they will not allow any meaningful change"
OFi73TzEN_8,This is one of the best youtube videos i have ever heard.
OFi73TzEN_8,The same things can be said with the Republican party and their flip-floppers.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Both Republicans and Democrats are anti American, sexist and anti black. Same party split in two."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Man it's great to see that somebody gets this. My favorite example (which is essentially 100% proof of this deliberate zero-sum game) is some years back Bernie had a bill to lower prescription drug costs by allowing repatriation of the US-made drugs from Canada. This kind of bill has been on the Democratic platform for years. In classic Bernie fashion, he somehow miraculously got 12 Republican senators to support it, meaning it would pass easily in a 50/50 Senate. Lo and behold, the day after it became known that 12 Republicans planned to vote for the bill, exactly 13 Democratic senators led by Cory Booker suddenly opposed it based on the the typical conservative nonsense about consumer safety etc, and it died with VP Pence being the tie-breaking vote.
It's so obviously deliberate with the revolving bad-guy as you put it, in this case they needed to whip up 13 bad guys. Yet mainstream liberals think it's a crazy conspiracy theory to believe that. I'm fed up with Democrats to the point that if there were a sane Republican at the top of the ballot this November I would vote for a Republican for the first time in my life. I can't in good conscience do that given who will be on there, but at the same time we need something that might get people to see reality as it is."
OFi73TzEN_8,Its simple if problems are solved then they cant sit around talikng and campaining about the problems
OFi73TzEN_8,You're so full of shit.
OFi73TzEN_8,Im from CT and disgusted our senator was the reason we dont have a public option today. Unfortunately insurance is big business here. Thanks a lot Liberman. 😑

OFi73TzEN_8,I don't see how anybody can be against the border wall
OFi73TzEN_8,A detailed video about BDS boycott divest sanctioning would be helpful for people to know what they can do.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Surely, you must know something Biden has done……….like the Infrastructure Bill. All I know for certain is Democratic presidents inherit economic dumpster fires. The Democratic president cleans up the economy, gives it to the Republican president, and get handed back another economic dumpster fire. Trump increased the national debt……..more than any other president. There are more jobs and the country is safer now than it was under Trump. So, you’re concentrating on democrats, but you haven’t laid out republicans do the same thing. Anywho, Trump has never won an election through the popular vote. He’s not about to start now."
OFi73TzEN_8,There’s a black rock ad on this video 😭😭😭
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because republicans

Didnt need to watch the video to know this is exactly what you would say."
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats want to fail so that they can run again on the same platform.
OFi73TzEN_8,"What? Both sides are corrupt? Nooooo, that could never happen. (Sarcasm)"
OFi73TzEN_8,"In fairness, neither do Republicans and I am voting for Trump in November."
OFi73TzEN_8,"So... Republicans are the Harlem Globetrotters, and the Democrats are the Washington Generals - paid to lose. 😅"

DEMs are the amateurs, brash, unhinged, unlimited. Unskilled and have zero competence even in the field of lying. Thus, they either don't care or don't have any ability to deliver anything. They simply rely on the loyalty of their dumb customers who, in most aspects, are exactly like them."
OFi73TzEN_8,"If you understand pro wrestling, you understand politics. It literally works in exactly the same way. There’s all these stables and factions fulfilling storylines featuring good guys and villains. A news cycle that makes you love somebody but even more importantly, HATE somebody. And even though you know it’s all a show, you never know for sure what parts are planned and when they’re just shooting from the hip. It’s all designed for you to feel and think as little as possible."
OFi73TzEN_8,what else do you commies intend to do america is finished
OFi73TzEN_8,Because we are not a Democracy. Both parties serve the same Corporate Interests.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because they say all kinds of shit, and do anything in their power to satisfy their ulterior motives"
OFi73TzEN_8,"I didn’t watch the video
And I’m not going to because the title
Is a lie. 

People’s student loans have been paid off—Dems did that

Roads have been rebuilt—Dems did that

Anti-chokehold legislation—-Dems did that

Broadband in underserved communities—Dems did that

Hostages home from Russia—Dems did that"
OFi73TzEN_8,This is ridiculous.  Democrats just passed the biggest boost in history to renewables and EV adoption.  EXACTLY what is needed to pave the way for moving OFF fossil fuels entirely.  You can't just switch off FFs overnight without the infrastructure to replace it.  Democrats are building that.  Stop whining and empower them to do more.
OFi73TzEN_8,It's interesting every country has it's own kind of this system preventing any fundemental change under the guise of a democratic parliament
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats are just incognito capitalists who sometimes engage in performative grandstanding on social issues.
OFi73TzEN_8,Because the Republicans exist 😅
OFi73TzEN_8,You are Sharp Sir great video but we the people need to do something lets start our own party because the remaining 2 are somewhat corrupt 🗣️
OFi73TzEN_8,They ride every year out getting richer n richer self serving for themselves.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Now thats funny to say.  Lets go Harris. Take the weak orange thug down. Keep putting things for the people as you have. Currently have the lowest monthly imagination  crossings since 2017. Pushes for better maturlall health for people of color. New airline rules to get flights refunded quickly and have clear documentation to these flight fees, wiping out college loan debt for Americans, lowering the costs to diabetes medication, getting to the lowest unemployment in this country's history, economy growing at an average 2.8% which is higher that before and after trump was in office, mental health advocacy funding for mental health initiatives, fighting against trump appointed texas judge pittman who blocked placing an $8 maximum to credit card late fees instead of paying out in the 30's, economic empower plan to help ethic businesses, strengthening the funding to the pell grant system back to proper levels to aid students across this country to get a higher education. All has happened under Biden and Harris, all has helped Americans in this country."
OFi73TzEN_8,"They keep saying that the Republicans are the party of the rich. Yet,  most (if not all) millioners  and billioners tell you to vote Democrat. Ever wonder why?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"I understand the video, but it doesn't seem surprising.  Democratic political power is always in conflict with concentrated economic capital.  Capital doesn't necessarily need or want government that works for them.  They already have power.  They just need it not to work against them."
OFi73TzEN_8,"I'll answer in 1 seconds: Climate Change, Racism, Republicans"
OFi73TzEN_8,"This video was horribly timed. Why would somebody post this during the election? We need the democrats to win and stop trump, criticise them after they're elected"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats are the people who want the job but not the work. Republicans claim they want to eliminate they government but somehow make it bigger.

They"
OFi73TzEN_8,This is great video. Can you also do a deep dive into Republicans?
OFi73TzEN_8,"It's really quite simple:  If we kept our promises, we'd have nothing to promise you the next time we want your vote (and your money)."
OFi73TzEN_8,Because they are corrupt and hate the people who they say they support which is why so many former democrats support Trump
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because if they solved the problem, no one would ever have a reason to vote for them. The truth is that at the founding of the us public funds were not to be used for social programs. Churches and local communities were supposed to take care of the poor not the federal government."
OFi73TzEN_8,"I lol'd at this video.
You hilariously describe any democrat who acknowledges that fossil fuels are needed to keep the country running as a ""conservative democrat"""
OFi73TzEN_8,There is no such thing as a good progressive bill
OFi73TzEN_8,When the purpose of the party is to do the bidding of their lobbyist master of course they will do nothing for the country.
OFi73TzEN_8,Literally playing both sides of the fence
OFi73TzEN_8,15:35 Why I suddenly heard a music?
OFi73TzEN_8,Its likely they are elected in red districts and looking to keep their jobs.
OFi73TzEN_8,no matter who wins in November WE ALL LOOSE all of Washington is nothing but corrupt millionaires enriching themselves and their billionaire donors with our tax dollars
OFi73TzEN_8,If the US passed every progressive bill we'd be North Mexico and East China by now
OFi73TzEN_8,This is no true. They do in fact get a lot done. Like resulting in the deaths of over 1.26 million Americans from 2020-2024.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Villain seat of student loan forgiveness? Yes, let’s make all the people who didn’t go to college and get paid less because of it, pay for elites to go to college and get richer. Naw sounds like a hero"
OFi73TzEN_8,Money
OFi73TzEN_8,Lobbying is bribery and should be illegal
OFi73TzEN_8,Sinema is independent just saying
OFi73TzEN_8,Well I will admit that is the best explanation of same 💩 different pile I've come across.
OFi73TzEN_8,Don’t u mean the government as whole never gets anything done ???? Name something helpful a republican has done to help ur life ???? Minimum wage has been 7.25 for the past 16 years dude please stop trolling
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is exactly how, and why they sabotaged Bernie and forced Hillary on the 2016 ticket even though they knew Bernie could beat trump but Hillary couldn't."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Ah yes because pushing the agenda in every facet of society through connections is ""nothing"""
OFi73TzEN_8,"If problems get solved, what else will Democrats (on any politician for that matter) fearmonger off of in order for you to give them power by voting for them?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"They do get things done, and if people would stop listening to the corrupt, right wing propoganda machine, they know that"
OFi73TzEN_8,"I don't think it's quite accurate to say that Biden didnt get *anything* done, though I do think the rotating villian argument makes sense. Still, at the end of the day Biden is a politician and it's kind of hard to see what he'd have to gain electorally by making sure that his agenda didn't get enacted. And let's face it, this is gonna be his last gig, it's not like he didn't care if he lost the election 'cause he could just go work as a lobbyist. To me this argument seems more applicable to an Obama or a Clinton (either of them)."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Your critique of the Biden administration is so one sided. You don't speak to any of the legislative wins from infrastructure and gun control to the first actual climate legislation in a generation, capped costs for inhalers, and aggressive FTC have been incredible achievements that most administrations never did. For most of the bills you listed, you would need 60 Senators to pass the legislation and last time I checked we didn't have that many, so negotiation with GOP will always water down a progressive bill. You don't seem to understand that there are 3 branches of government and you confuse the executive branch as more powerful than it is and you completely ignore the role the courts play in slowing down or changing legislation. You also fail to mention that the Alaskan representative's district uses ranked choice voting, which is not the case for the WA rep (it's a purple district that was previously held by a GOP rep).

The GOP are obstructionists. The GOP is extreme. Sure there are problems with Democrats, but it's the only party that actually gets anything done.

This video was a biased joke."
OFi73TzEN_8,He is talking like a communist.
OFi73TzEN_8,The difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican one is almost gone.
OFi73TzEN_8,https://youtu.be/1kIWW2JFU0w?si=5PSapcY5fbMvDNnw
OFi73TzEN_8,"This was SO MASTERFUL..MASTERFUL MASTERFUL!! This needs to go VIRAL ON TWITTER, TIK TOK, RUMBLE, ETC!! The American people are NOT EDUCATED ON THE TRUTH. Majority site sources like MSDNC, CNN, FOX, ABC, TYT, Sam Seder, etc"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Obamacare, DACA, build back better, Chips Act…just to name a few pieces of legislation. never get anything done lol sure man."
OFi73TzEN_8,They get a lot done but it's never to help the American people only to help themselves
OFi73TzEN_8,"Glad to be in Canada. While lobbying is a problem over here as well, we have systems that ban corporations from donating to parties and severely limiting donations from individuals. This ensures that our (imperfect) PM can make ""radical"" changes like introducing Carbon tax, banning employing temporary workers when unions go on strike, raise the inclusion rate for capital gains tax for corporations and introduce limited government sponsored dental and pharmaceutical insurance. Our ""centrist"" party is more left-leaning than the ""Leftist"" party in the US. We have our own problems like fossil fuel corporations being given subsidies inspite of their impact on climate change, and not enough being done for aboriginal people beyond the rhetoric and a holiday. But I admire that actions against corporations can taken over here without fear of bankrupting the party."
OFi73TzEN_8,"I've often likened US politics to the WWE. There are professional performers doing stunts pretending to oppose each other, and one -fan- consituent's hero is another's heel, but when the show goes off-air for the day, the performers can still be ""friends,"" because they're all getting paid by the same company."
OFi73TzEN_8,Lobbying is basically legalized corruption. Thats it!
OFi73TzEN_8,Liberalism sucks!
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats take money. Republicans make money 

Thats the difference , we have welfar and we have work"
OFi73TzEN_8,16:19 boom 💥
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is an outstanding insight into the U.S. political system - like the big reveal at the end of a political horror-thriller, or the ending of “Murder on the orient express” when you find out that everyone is in it together in the criminal enterprise. U.S. democracy is a total sham."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Your argument is based on the idea that Biden and democrats get nothing done. Except that's not true. Infrastructure, anti lynching, 52 billion dollars for R@D, VA coverage for toxic burn pits as well  as 31 new VA centers, PUMP act and so on. Does none of these mean anything to you just because we didn't get literal socialism? As for your follow ups, i feel like everything in this video is obvious. Our system works through corporations and donors. This is nothing new."
OFi73TzEN_8,Ok. What do we do now?
OFi73TzEN_8,"That's why the Democrats are more than happy to allow the GOP to play the Trump card, pun intended. They think that Trump is a good motivator to allow for more Democratic power. Therefore, ANY Democrat can head up the ticket and they're supposed to win...EXCEPT it didn't work in 2016! Oops."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The “do-nothing” Dems are always just offering vapid rhetoric to the Progressive Left.  They have no intention of actually delivering on anything but just try to use scare tactics to motivate us to vote by fear mongering (“Orange Man bad”, etc.)"
OFi73TzEN_8,The premise of this video is very misleading. They’ve got some things done.
OFi73TzEN_8,So when does the revolution start?
OFi73TzEN_8,I’m pissed !
OFi73TzEN_8,I’m forever an anti trumper!
OFi73TzEN_8,Can't wait for the two party farce to fall. Both parties absolutely disgust me!
OFi73TzEN_8,I think it is hilarious that your videos are the only ones where I'm so happy there are ads.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Progressive bills don't pass because our society is a voluntary society. And commies aren't liberal, they're commies.... big difference."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Y'all whine and complain like people who take the easy way out and say all politicians suck and don't vote.
""Don't boo. Vote!""

Progress is hard and if you weren't alive in the 60's, read some history.
Quit complaining, get off the couch, get involved, and vote!"
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats use the media to get people to hate/fear the opposing party so much that they can do anything they want knowing that their voter base is stuck to them like glue.
OFi73TzEN_8,"What about the trillion dollar infrastructure bill, chips bill, inflation reduction act, sending troops home from Afghanistan."
OFi73TzEN_8,I'm center-center right. I like this video.
OFi73TzEN_8,Thanks!
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because it’s a bunch of boomers who are content sitting on their money that the system they created made them. Republicans are the same, except guns."
OFi73TzEN_8,Everyone’s fed up with them
OFi73TzEN_8,Always sabotaging their best candidates like Bernie and RFK Jr.
OFi73TzEN_8,We desperately need a third party. Both democrats and Republicans are two sides of the same coin.
OFi73TzEN_8,How is lobbying not bribery and is legal in US is blowing my mind every single time I think about it.
OFi73TzEN_8,Lobbying should be illegal
OFi73TzEN_8,"In 2021 they really didn't have the Senate.
We were lucky to get what we did."
OFi73TzEN_8,L đem L rep L America 😂
OFi73TzEN_8,10:10 Stealing money from the working class🤔 is like stealing money from the nation's future; doesn't matter what country🇨🇦 or🇺🇸 it is!😔 I don't like the feeling I am getting right now😬... There should be a cap on the age (65) of the person who can become the President of America🇺🇸 just like no one younger than 35 years old can't be trusted with the highest office🏛 in the country📣... On a personal note I love my #creditunion!🏛 They also hurting manage to survive the last financial crisis🤔... #MeridianCU great for financial funding... #StrongerTogether🌎💘💰
OFi73TzEN_8,Politicians are parasites who maintain the status quo….
OFi73TzEN_8,all they do is spend your tax dollars in crappy silly programs to launder money
OFi73TzEN_8,"The democrats are literally willing to throw an election and posture as the ""opposition party"" to another Trump presidency instead of platforming completely reasonable social democratic changes (IE free college and M4A). They would rather have a rightwing populist than a leftwing one. What more proof do you need that they're just another rightwing party. Nuff said and fuck the democrats. At least the GOP is mask off about how soulless and evil they are."
OFi73TzEN_8,Guys! You don't understand! IT'S THE SENATE PARLIAMENTARIAN!
OFi73TzEN_8,I believe we have a chance with RFK as he states out right the issues with corporate America and how he intends to solve these issues.
OFi73TzEN_8,Capitalism is the best economic system ever
OFi73TzEN_8,Too busy organizing a koo against one of their own.
OFi73TzEN_8,Vote for Kennedy
OFi73TzEN_8,I got a trump ad on this 💀💀
OFi73TzEN_8,Politicians want to get elected. They dont care about solving problems. They just want to stay in office. Thats how you end up with politicians literally working in govt until they die or retire and have accomplished little to nothing.
OFi73TzEN_8,Letter of Birmingham and what Malcolm X has said about the government pretty much sums up Dems.
OFi73TzEN_8,I got an add of game called “adventure communist” depicting communism as something stupid and funny while watching this video. Genuinely scary
OFi73TzEN_8,Ten minutes in and already 3 commercials......UGH.MAKE IT STOP.
OFi73TzEN_8,Lool gop oppose everything
OFi73TzEN_8,It seems certain groups have infiltrated American politics to insure that both parties fail the country and its citizens for the benefit of a small secretive or not so secretive group of embezzlers. Or am I turning into a conspiracy theorist?
OFi73TzEN_8,The US is as much a democracy as Russia is
OFi73TzEN_8,This is insane !   None of this is true !!! And at the least the Republicans will never vote for stuff that's good for the people . Why is this guy saying things that it is they who are the ones doing this shit 🤔 🤬
OFi73TzEN_8,Politics has never been an option for good. It is always a selection between bad and worst.
OFi73TzEN_8,But Trump is better ? The man that said he would date his own daughter
OFi73TzEN_8,Nailed
OFi73TzEN_8,Sheldon Wolen should be mandatory reading
OFi73TzEN_8,"The premise of this video is fine, but it’s incredibly lazy and dumb to dismiss the inflation reduction act, bipartisan infrastructure law, and CHIPS and Science Act. IRA is literally the largest investment in decarbonization in human history and it’s just dismissed because of some drilling permits that will have a negligible impact on annual emissions."
OFi73TzEN_8,There is senate filibuster
OFi73TzEN_8,DEMOCRATS PASSED RECORD AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION 2020-2022
OFi73TzEN_8,Get organized 🥰
OFi73TzEN_8,"Just becuz Sleepy Hoe dropped out doesnt change anything in this video. 

If Kamala gets elected the new narrative will be that she was blocked in congress for being a black woman."
OFi73TzEN_8,A  West Virginia democrat  Joe Manchin and Arizona democrat senator Kristen Sinema voting with the Republican party  was the reason Joe Biden could not keep his promise. Not sure what you're talking about. Truth + Wisdom = Peace ✌🙏🙌👏.
OFi73TzEN_8,"I agree with most of what you say here, and great analysis of the mechanism. I also agree with the conclusion. But I think the framing of ""never get anything done"" is false. There are significant things that get done, and they make a real difference in people's lives. For example, with Biden, the covid vaccination campaign, the appointment of Justice Brown Jackson, anti-discrimination protections for trans folks, student debt relief (yes, not as much as we wanted, but what we got was targeted to the poorest folks), marijuana schedule review, progress on climate change. Yes, compared to what we need a lot of this is unimpressive. But it's a huge difference compared to the direction of GOP administrations who not only would have not done this stuff, they would have made much of it worse."
OFi73TzEN_8,Why did I just get an ad in the middle of this video for Black Rock?? 😂😂😂
OFi73TzEN_8,"All of these things are true about the Republican party too, but way worse. Also this video is terribly fact checked. Biden got as much climate policy passed as he could."
OFi73TzEN_8,This doesn’t sound like a “democrat” problem this sounds like a systematic one
OFi73TzEN_8,The people are so god damned fed up with this bullshit!!
OFi73TzEN_8,Love the content
OFi73TzEN_8,"While Americans (at least the mainstream media) like to cheer about its ""democracy"", the democratic system of the US has been flawed probably from the beginning. For starters, there's no ""labor party"", and both parties represent interests of big corporations and the wealthy, just different kinds. Note that while no parties are perfect, there are indeed labor parties in other democratic countries, such as the UK and France. The bipartisan setup made sure there's never gonna be a popular third party that can have the chance of winning an election, meaning that it's simply not possible for any major party to truly represent the poor and middle class. It's a sad truth that no one talks about it on the media -- oh, and there's no ""public media"" (consistent funding from the federal or central government that stays neutral no matter which party takes the office) in the US, so all media, including the so-called NPR, ultimately would take money from owners and donors, representing their interest. This is pure sadness."
OFi73TzEN_8,"I love the Trump commercials I get when I’m watching your channel, lol."
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is why things don’t get done in politics in general. There are way too many examples of lobbying politicians. Whether it’s money, leverage, governance, etc. people will scramble for that power. And we need to somehow become united again. But a lot of us focus more on outside influence and opinions, instead of trying to build our communities. And that weakens us at our very foundation. How can we win political battles when we don’t even stand together in our communities."
OFi73TzEN_8,The problem is the GOP
OFi73TzEN_8,"really good video, pretty eye opening, thank you for making it!"
OFi73TzEN_8,Cooperations and the rich rule the USA. Doesn’t matter it it’s left or right.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Biden in his first term cancelled billons of student loans 

Also lgbtq+ vets that were dishonorably discharged for sexual orientation he reversed 

Ended 20 yr afghan war longest in history for americans and the sloppy break contact was because trumps shitty deal he couldnt fulfill and biden had to 

Passes the largest infrastructure bill in history 

52yr low unemployment in Just his first term as president..... 


2.7 average raises across the board for federal employees 

Ban goods made by Uyghur slave labor 

Distribute 1.5 billion to strengthen school meal program 

His first yr he created 8 billion jobs..... thats a record 

Unemployment was 6.2 when biden took office and dropped to 3.9 this is first term mind you 

Expanded ACA coverage  millions now have access and its only growing 

His cabinet, first ever cabinet in history is non white, and includes woman of color, lgbtq, and other ethinic backgrounds

Also dumped major funding in offshore wind turbines, im sure youve seen AOC going to some of the project sites. 

Theres much more i could post as that was just 1 yr..... 🤣🤣🤣"
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Dems under Biden have changed massive amounts of regulations without congressional votes...without the knowledge of the people!  Massive undermining of our freedoms are well under way with more coming and people won't know until too late,   For example they are restricting access to BLM land including ""foot prints"". i.e. no hiking, fishing, hunting on BLM land...they are going for our national parks.  Covert land grabs in the name of environmental benefits...the Biden now Harris admin's SCC is still actively pursuing to commodify the national parks...defeated once but they won't give up on that.  Nightmare unfolding!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"I always enjoy listening to what you have to say, but can't watch the videos anymore. Those unnecessary jump cuts that zoom slightly closer to your face are too distracting. You don't need to use ""scare edits"" to hold the viewer's attention every couple of seconds. If any of your viewers have attention spans of only 2 seconds, they probably can't follow most of what you're saying anyway. I wish you wouldn't dumb your presentation down. But either way, I'll still keep listening to the audio. Thank you."
OFi73TzEN_8,I csn give you literally year by year what biden has done.....
OFi73TzEN_8,It happens when you want to play it progressively while trying keep being a dirty capitalist.
OFi73TzEN_8,"mainwhile we in France have a monarchy, because clearly we are not even in a representative government.

OFi73TzEN_8,"I get it. Its still really not good to put this out during this particular election cycle. Theres only a handful of progressives in government while almost half are descending into fascism. This would be a perfect video directly following a Harris victory, but dissuading even a couple of people from voting is just stupid if you actually value progress."
OFi73TzEN_8,"You can elect Democrats to a super majority Senate and House and somehow Dems won’t get anything done…IE 2009-2011.

It’s almost like Dems and Republicans play good cop/bad cop."

OFi73TzEN_8,"This perspective is so eye-opening. As a conservative, it always seems to me that Republicans do nothing when they have power and Democrats get a lot done when they have power. Meanwhile, liberals think the opposite. It's almost like they're pitting us against each other to keep power...."

Of course on both sides of the isle, there is always a lot of conflict over bills, especially when you have undercover Republicans pretending to be Democrats like Lieberman, who was tasked with sabotaging the Democrat's bills. And WTF are you talking about that the Democrats don't get anything done? They've accomplished more for the US economy, & passed more bills than ever, in this administration, & the US economy is now the strongest in the world thanks to the Biden-Harris team.

You will never find such dissension in the Republican party- look how they fall in line for trump even tho they dislike  him"
OFi73TzEN_8,"they do, but def not as much as they should. i mean, did you see the clown show republicans gave this congress?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Biden succeeded in giving us the most inflation in recent history.  He also succeeded on bringing in 10-20 million criminals over the southern border.  He gave us a 35 trillion dollar debt trying to buy your votes, what more do you want?"
OFi73TzEN_8,Progressive policies are destructive.  If democrats did what they promised we'd default on our debt obligations.  Sad thing is democrats accomplish just enough to guarantee we will ultimately default and America is doomed.
OFi73TzEN_8,Republicans are party über Alles. Democrats always have just enough people in the party who will stand by their values just enough to vote against something the party brought up just because it's not perfect.
OFi73TzEN_8,"The funniest example was right after the 2020 election, Biden campaigned that he would get $2k checks out to everyone if they voted for those two Dems in Georgia. They won, and instead he cut $1400 checks because Trump had previously given out $600 checks like a year ago, so it added up to 2000. Lol, and then a year later ""progressives"" were still defending them and doing those ""Dark Brandon"" memes. Remember those? Yeah, that aged well. But are you guys gonna vote Democrat again this year? If you watched this whole video you know what they are. If you knowingly fall for this while watching videos and leaving comments talking about it, I'm afraid you're beyond help."
OFi73TzEN_8,"""The Republican believe in their lies just as much as Democrats believe in their truth"""
OFi73TzEN_8,Not sure why they didn't take the time to rewrite this given that Biden has dropped out of the race. Accurate content is better than fast content.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Power comes from organized masses? What organized masses? I live in Jamal Bowman's district. Latimer demolished him. Latimer beat Bowman in a landslide by almost 20% of the vote. The Democratic Party is centrist because the voters are centrist. Sure, there are a handful of actual progressive districts, but the overwhelming majority of American voters are right-wing or center-right. Both parties usually fail to enact an agenda. No party has more than 20 months before the electorate votes them out anyway. The real organized majority are those people who prefer government inaction on any given issue. And while that's depressing, the will of the voters is always clearly to the right of people like us. These videos get relatively few views compared to the mountain of right leaning media that most Americans view regularly. Even here in the Bronx/ Westchester area, people are pretty damn conservative. And from what I've seen, this area is to the left of 80% of the US."
OFi73TzEN_8,"They do. The American economy is performing very well, American security is stronger, jobs in the market have exploded in numbers. Inflation has been reduced. They have accomplished a lot."
OFi73TzEN_8,Ok so crazy idea why don't we just have n absolute monarchy instead?
OFi73TzEN_8,"The term ""conservative democrat"" is a crazy oxymoron to hear actually used"
OFi73TzEN_8,Biden was never a progressive. Sorry to tell you.
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Australian Greens party's entire philosophy is to deprive Labor of progressive voters and to obstruct progressive bills, so I really felt it when JT mentioned at the end one of those Democrats being from a Green party"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Since we only get two choices at best on one issue with every vote.   It effectively means all the thousands of other issues that we don't vote on are available to the same politicians for sale. 

So of course you're going to see more and more dysfunction and corruption as you create more and more centralized systems that have to somehow answer to the people via The same ever more obscurely distant electoral bottleneck. 

This is the institutional problem that destroys republics.   

It ties into topic when you remember that our founders created a minimalist government designed to resist this by creating dysfunction where there was disagreement.   Which is  to say the federal government is designed to fail at passing bills precisely to keep divisive issues local and a number of things on which we must vote few for as long as possible.

The alternative is either break up or collapse. Currently we're trending towards collapse with 35 trillion dollar deficit as well as growing calls for a breakup.  In recognition of what's going to happen as a result of the collapse."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Is it that all political figures (politicians) are corrupt, or is it that the corporate capitalist system is corrupt and thus all those politicians who are bought by it."

OFi73TzEN_8,"I appreciate the critical analysis, we need to weed out the corporate interests and greed, but it seems like y'all completely overlooked the Infrastructure Bill and Inflation Reduction Act. Can you do this same analysis, but with GOP?"

OFi73TzEN_8,"Spot on. Having worked in American politics, I can say I've seen every aspect of this argument play out in real life."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Oh my god! Parez lives in a pretty special district, she's considered too far left for her district even with being a blue dog. The 3rd CD overlaps with the 19th LD which is the home of the chair of the state Republican party. She's honestly the best the state party can put forth in that CD"
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is republican propaganda. This and ""my vote doesn't count"" are the two greatest voter suppression campaigns the Republicans employ. It's way worse than all the laws red states pass to make it harder to vote.

But that lack of progressive members of Congress is a very real problem. I am a progressive. But a former republican. I only changed parties to vote for Bernie. The problem is progressives are generally younger, and expect participation trophies. They don't show up and vote. It is really hard to get things done like this. We have only given dems a super majority for 72 days in the last 16 years. That's when they passed Obamacare.

If progressives showed up to vote, then Texas would be blue. If democrats who have already voted in the past (so voter suppression doesn't count for them) we could easily have 2/3rds majority and actually start having progressive reforms. In new York, progressives didn't show up to the primaries so we lost Jamal Bowman. In TX progressives didn't show up so we have Ted Cruz. 

Republicans play the long game. Republicans never say ""my vote doesn't count"", and Republicans never complain that their party isn't getting things done. That's how you know it's propaganda. They can't win playing fair and square, so they use propaganda to turn us against our own party. They are masters at getting people to work against their best interests. 

If every progressive voted in every election, then change would happen. We have to unite!!! Don't like colleges that are deeply invested in Isreal and geno-cide? College officials are voted in. Don't like the candidates? Then find some to run or do it yourself. 

Complaining on social media is worthless (this rant is even more worthless). Protesting is worthless unless you are willing to vote don't bother protesting. I don't understand why someone would go to a protest that is significantly more dangerous and harder to do than actual voting?!? If we all vote for whoever is closest to our values no matter how imperfect we can shift the Overton window back to the left. But that HAS to start with the deeply flawed candidates we have now. Then we can push even further left next time in 2 years."
OFi73TzEN_8,"‘Managed Democracy’ lol, who knew helldivers was so accurate"
OFi73TzEN_8,If I lived in the US I would (as a leftist) probably vote republican just to piss off liberals. It doesn't matter anyways.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Obama was completely against a public option as well. He said it can't work in America. 

I've been watching this for decades. Why do we always give subsidies to fossil fuels when they make huge profits? Every single bill introduced to end the subsidies fails. If any bill submitted that would change the flow of money, right or left, always fails. 

Not until we remove money from campaigns and lobbyists will we ever have any real change."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Howdy, my retired prof introduced your channel to me.  I spent last night going thru your vids.  While I agree that more could be done on all fronts you address, your views are teetering on Leftist extremist.  You not only are disgusted by the Right, you alienate the Middle after offering some pros and cons and history on political topics.  The more I watch, the more you push away the Left and head for Bernie fringe territory.  America needs a revolution.  It does not need flat-earth Socialism.  That's what you make your position sound like.  Too far left.  As you are a journalist, a net neutrality is key.  Stick to the facts - like how you called out the Times for not stating truth in its headlines.  That is respectable.  Identify with your convictions.  But beware the cliff you Bungy jump off here and there."
OFi73TzEN_8,Its rediculous how obvious conservative the Democracts are yet the Republicans can still get away with calling them extremists.
OFi73TzEN_8,"that gridlock state got destroyed in Mexico back in 2018, then came the ""must invade because cartels"" so you guys dont learn what happened and how to maneuver your gained seats in government. Its also the reason you hear sssooo much about some ""narcostate"""
OFi73TzEN_8,"I'm not a socialist, and I don't think I ever will be. Then again, I don't believe in our current form of ""capitalism"" either. I believe more in the gold standard which was fully eliminated in the 60's during Nixon's reign. Nor do I feel that socialists and capitalists should be at each other's throats either like it's the cold war all over again. Regardless, of what we stand for and of who we are, we need to stand united, as what are the states without being able to do that?

Regardless of economic structure, I'm a centrist. There are certain things on either side I agree with. That said I don't really believe in either party. There was a time where each had its shine, but that luster is long gone. Both are about as corrupt as its counterpart.

It's unfortunate, as In the past both political parties were the same. They were called the Democratic-Republican party. They split up shortly before the Civil War with The Democrats moving south, and some of the right becoming what were known as The Whig party. Anti-slavery democrats AND anti-slavery republicans joined together then to form The Republican party in the mid 1850s."

OFi73TzEN_8,"It was the same thing with Obomber. He had all the power when he first won, on top of a global financial crysis that gave him even more power to do things like stop Wall Street. But he did the opposite, because he IS Wall Street"
OFi73TzEN_8,"If Biden or any president trully wanted to pass a bill they could do lots more to actually pass it. They don't need reconciliation or any of that bullshit. Just by promising to destroy any senator that obstructs, things would change. Imagine being an actual popular president who the public sees they are fighting for the voters. Imagine that president using the bully pulpit and rallying the voters to challenge any single senator that dares to obstruct.

That is exactly what Sanders said he was going to do if he were president."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats lose middle class and working class voters because they are so unused to using the power they get.. they only take half measure and create means tested programs benefiting a fraction of taxpayers, further alienating their natural constituency."
OFi73TzEN_8,"It's important for everyone to read Project 25. Any Republican president who takes office could threaten job security and eliminate funding for some government agencies, especially newer ones. The president doesn't have to be Trump—just a Republican. Additionally, we need to vote for a Democrat for senator because the seat is open. This will help ensure that Republicans do not dominate the House."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Just as we don't want the majority to tyrannize the minority, we don't want the minority to tyrannize the majority. There lies the rub. That balancing act is difficult and ugly with the electorate reluctantly accepting the results. It's a feature of our government not a bug.

Only under an absolute ruler supported by one ideology do you have no divisions in government but it's a disaster for the people.
Does that sound like a better system of government? I don't think so."
OFi73TzEN_8,Helldiver's has taught me Managed Democracy is actually super patriotic.
OFi73TzEN_8,Joe Biden got more done than any other president in the last 50 years.
OFi73TzEN_8,"So unappreciative. At least 13 Democrats lost their seats as a direct result of voting for the ACA. Dems weren't ""let of the hook"" as much as asked to sacrifice themselves for a progressive cause.  So much so, when the ACA was passed, members of the GOP mocked the moderate Demacrsts waving good-bye to them. And how do Dems ""not accomplish anything"" when they passed the  infrastructure bill, the environmental bill (in the anti-inflation act) and the Chips Act.  I'm so sick of Congress passing something we've been trying to do for 50 years and it isn't recognized."
OFi73TzEN_8,Both sides are as crooked as they come. Rfk jr 2024
OFi73TzEN_8,"Second Thought YOU ARE WRONG & Biased. Joe Biden has done a lot for the Progressive Movement. Look at his Records and Achievements. Look at the Positive side. He's the Most Progressive President in recent times. Rome was never built in a day. For the Democratic Party to Make the Radical Policies you want it either needs a landslide victory that will bear no retaliatory consequences to it's Policies or fight long enough to get what they want. This is becoz The Democratic Party is not a Party. It's a coalition of Liberals, Centrists, Moderates, Corporate Interests, Corporate lobbyists, Environmentalists etc with each faction fighting to get their Agenda passed often needing the support of each other. It's why they are constantly at loggerheads. It's not Biden's fault because Progressives are impatient and have been doing a Poor job in selling their New Ideas to the Public. They imagine everybody is educated and have the same level of reasoning & understanding as they. They are wrong. Then they do what you're doing, attacking the very people who are willing to support or fight alongside them. Furthering divisions, losing focus and selling a defeatus attitude which only helps Political opponents who when given a little opportunity will place blockades. Progressives must learn to be in the fight and keep in the fight as long as it takes. How long did it take for conservatives to plot and overturn Roe v Wade? It took then decades. Progressives must learn the virtue of Patience or we'll end up like Iran where they find themselves trapped underneath authoritarian theocracy."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Good video! I think that one aspect that you hint at but that needs emphasis is the value of the wedge issue, exemplified by the abortion issue. In 2007, Obama told Planned Parenthood that the first thing he would do once elected is sign legislation on abortion. When he got in with a supermajority it suddenly became a non-priority, and I think a primary reason for that is that the Democrats can always run on pro-choice as long as it is not codified into law. If it were actually be legislated, then it would be less of a wedge issue."

OFi73TzEN_8,"You've gotta get this healthcare stuff sorted. The NHS in the UK is one of the biggest employers in the world, it's an absolutely massive organisation, and one of the benefits of that is that the NHS bullies the fuck out of pharmaceutical companies over drug prices. Big pharma has been chipping away at the NHS for decades now because of this. The private pharmaceutical industry doesn't like being bullied by the NHS over drug prices, but I don't care. They'll get what they're given and they'll shut up.

Combined with the private insurance sector chipping away at the NHS because it prevents people getting private insurance at massively inflated rates, our NHS is on it's knees. It's struggling to hold on, while our politicians try to convince themselves that the public sector doesn't do anything well."

How is abortion in your state right now?

How can we as ants in the colony facilitate this? If only, the right group of talented/skilled people, could make her and the party messages, go viral... the 'chance' of success would rocket! It's so difficult to live in a world with 'Hawk Tuah Girls' and 'Backpack Kids' being the predominate driving forces of society, when there're are _real_ problems and, people, strong willed and sharp minded, with real solutions, and, the arguably insane desire, to do the work, to _save_ said society, being largely ignored or made completely irrelevant.

People over Profit.  Anti-War profiteers.  Anti-school to (private) prison pipeline.  Anti-police state and 1st amendment erosion. Pro Universal Healthcare, Pro Environment, Progressive tax reforms to tax the billionaires and provide opportunites to working class poor. Be honest, become the change we wish to see.  Join the #grassrootsdemocracy and support the Green Party. We desperately need actual change. Not Obama's 'Hope™' and 'Change®' which only funneled our populist movement into more war... more record corporate profits, historic shifted wealth from the working-class to the ultra-wealthy. Fears that Drumpf won't leave power if reelected, push people to 'vote blue not matter who.'  Harris stepping in has people feeling joy for a female and POC POTUS. But that's beyond superficial. The powerful are painfully out of touch!  It _has_ to stop.  We need to stand up and make a concerted effort to Unite the Left and fight back and win.  The French banded their diverse left wing parties into one _independent!_ party, last minute (in about 30 days time) that no one took seriously.  They BEAT their powerful opponents in the ballot box.

OFi73TzEN_8,America is a techno feudalist pseudo croni-capitalistic democratically inspired oligarchy
OFi73TzEN_8,"Uploaded 2 days ago, when Kamala is running."
OFi73TzEN_8,"It's all pro-wrestling. On camera, in session, it's all bickering and feud among each other but behind scenes, they're all friends. 

The sad part is the Democratic Party loyalists that still believe the political theater and the Democrats are trying their best and blame the filibuster rule and ""Democrats don't know how to message well."" Come on, most Democrats are Ivy League undergrad law school graduates."
OFi73TzEN_8,Nice.
OFi73TzEN_8,"A good argument for staying home and uninvested on Election Day. I’ve been giving less and less of a shit about who gets into office, because they’re all the same either way. They play off each other to keep people invested."

OFi73TzEN_8,Neither do the republicans. That’s their plan to destroy America
OFi73TzEN_8,"Biden also promised a public option for Obamacare.  He never mentioned that again once he got elected.  Republicans of course, want to get rid of Obamacare altogether which means you will be discriminated against for having any pre-existing condition, the one good thing about Obamacare."
OFi73TzEN_8,9:03 How are Republicans and Democrats nearly identical? Would love a side by side chart or Venn diagram with the rhetorical and  policy/related overlaps.
OFi73TzEN_8,"I agree, but the filibuster was still in place."
OFi73TzEN_8,"How about you list all the Bills President has passed???

fyi, it's a long list"
OFi73TzEN_8,"I know it was touched on slightly , but still bears mentioning. The US has a stunted political spectrum, what is sold as leftist in the US would be left of center elsewhere"
OFi73TzEN_8,"If only the general populace were better informed! Corporate hacks would be voted out entirely, if so. But mainstream media is corporate media, so therein lies the root of the problem. If more voters were to tune in to alternative / independent media such as Second Thought, we would be living in a whole new world. A better one. But no, we have most people watching the likes of Fox and MSNBC. If corporate 'news' keeps being the go-to source for the majority, then we are eternally f-kt."
OFi73TzEN_8,So vote blue no matter who?
OFi73TzEN_8,Abolish everything.
OFi73TzEN_8,"But we're just giving the people something to fight for. if we just give them healthcare, education and a Universal Basic Safety Net, there won't be anything left for them to fight for. Look at the Matrix, how whole batches of humans died because life was too comfortable and they knew that something was wrong. rotfl Just kidding. I know reality from fiction, unlike most republicans who believe that everything in their little book of fairytales actually happened. God said, let there be light and there was light. I don't care that he hadn't made the sun yet. Human's didn't evolve and Noah's arc is why we have fossils. Neanderthals are decedents of Ham, Noah's son."
OFi73TzEN_8,"You should do a video on the uhuru 3 trial coming up on Sept 3rd. The fbi has charge 81 year old Omali Yeshitela with working for the Russian government. Literally, even Tucker Carlson has said they are bogus charges! It's a total attack on free speech and they want him to serve the next 15 years in prison."

OFi73TzEN_8,If a president gets elected mf vote gona bee worthe 20 people one line bitche vote Nha the presidents vote should bee 20 people votes in Congress then the rest of Congress should bee halfd and should fire Evry singel bitch who gets money from 3rd partys and the president should have the right too fire any and all Congress people that he and the internal afers seems like a threat too democracy
OFi73TzEN_8,"Imagine being dumb enough to not grasp that NOW is not the time to be assaukting the Dems. 

Listen kids, I've been a Marxist since before most of you were even alive. 

Now is not the time.

Pull your head out of your idealist utopian asses, and recognize the current problem.

Fascism is very close.

Is your Proletariat Revolt anywhere near a viable possibility???

Then stfu and recognize what the actual solution is:

Support the Dem chair until the election is over.

As soon as we are safe..  get back to shaming Libs.    

But until then. Youre just encouraging the 3rd party idiots. 

And any vote not for the Dem chair is a vote for Trump.


Welcome to Logic 101."

OFi73TzEN_8,"bro he is not even running in this election so oopsie you phoned this one in for sure

bad look, friend"
OFi73TzEN_8,I wonder if there is a way to capitalize on the permissive regulations on campaign finance? Maybe set up two 401c charities one to cater to each partisan extreme. Use some of the funds to bribe politicians into supporting the PACs to drum up more funds. Cater to all the usual dog whistles for the various audiences and groups in each camp. But after the promotion and advertising to the parties funnel donations from each PAC into a third black money PAC to help build a viable third party. Get people on the legislation full time to offer based analysis to the public and offer viable alternatives. Create party lobbyists to run interference with the corporate ones. Once people know what they are about run candidates from the bottom up.
OFi73TzEN_8,Bruh what is your hairstyle? Do you have a perm? Lmao
OFi73TzEN_8,They are woke and promoted LGBT agenda …. They want to kill culture
OFi73TzEN_8,""".. all the power you can get in American politics ..."" Until you said that, Second Thought, I was willing to listen - even though you'd skipped over the fact that Trump had, in fact, obstructed pasage of the border bill for purely political purposes. But your statement that from 2021-2023, Democrats had ""all the power you can get in American politics"" was so obviously false you merited no more of my time. (Reminders. First, there are three branches of government and, as the last Supreme Court term established, the Supreme Court is controlled by MAGA. Second, many bills in the Senate require a 60-vote majority for passage. Democrats did not come close to a 60 vote majority. Third, compared to Trump, Biden enjoyed tremendous legislative success. Your entire premise was wrong.)"
OFi73TzEN_8,Lucky. We didn't get everything he promised or we would really be in  debt. Now
OFi73TzEN_8,"John Fetterman: ""Now with these surgery scars, my transformation into the Rotating Villain is complete!"""

OFi73TzEN_8,I can't tell if you're bad faith or just love the smell of your own farts.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Yeah, okay.  Fine.  But a vote for Adolph Twitter will be horrifying worse."
OFi73TzEN_8,Another possibly related subject I'd be interested to see more information on is whether the touted Biden accomplishments are actually good or are really just things that don't disturb the big corporations too much. For example the Chips act is one of the big three things always bragged about. But you may remember that Bernie Sanders gave a speech on the Senate floor opposing it. One reason was that these chip companies already had plenty of money to invest in more chip fabrication if they wanted to but chose not to. So we didn't need to hand them taxpayer money. Meanwhile even leftist media like Thom Hartman and Randi Rhodes celebrate Biden's record. Are they right?
OFi73TzEN_8,They say that republicans have no principles and democrats have no spine. But it’s really because they don’t work for us and would rather lose to trump than win with Bernie.
OFi73TzEN_8,"I see you’ve been buying into the trumpian/russian propaganda, and do not understand that the trumpers have blocked just about anything the Democrats have tried to do. Why do you think Kamala Harris had to break tie after tie after tie after tie in the Senate?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"I am not a socialist and I actually think that Israel is on the less-wrong end of the fight in Gaza (I do believe the settlements in the West Bank should be torn down though) but I do really appreciate this content.  Our duopolistic political system combined with our atrocious “lobbying” (aka bribery) culture makes it very easy for the wealthy to capture power.  It also makes it easy to force people to vote for candidates they do not like because the other candidate is worse.  I am not a socialist but I believe monopolies (and de facto monopolies) are poison, I am virulently opposed to the West Bank settlements but I also think absolutely crushing Hamas’ military infrastructure is absolutely justified, even if Hamas insists on using their own citizens as human shields.  The list goes on but neither of the two party power structures(that increasingly demand homogeneity from their candidates) represent what I believe.  We have to have a much more decentralized (and numerous) amount of parties to prevent their capture by the wealthy."
OFi73TzEN_8,We really NEED to get $ OUT of politics 😊
OFi73TzEN_8,"I don't get why Democrats are so pro-immigration. Doesn't it just weaken labor unions? It also seems to create cultural disunity in large cities, non-assimilating neighborhoods, and a generally less educated and environmentally conscious populace, because people from poorer countries often couldn't afford to care about public waste management and litter, and public schools have to adjust their curricula to accommodate less educated kids, so that grades will be high enough to justify continued funding."
OFi73TzEN_8,Hey at least democrats actually try to do their job. They know the political system is flawed but they work with it.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Gotta say… I have a feeling you wouldn’t have such a smug smirk on your face in the beginning on Biden if you had to make this video under a fascism regime—what this video would help bring about, if not for Kamala’s announcement. Makes me wonder if you actually want things to get better?"
OFi73TzEN_8,Hasn't Joe Biden's current term been really successful?
OFi73TzEN_8,Very informative and insightful
OFi73TzEN_8,"In reality, the USA is not a democracy but an oligarchical two party system which the mainstream media never questions.
Both parties are financed and corrupted by big money.
They only play ""democrats"" and ""republicans"". 
The whole propaganda apparatus does everything to prevent any other party from endangering the oligarchical two party - system.
The number of Americans who feel manipulated and betrayed by these politicians  and therefore feel hate towards the elitist oligarchical system, which calls itself a ""democracy"", is constantly rising.
That's why the far right fascist Republicans of today, their psychopathic criminal leader Trump as their ""führer"" and the christo - fascists/evangelicals have so much sympathizers and fanatics among them in the USA. 
If these Republican fascists and their führer Trump really come to power in November 2024, they will realize their ""Project 2025"" and establish a fascist republican one party - dictatorship in the USA and the basic freedoms of Americans will disappear!!!!
I'm very happy that I live in a country that resembles much more a real democracy  than the USA."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Speaking on this I noticed that the first democrats to go against Biden were members of the conservative core quite probably because they don't like that Biden in the latter part of his term reactivated the antitrust laws that have been collecting dust since Regan came to power and gutted them through policy decisions.

I unfortunately suspect Harris as the natural successor is liable to reverse course on these policies but because of the structure of this dystopian 2 party system there isn't anything I can think of to do about this. What can we do? I keep hearing we need to grass roots mobilize but how? How?!?"
OFi73TzEN_8,Johnny Silverhand is… a *Bad Guy*… right?
OFi73TzEN_8,Biden did keep what promises he could . Republicans blocked him so he could not finish all his promises. He did more than Trump did for the people. You can fact check that . Kamala will finish promises because we the people will. Vote straight blue . We do not wand Mega that don ‘t work with Democrats like the good Republicans did. We want a President that works for the people not a convicted lying felon A wanna be Dictator . That will not fly in America. We want to keep our constitution. Not to mention Trump is a trader to are country. Go blue for freedom 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
OFi73TzEN_8,"And??? As a conservative independent, I see exactly the same behavior from both parties.
Except these last two years the GOP didn't even try to legislate from the House. They spent an incredible amount of time and resource trying to find something that Joe Biden was guilty of. I have to tell you, after all that, they convinced me that Joe Biden is the squeaky cleanest President in American history."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Im glad you have a platform.
Now STFU and start being PROactive instead of REactive.
You 'This lil light of mine' shining ..."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Straight up BS. This isn't a parliament system which so many 100% believe it is, its much more stupid.  I mostly agree with this channel but this shows a serious lack of understanding of our stupid over complicated system. Literally ALL of the surge in battery tech that is looking to completely turn our and several other nation's grids completely renewable by 2030(5 years earlier than Biden promised) is due to his two spending bills he passed through a loophole.  These $chills shift their votes because their rich benefactors up their golden parachute package if they lose like what happened with Sinema who run on completely progressive values for years and then sold out massively once she got to the senate.  Biden came from an era where they actually felt good about getting things done.  He is one of the poorest members of the senate."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Every single one of the ""broken promises"" you mentioned in the beginning haven't happened because of REPUBLICAN interference. You're full of shit!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Clearly designed to say that the democrats are all the problem, but then goes on to target very specific democrats. Why not just craft this video a bit more honestly? Unless your claim really is “those who let these democrats stay in office are the real problem, not those specific democrats themselves”. If so, that’s a weird claim"
OFi73TzEN_8,Well you actually talking about french politics without talking about french politics
OFi73TzEN_8,Well the good thing is that neither Democrats nor Kamala need votes from doomer Bernie bros.
OFi73TzEN_8,"BTW, for those of you who were unaware, it is the mindset described in this video that also reveals/explains why Joe Biden self-sabotaged his own student loan debt forgiveness plan by giving Republicans the chance to challenge the plan in court, against the advice of those who actually wanted to see the plan implemented.  Biden and Democrats are even worse than Republicans.  At least the Republicans tell you EXACTLY who they are.  Democrats will run their campaigns on progressive policies they know are popular, but then create every excuse under the sun as to why they failed to actually follow through.  But, at the end of the day, the real villains are Democratic voters who, time and time again, will REWARD this bad behavior by re-electing these mainstream, corrupt Democrats back into power to sabotage themselves all over again.  Whether they are just Blue MAGA or they fall victim to the same fear-based politics they ironically mock Republicans for, they are at fault for refusing to hold the Democratic party accountable for its failures."
OFi73TzEN_8,"""Lobbying"" is just a milder way to say CORRUPTION! and ""donation""is just another word for BRIBE!"

OFi73TzEN_8,The US has a one party system trying too hard to look like a democracy
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democracies work better without corporate lobbying, even if on the face of it, the European Union doesn’t seem all that transparent or democratic, there are much stricter rules for lobbying and campaign funding. The EU also has taken some measures that big tech and monopolies weren’t happy about, breaking business models of Apple, google and the likes. Alas we aren’t lobby-free but it’s better and European parlement members less busy with scoring points on social media compared to national level politicians. (Who, in the Netherlands also become grid-locked even if more plural in nature: big money finds a way to kill the compromise model that worked so well in the Netherlands in the nineties)"
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is why politicians love culture wars. Perfect to mobilize ppl without promising anything, just protect something already established."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Every day another phonecall from Democrats telling me how horrible the Republicans are. And how ""we have to stop them"". Except there is no ""WE"" - there is one party in two minor flavors serving the top 1% and there is the rest of us.

OFi73TzEN_8,"The ""job"" of the democrats is the hold the ball for 4-8 years until the dumb, bored US populace kicks them out and allows the GOP to further ratfuck the country for their 4-8. Then the Dems run on hope and change, swoop in to ""save"" the country, and do nothing for 4-8 years until people get bored again. Repeat ad nauseum until 50 people own 95% of the wealth, and the rest endure serfdom."
OFi73TzEN_8,It's wild to say they never get anything done when they're the only party who ever gets anything passed that isn't tax cuts for the rich. Manchin and Sinema are independents now... Sinema will never win another election again. Manchin has always been a right winger and controls much of WV jobs so he'll probably be reelected but at least it won't be as a democrat. The party and voting base is moving more progressive and shit isn't going to drastically happen in even 2 presidential cycles. I hate the democratic party as it is now but it's still millions of times better than the republican party.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Same reason Second Thought drives supercars: 

The system provides a great many comforts to the people who aren't completely destitute, so it's better for both the DNC and pretend-leftists like him to pay lip service to their plight instead of devoting all their resources to it."

Vote Independents?!😩"
OFi73TzEN_8,Politicians should be bound by law to vote according to their campaign promises.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Yeah but Biden promised to make abortion legal nationwide, if he's elected again! It's because you didn't want him to run again, that he can't do it now!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"It is funny for me than ”lobbying"" is normal for Americans."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Even in Russia, where there was a strong Marxist school of thought, there is about 10 people on YouTube who actually know what they are talking about when it comes to socialism and some of them are already being prosecuted.

OFi73TzEN_8,Trump is evil but kamala Harris is the devil's mother
OFi73TzEN_8,"Any Democrat who actually  wants to get things done gets labelled as Socialists, radical, far left, communists etc by those on the right and on top of that the DNC always pull strings to make sure such people aren't nominated in order to keep their corporate donors happy and the cheques rolling in 😂"

OFi73TzEN_8,Trump promised 2 build a wall n Mexicans would pay 4 it
OFi73TzEN_8,"This also perfectly aligns with why democrats are just as against freedom of assembly. They might claim they are pro-union or pro-first amendment but when it comes down to it they pass just as many laws preventing protests and demonstrations and anything that will sideline groups of people getting together to speak truth to power.  And let’s not forget how badly they bash protestors 
 with strawman lies on left wing media just as much as fox or the like. Democrats are just as involved in their government actions cracking down and arresting peaceful protestors, militarizing police to be used specifically against freedom of assembly… there’s no other reason to militarize police, they are local and meant to protect civilians, yet go out there and cause chaos when people are practicing their first amendment rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. If democrats were genuine in their commitment to the people, they wouldn’t be so aggressive in stopping them from collectively working together for change."

OFi73TzEN_8,America is slowly collapsing from its own hubris
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats seem to be more authoritarian than many milquetoast Republicans are at this point. I've always landed left in opinion on most issues and bought into it for years, but it's really starting to seem like leftist philosophy isn't practically functional in practice. I could be wrong, (most people are at some point) but at this point I at least want somebody who will hit the breaks and reset things enough that we can maintain the same freedoms and opportunities that our grandparents had, because the endless need for growth and the endless longing for control of the working class aren't vibing with me. I prefer to keep my arms and future  access to them thank you very much, and I want pro choice to be enshrined in the constitution because it's the ultimate representation of bodily autonomy. The political warfare is only destroying rights and encouraging political violence"
OFi73TzEN_8,"I'm an Australian who watches a lot of politics. I can tell you that you don't have a left wing in the US, not really. The LNP is Australia's conservative party, they're to the left of the Dems on some issues. That's called the ratchet effect on the overton window for anyone who is unaware.

What you need primarily in the US is what you call ranked choice voting. We call it preferential voting here, essentially it means you can vote your conscience and so long as you know where your preference is going, your vote is never wasted. Voting is also compulsory here.

Once you have ranked choice, the GOP will never win another election. You'll end up with the Dems being the more conservative party and whatever the new progressive party is called. 

An upheaval of power like that would provide the perfect opportunity to get money out of politics and un-rat-fuck SCOTUS. So much could be achieved if you just had that one change to your electoral commission. Preferential voting will get you that third political party that actually is full to the brim of leftists. Also, GOP politics would change - it'd no longer be a race to the bottom as they'd have to compete in the market place of ideas. Which isn't dissimilar to challenging a quadruple amputee to a footrace.

Which is why it'll never happen."

Democrats are paid to do nothing and make sure that anything that will actually help working class people dies.  They use the ""rotating villain"" strategy and everything works exactly how its designed to.  I tell these people to stop voting for candidates that have been these villains in the past but I'm constantly told ""we have to vote blue no matter who or the Republicans will take all of our rights away"".  I tell them that a Democrat that votes for the Republicans IS A REPUBLICAN.  I simply just can't talk to people about politics anymore.  We are too uneducated, too stupid, and too overworked to ever do what we need to do.  The overton window will continue to more right and the earth will burn.  Rant over."

OFi73TzEN_8,"And this is why I stopped voting decades ago - both parties are owned by the same set of corporate oligarchs, so why bother?"
OFi73TzEN_8,Informative experience
OFi73TzEN_8,"Dude, they do,

really funny how you americans really think you choose between left or right politicians. There's just crazy far right mf and not so crazy right mf... The democrats do EXACTLY what they are suposed to do"
OFi73TzEN_8,I'll be voting for Cornel West if they let me.
OFi73TzEN_8,now do why are republicans so evil
OFi73TzEN_8,"Okay, but can we agree that for now, getting nothing done is a lot better than GQP getting a lot done?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Anyway the U.S vote they will always be conned, and the most scaring thing is that they all know it!...
American politics are the same as Superbowl, and with equal impact on American society..."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The US Congress is thoroughly corrupted by MONEY. US democracy is a fallacy, an illusion."
OFi73TzEN_8,MANAGED DEMOCRACY MENTIONED 🦅
OFi73TzEN_8,"For the record, the United States is actually an 'electoral plutocracy.'  What I will never be able to understand is why the political spectrum of the United States is so heavily – and dangerously – skewed toward the far-right."
OFi73TzEN_8,"‘ Remember, democracy never last long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide’
John Adams"
OFi73TzEN_8,The extraordinarily cumbersome system of 'checks-and-balances' that the Founding Fathers devised has never excelled at the fostering of an enhanced level of both accountability and transparency.  That is why I strongly feel that the United States ought to undertake the monumental conversion from the presidential-congressional régime to the parliamentary régime.
OFi73TzEN_8,Denicrats: useless. Conservatives/republicans: evil
OFi73TzEN_8,"Not sure I'd label Jamal Bowman as ""progressive""..."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Republicans have no heart.
Democrats have no spine."
OFi73TzEN_8,Thanks!
OFi73TzEN_8,"Oh my god, I thought ""Managed Democracy"" was just Helldivers 2 rhetoric."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Doesn't get anything done....
.
Yet you also bi-tch about ""build back better"".... and other things they got done
.
.
You resistance republicans are REALLY desperate after Biden dropped out....
.
Thought you had an easy win in the bag. And now all you guys do is cope."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Checks out, we've got the best government money can buy"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Most Democrats are actually Republicans. They pretend to oppose the Republicans but vote with them or go out of their way to shoot themselves in the foot. They say they tried and if you want them to keep trying, you will re-elect them but at no point are they actually trying. This is a horse and pony show and nothing more. It gives us the illusion of a choice and ensures job security for the opposition that never actually opposes anything the Republicans are doing. We are being played."
OFi73TzEN_8,""" put in place to empower a corporate minority and block any form of majority rule that doesn't align with its preferences so under this system winning for the Democrats doesn't mean getting enough seats to do whatever they want they win the game of politics when they can get just enough seats to do the bare minimum and keep voters coming back without seriously upsetting the corporate backers whose influence is much more important""

yup absolutely.
so my usual question... how do people  that want out of that system bring tangible  change? 
what systems are in place  for us to turn to? 
what can we work with within the current system to bring to fruition the the preferred systems."
OFi73TzEN_8,I'm really happy to see a socialist channel growing.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Depressing, but very good perspective"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Finally someone explains how I feel. For years I've been saying the democrats do just enough to keep peoppe voting, but never actually do what they say."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The US Government is a scam for money laundering.  It’s all charades, shenanigans, propaganda and psychological warfare to keep the wheels of machines spinning to parade as a democracy.  All feds have bought into fascism, and we see massive performance, or cover.  We are all played and duped.  People cannot even emotionally digest how we’ve all been sabotaged, exploited and used."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Regardless of party, it's always someone else's fault.  I firmly believe we have a thriving two-party system -- one for the rich and the other for the rich & powerful."
OFi73TzEN_8,Same thing thats happening in the uk with labour
OFi73TzEN_8,"jt i appreciate the work you do and think your content is great, but i tried to share this video with people i know, who refused to watch it based on the thumbnail alone, which i had barely paid attention to myself. these friends are mostly not as cynical as i am about the democratic party and thought you were pro-maga or something based off of it, which i know isn't true, but i can almost see why they'd think that based on thumbnail"
OFi73TzEN_8,"So how do we fix this? Grass roots movements you say? But movements dont make laws, politicians make laws. This entire video could be titled ""How america blocks progressives (while pretending to be leftists)"""
OFi73TzEN_8,"Man, this video was WAY better than I expected it to be. Good job!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Hmm ... it's the same thing that the more moderate business class Republicans did with the culturally conservative wing of their party back in the '80's, '90's and '00's. They promised they would tackle abortion, gay rights, patriotic themes if only the right wing of the party would elect them. And they did, of course - for awhile, as cultural conservatives had nowhere else to go - that is, until Trump came along. This was described wonderfully by Thomas Frank in What's The Matter With Kansas ? some years back ... 🤔"
OFi73TzEN_8,Doesn’t this also applies to republicans?
OFi73TzEN_8,"The thing is ALL politicians, especially presidential candidates, make big promises that may or may not see the light of day due simply to the fact that such a promise may not actually be possible. That doesn't make them liars that's just politics, people who continuously buy into promises without looking into if they are possible are the real problem. People would also complain if suddenly every politician only made realistic promises, they would say they had no ambition and were not worth voting for."
OFi73TzEN_8,"All I can say is,...pure analytical, factual excellence in describing the political and social mire we live in. 
Sources like _Second Thought, Our Changing Climate,_ and a few others are no BS, clear headed voices that many of those so called 'liberal' or 'progressive' podcasts like _The Daily Beans, The David Feldman Show, David Pakman,_ and many others need to sit down, shut up and pay close attention to."
OFi73TzEN_8,This analysis is utterly correct.

OFi73TzEN_8,I didnt know I could dislike a former senator so strongly. A public option would be aboslutely incredible
OFi73TzEN_8,"As much as I agree and found this video fascinating- please get out and vote for them. Ok it's not great, but it's so important that we don't hand the presidency to Trump"
OFi73TzEN_8,Organize the masses to do what?
OFi73TzEN_8,"-Massive covid stimulus to help people get through a once-in-a-century pandemic
-Huge infrastructure bill to rebuild the country's failing infrastructure with Union labour
-Literally the largest Climate Bill in human history.

But somehow this channel STILL claims that Democrats ""never get anything done"" - what an absolute joke. Why do people take this clown seriously?"
OFi73TzEN_8,Engagement comment
OFi73TzEN_8,"Bro, call it what it is, Its bribery not lobbying."
OFi73TzEN_8,Have we tried given Democrats overwhelming majorities?
OFi73TzEN_8,"Liberals can’t get anything done because their policies aren’t that popular on a national level. They forgot that after Obamacare passed there was a blue wave and many of the democrats who voted for it lost the election. The public was never behind the public option. If liberals want change then they need to get more liberals elected, not blame centrist democrats."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Why you want lgtv & ab0rtion rights for women when your country's birthrate is very low.

OFi73TzEN_8,"i love the production and the effort you are putting into these videos, looks great 👍🏽"
OFi73TzEN_8,The answer is unfortunately very very simple. They’re all completely corrupt and raking in billions from corporations and other interests. The democrats are paid to say the right thing in public and then aggressively keep everything the same while they’re in office.
OFi73TzEN_8,We need communism to rule America #sorrynotsorry #dealwithit
OFi73TzEN_8,"In a free market economy, everything is bought and sold. This system cannot respect human morals, people should understand that already with the amount of misery we have created on this very short existence."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democracy only works when the people being governed largely AGREE on most broad issues. It’s not a system that was designed for two parties that are pretty much from different ideological camps. That’s why people on both sides want separation, revolution."

OFi73TzEN_8,"In reality, the USA is not a democracy but an oligarchical two party system which the mainstream media never questions.
Both parties are financed and corrupted by big money.
They only play ""democrats"" and ""republicans"". 
The whole propaganda apparatus does everything to prevent any other party from endangering the oligarchical two party - system.
The number of Americans who feel manipulated and betrayed by these politicians  and therefore feel hate towards the elitist oligarchical system, which calls itself a ""democracy"", is constantly rising.
That's why the far right fascist Republicans of today, their psychopathic criminal leader Trump as their ""führer"" and the christo - fascists/evangelicals have so much sympathizers and fanatics among them in the USA. 
If these Republican fascists and their führer Trump really come to power in November 2024, they will realize their ""Project 2025"" and establish a fascist republican one party - dictatorship in the USA and the basic freedoms of Americans will disappear!!!!
I'm very happy that I live in a country that resembles much more a real democracy  than the USA."
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats are controlled opposition like the Washington Generals.
OFi73TzEN_8,"We gonna need to do alot, ALOT more work to counter “but the Republicans.”"
OFi73TzEN_8,"The purpose of a two party system is to provide the illusion of choice, while preventing actual good choices from ever being viable options."
OFi73TzEN_8,"THE FACTS NEGATE YOUR PREMISE. Just Google ""Biden's accomplishments"" for the 15 actual accomplishments of the Democrats. Then google Trump's accomplishments and note the lack of any major legislation except another tax cut mostly benefitting the wealthy. His economy was simply coasting on the Obama economy with NO help from Republicans."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Did you ever notice how defensive some people get when we point out that the two major partys in the US share the same goals?  I mean they get unreasonably angry.  They love to point fingers at monoparty states elsewhere in the world but fail to notice our two party state is merely an illusion.  It is as if they need to hold on to that illusion for dear life, elsewise we do not appear to be the democracy we all so love to praise, even as we have so little understanding what a true democracy might look like.  I am fascinated by our capacity for self-delusion & that is why I appreciate Second Thought so much."
OFi73TzEN_8,They don't want to.

OFi73TzEN_8,The real issue is that progressives are really bad at messaging.

OFi73TzEN_8,"From Australia.

The world needs a progressive America.

We have had the US destroy 2 of our more progressive elected governments in the last 50 years (That we know of) ... they have tipped our typically left wing Labor party into a centre right party by whittling away at progressives. 

They fight and fund other parties against our true progressive parties (The Greens and the Socialist alliance.) 

And we are considered a ""friend of the US"" (utter bullshit, we are just willing patsies I know). You can imagine the shit they have pulled elsewhere in the world."

OFi73TzEN_8,good video but you absolutely butchered the Finnish surname the Alaskan representative has 😔
OFi73TzEN_8,"In a nutshell:

OFi73TzEN_8,Solidarity comment for the algorithm
OFi73TzEN_8,"Vote Third party. Vote Jill Stien. Campaign for them, or any third party. Give it a decade and see the change that came. 
Let the country be governed by the Republicans for a Decade. Thats what the Dems fear and fear monger about, but they implement the same policy.

Guess I must be a trendsetter after all."

OFi73TzEN_8,I don’t know who I hate more. Because Biden as most democrats tell us that he’d do all this good shit but goes and does the exact opposite. At least the republicans tell me to my face that they’re going to kill me.

OFi73TzEN_8,"I never really had the insights to justify my position on US politics, but this video speaks volume that my feeling has always been true. That it's a system only really catering capital interest; ""A capital dictatorship with the illusion of democracy"". The system in place is there to keep the status quo of capital power. And the lobbying would be regarded as ""corruption"" in other western nations."

OFi73TzEN_8,George Galloway called them two cheeks of the same arse.  I think that explains why the centrists are the worst.

I mean useful to working people. 100% of anything republican or conservative I've ever seen, after spending just a few extra minutes to check it out, have been nothing but hurt people. Thinking people don't generally latch onto gang-like behavior like republicans or conservatives or maga. This is why other parties don't seem very tough. There are people then there are republicans. Look at this asshole in this video-has nothing to say because his only purpose is to pretend to be a person but can only knock down others ideas to try and help us all."
OFi73TzEN_8,"You didn’t answer the question you posed though. Who are the people convincing candidates to become the opposing voters? Also, I would have loved a section on the courts striking down policies and dems being afraid of that when they make policies - how much does that contribute?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"You are such a whiner 😂 It feels really powerful when you get to cherry pick information and present it to your audience like you know what you’re talking about, doesn’t it?

Republicans ARE obstructionists! They, and Manchin and Sinema, ARE to blame for blocking progressive bills. Period.

Quit trying to twist information because Biden’s not progressive enough for you. The truth is, despite those conservative things he’s done that you mentioned, the Biden presidency has been the most progressive presidency of our lifetimes. You’d know that if you’d bother to pay attention to any of the actual successes instead of just the negatives.

Such a disservice to your viewers."

OFi73TzEN_8,"This is an appreciated perspective. Let's get one thing clear however that seems to be a lot of people are having some odd difficulty understanding, the right to your bodily autonomy is constitutional. It supercedes all state governments and federal government and courts. It's crucial everyone fully understand exactly what has happened and the colossal crime that has occurred against us. What has happened is the ""trickle down"" has orchestrated this whole fake ""life"" thing as an emotional manipulation to farm us as their property.

OFi73TzEN_8,The goal of both parties is to keep us believing the current system is for our benefit.
OFi73TzEN_8,"And you have to hear every four years “vote blue no matter who” “democrats are the reason why the Democratic Party fails”. Fuck me, if the Democratic Party was really concerned by the coming of fascism instead of running their stupid mouth about how this election has the soul of the nation at stake, maybe they should actually meet the requests (very basic stuff like not supporting a genocide) of the people that they want the vote of. Or they just keep blaming the people, saying that you didn’t vote hard enough, and just keep presenting the same type of candidate that is ensured to secure corporate sponsorship interests over the will of the people. America had it coming for a long time and praying people to give up their morals to meet your incredible low standards is not fair, you can’t always rely on how shitty your opponent is to win, this is how you kill a democracy and let the window shift ever so slowly to the right. Fascist is what America is and fascists are what America deserves, it has been asking for it for long."

Good to see you are still banging this drum."
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats would rather lose to a Republican than win with a progressive
OFi73TzEN_8,Wait? I thought managed democracy was about killing bugs and robots.
OFi73TzEN_8,It's true that they never get anything done if you ignore the things they get done.
OFi73TzEN_8,"The thing about blue dog Democrats is if that district wanted someone to vote with Republicans, they would have voted for the Republican.
If a district flips, it's because the voters wanted to try something different.  Instead, they get more of the same, which tells them voting doesn't matter."
OFi73TzEN_8,They're too busy filling their pockets.
OFi73TzEN_8,He promised to do more for the Social Security and Disability trusts and got many votes for that lie
OFi73TzEN_8,"One thing I disagree with here is the idea that Republicans have party solidarity figured out. It’s the same scare tactic they use against Dems, and the reality is the GOP wants the status quo just as much as the DNC does. They had plenty of chances to abolish the ACA, etc. and had control over the presidency, the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court for years. Winning an issue like abortion kills moderate support and removes a bogeyman to rile up prospective voters.

Why kill your connections with donors, lobbyists, party members, and corporations for a temporary radical change when you can use those connections to enrich your family for decades and engage in insider trading? No one ends up there who didn’t want power and money, and usually the allure is too much for those who make it past the initial funding/election filter. This may be especially true for working class candidates who see big money for the first time."

OFi73TzEN_8,"“You never lose if you play both sides”, i forget where I heard that from. Truly a fitting quote for what is otherwise dystopian society or at least one that is forming into one."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Much needed, informative video. Great work JT!
Cleared up so much to me as a foreigner about US politics. And Democracy INC. Is an amazing book. Its European counterpart is a book called ""The Ungovernable Society: A Genealogy of Authoritarian Liberalism"" by Grégoire Chamayou .. Talking about neoliberalism particularly as the root of duopoly and weak participation in politics as a result"
OFi73TzEN_8,We have a right wing party and an even more right wing party with both being exclusively controlled by wealthy business owners/landlords yet somehow americans will still blame the govt for everything without ever blaming a single business or landlord and call anything going wrong communism/socialism despite it literally being capitalism. Make it make sense.
OFi73TzEN_8,"I've been saying this for years. 
2008 election, Dems and Obama were singing their progressive hearts out to get elected. They won both houses and the presidency, and for the next 2 years, nothing. There was always some excuse. This is when people became fed up, and where the beginnings of MAGA reared its ugly head.
Dems lost big in 2010 but never took those lessons to heart. Let us hope they don't make the same mistakes when they decimate the Republicans in 2024.
Both parties kiss up to the same donors. It's dark money in American politics that is destroying the country."
OFi73TzEN_8,"So what im hearing is we need some direct democracy. A way to hold corrupt politicians accountable, overturn their decisions, and put the working class in the driver's seat"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Both sides of the coin are still following neoliberal reagonomics. We are not given a real choice, only an illusion of catharsis. The entire idea of an individual being able to represent the values of millions of people is inherently absurd. The most important positions of power on the planet are chosen through a popularity process based on vibes. The entire shitshow is deeply absurd. Voting is primarily there to facilitate catharsis to prevent organzied rebellions by making us feel like we have participated. All the while, politicians make decisions to please their donors. The rest is a theater. I suggest some sort of competition format that demonstrates general and political competence. The election process is worlds away from that, nothing in it is based on proving competence, only on generating the belief in that person's competence in enough people to win the vote, it's legit crazy. With the set of incentoves in that system, all someone has to do is lie convincingly. I really cannot beleive this is the best we have after so ling and the effprts of millions of minds. I am ashamed to be a human being, we are ridiculous."

They are PAID to NOT pass progressive legislation that actually makes things ( fair / equitable / sane ) for the bottom 99% of the population.
See ""Corporate Democrats"" for more . . . 
Which is why MONEY in politics needs to be abolished through a constitutional amendment.
And term limits need to be legislated as well.
And gerrymandering - vote suppression - the primary system in elections - and the electoral college need to be abolished as well.
AND ranked choice voting needs to be nationalized."

And this is the political reality of the empire that seeks to ""spread democracy and freedom"" globally LOL. Land of the free and home of the brave they say🤭

Also love how liberals in the US always say the same thing before _every_ nationwide or even statewide election: _Vote for the Democrats. The Republicans are worse!_ forgetting they say this _all the time_ and not some one-off tactical vote like in France recently. That's grifting and complicity at this point, and not just naivety"

OFi73TzEN_8,"11:51 I’m confused…. Her constituency IS conservative tho. It may be liberal Washington, but trust me, we have plenty of (largely) Republican districts, and Gluesenkamp’s is one of them — out of the last 18 presidential elections, they broke for the Republican candidate more than half the time. Like she didn’t just flip a red seat, she flipped a red seat that hadn’t been blue since 2008. So just saying, i wouldn’t exactly consider her the best example to illustrate this particular point."

Things like actual regulation and reform, DEFINITIVE LAWS AND ENFORCABLE POLICIES concerning the fucking REVOLVING DOOR policy which DC and Wallstreet have, AKA, the largest, most obvious breach and CONFLICT OF INTEREST we have ever seen, yet no one seems to give one fuck about it, and the way lobbying and political financing works (corruption), needs to be dealt with. It MUST be dealt with. Otherwise we will willfully, stupidly, just keep walking into a dystopian future which no average citizen has to endure. There will be a point where its too late (if its not already). Where the fuck are my angry, disgusted brothers and sisters out there? Wheres a pointed, detailed, sensible, CONSTITUTIONAL manifesto we can all get behind? I hate that this type of shit isnt THE main talking point in American public today!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to those policies. As is most of the population.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Great video, as always. I've got some third thoughts I'd like to share:
1. 11:50 G. Perez and the seat switching could be an interesting topic to explore. What are the dynamics of that and what's the intricacies of that in a two party system? Does it work to keep the congress evenly split?
2. 13:40 After the section here, it would have been a strong demonstration, if you showed the factor of public support for wether or not a bill gets past or not. As I remember it was very, very irrelvant.
3.  20:50 I would have found it interesting, to additionally ponder the scenario of what would happen, if the democrats actually had a clearer majority. My guess is, that the number of obstructionists would rise and there might be something like internal quabbles, shifting the center-gridlock-mechanic sorely into the democratic party, so that it won't be able to do, what would be in the benefit of the many, but not the capitalists. At which point would this mechanic seize functionality? Would it work the same with a republican majority?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Why Dems can’t get as much done as we want…

OFi73TzEN_8,Corporate lobbying should be illegal full stop.
OFi73TzEN_8,No they get a lot done. They said they support blm. This single handily defeated racism in America
OFi73TzEN_8,This video is fucking dumb.  Biden has had a wildly successful legislative agenda.  His approval rating sucks because he's old.  You just like to bash democrats.  Biden has been closer to Bernie than Obama.  Obama was too young without enough experience to govern effectively.  Biden may be old but he understands how to run government.  If progressives vote for democrats they get more progressive.  If they don't vote for democrats they move to the right.

OFi73TzEN_8,"We need something like ranked voting, as that way it would be possible to vote for a more preference candidate as a first choice and a candidate who’s more likely to beat the worst candidate as a second choice.  Right now the options are voting exclusively for the lesser evil or throwing ones vote away and letting the worst evil win."
OFi73TzEN_8,"I always thought the Black Lives Matter movement would’ve been a perfect springboard for a third-party. At first, I don’t know why anyone didn’t think of it but then when I realized it was a big scam made sense."
OFi73TzEN_8,"I know there’s a lot of truth to this. But my experience is the specific difference democrats want to spread the money around a little bit more than Republicans.  Biden’s infrastructure plan was a good idea and many of the Republicans that benefited from it voted against it. How is that even right?  There are no consequences voting against your own constituents anymore.

Republicans want to cut taxes, cut social programs and then give themselves tax breaks and pat themselves on the back"
OFi73TzEN_8,Lobbying is the root of all evil in America. How could you call US a democracy when a small group of people control the government?
OFi73TzEN_8,Babe wake up second thought posted
OFi73TzEN_8,"Yeah!  Spreading Managed Democracy to the gal

wait"
OFi73TzEN_8,"And call other countries corrupt,  lobbying = corruption"
OFi73TzEN_8,The  ACA used Heritage Foundation framework so we still loose.
OFi73TzEN_8,"The problem with the US is being a giant corporate bordello. The system is so biased and so corrupt, even the most popular ""not rightwing"" politicians don't get too far. It's by either giant corporation owned mainstream media, corporate funded candidates, corporate owned everything. And ordinary people who were born and raised in this system with ""we're the biggest, baddest bla bla bla"" propaganda can't phatom anything else.
Do 1000 people own more than the rest of the country? YES! (GDP per Capita is around 75k but it drops to 35k if the top 1000 removed)
Are you the only developed country without a social security? YES! (Seriously, even backward countries have it nowadays)
Do you have to work to death so your corporate masters can buy a 300ft yacht? YES! (How many jobs does an average American work and how many hours does an ordinary American work per week)
Do you think everybody on earth wants to live in your country? YES! (Only those stuck in backward dictatorships without any other option do that)

Somehow anyone who criticise US politics and state of affairs labeled as traitor. They might also commit suicide with two shots to the head, like Gary Webb, revealed Iran-Contra affair of the CIA.
And to be honest, ordinary people (not just Americans) are so frustrating. Take Gary Webb. Holywood literally made a movie (Kill the Messenger) out of him, yet most of you guys still have no idea what's going on with the American Federal Government. I mean, do we have to make a pill out of it and shove it down your throats to make you realise what the F is going on?!"

OFi73TzEN_8,"Because pressure from OUTSIDE the political system mobilizes change.  

…and the pressure ordinary people are able/willing to use is always smaller, more dangerous to themselves, and most effective in mass-coordination.  

Something that can largely be replaced by just having money and paying people… you know.  The thing rich people and corporations have.  And use.  And then have more of.  

So on and so forth."

OFi73TzEN_8,"We're constantly warned of the risk of duopoly in keeping prices high, that we need to break these up. Applies to government too.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Congradualations. You've figured out the power of money (as well as risk reduction behavior) in politics. You don't mention the Dems main competitor, the Republicans- who also don't deliver. Kennedy, Williams, et al won't deliver because they don't have money ( and plenty of other reasons). Some of this stuff is legitimate as the proposed means  to achieve  the end is not agreeable to all parties. But- money, is the power that prevents many proposals which would probably reduce their profits and power and improve most people. I could pretty easily rebrand No Labels with the symbol $."
OFi73TzEN_8,Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor
OFi73TzEN_8,"Is this why David Pakman in America and A different Bias in the UK never talk about their favoured Partys when they win? Pakman spent every waking hour holding his Government to account when Trump was in power but only talked about Trump when Biden was in power.  A Different Bias (UK channel) only held Tory Governmnet to account when they were in power, but only talks about Tories now Labour is in power.

Could it be because it's really difficult to spin centrist BS?"
OFi73TzEN_8,So we need to work together as progressives to primary non-progressive/centrist Dems and work our butts off to get those progressive elected. I'm all for it!

The amount of money being thrown around is, while large to the ordinary people,  tiny for a 'philanthropic billionaire '.

OFi73TzEN_8,"In order to survive in (at least US) politics, you need obscene amounts of money. No matter how much you can raise from the grassroots, you’ll eventually need to ask the rich for money. In order to get money from the rich, the party that’s sympathetic to the population has to asset that they’re in no way a threat to the rich or their interests, and that all they want is a stable economy that works for everyone and sees everyone’s lot improve.

This is why the Democrats can’t come out and act like the party of the people, because the ENTIRE business community will line up behind the party of the ruling class (the GOP) to smash the Dems, just to teach the plebs a lesson. The fact that the Republicans are the party of the ruling class and are solely dedicated to centralizing as much wealth as possible into the hands of the rich and powerful means they have the leeway to pretend to be the party of rural, “working class” hillbillys who’re doing battle against “the elites” (I.e. universities, labor unions, the LGBT community, migrants, homeless people, people under 50, “urban” Americans, etc.) 

To survive, the Dems (despite being the party that’s sympathetic to the American population) have to present themselves as the party that’s dedicated to conserving American institutions, even during a time when said institutions have lost all credibility amongst the American public. The elites have the GOP in their pocket, so the Republicans can pretend to be some populist insurgency doing battle with the very ruling class they’re in total service to."
OFi73TzEN_8,Go out and vote everyone
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Presidential system is the worst form of government that exists in democracies. It's been criticized even in the country where it's been most successful: the US. The General who started the 1964 military coup in Brazil had a postumous book published before the end of the regime - and it complained about how the regime destroyed our democracy and he also complained about the Presidential System. He said wrote that according to his point of view 'the Brazilian politics deficiencies, before or after the 1964 coup, don't result only to the succession of military rulers or to their personal definiciencies while in power but also and mainly to the Presidential System that, by putting a huge bungle of powers  in the hands of  the president, ""make the Executive into a greater power and annihilates the independence of the other two powers [legislative and judiciary], disrupting the [republican] harmony.""'

Source: Atlas of Brazilian History, Getúlio Vargas Foundation. Original excerpt taken from the entry  ""Olympio Mourão Filho"":  ""A seu ver, os males da política brasileira, antes ou depois de 1964, não se deveram somente à sucessão de militares no poder ou às suas deficiências pessoais enquanto governantes, mas ao próprio sistema presidencialista que, enfeixando nas mãos do presidente uma grande soma de poderes, “transforma o Executivo em poder maior e anula a independência dos outros dois, perturbando a harmonia”.

Gen. Mourão played important roles during the 20th century politics in Brazil. He was the person who started the 1964 coup by ordering his troops to position around the presidential palace in Rio de Janeiro. A less nown fact is that in 1966 he publicly and loudly voiced his complaints about the cancelation of the presidential election scheduled to happen during that same year. I won't go further but it's important to know that  the Brazilian Armed Forces (and, afaik, that is true for all Latin American countries) has never been a monolithic institution and already before the republic it's had to major factions that are now called the ""Hardliners"" on one side and the ""Liberals"", ""Legalists"", ""Castellists"" or ""Members of the Sorbonne"" - referencing the French university. The term used nowadays for the Liberals is ""Castellists"" - a reference to the first General to rule after the 1964 coup, Gen. Castello Branco. Though Gen. Mourão was somewhat independent he sided, philosophically, with the Castellists and his complaint about the suspended elections was aimed not at Gen. Castello Branco but at the Hardliners - he knew what was behind Castello's decision. 

I got the quote from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, FGV, that houses the Center for Reseach and Documentation of Brazil's Contemporary History (CPDOC), bears the name of a General, Getúlio Vargas, who was the bloodiest and most ruthless dicator in Brazil's history (1937-1945). He also created institutions for Geographical and Economic research, institutions to fund scientific research, the national oil company Petrobrás, the steelworks company CSN and the mining company Vale S/A - these last two with important aid from the US under Franklin Roosevelt. Most importantly, he created the institutions needed for a real democracy: the Electoral Tribunal and a secret voting system. Vargas would later become an elected president in 1950 and under fierce opposition that started to create a real risk of civil war he killed himself - saving Brazilians from the civil war, destroying his oppositions and enter History. 

I often do this long comments about these guys because I like talking about them. I find the most important lesson someone who is not from Brazil can get is how complicated power is, how hard it is to build a democratic nation and how easily even the best intentions can cause democracy to slide back so quickly. I often read comments blaming Trump for the crisis of American democracy; some do a better work and go back to the 2008 economic crash. A few, like Michael Sandel saw furthen in time by being able to see the potential of the existing problems to grow already in 1996. Then I found a PBS video essay aired as a two part Fronline special called ""The Betrayal of Democracy"" that aired in 1992 before the elections. IMHO, the origins of the current crisis on American democracy are in the CIA's coup that removed Árbenz from power in Guatemala. That's the first time the US moves it's muscle not in its own interest but in the interest of the a private bu9siness: The American Fruit Company and the banks who funded it. Others like Stephen Kizner put it all the way back into the 19th century - more precisely in 1989 and the Congressional Debates that started during that year about how to deal with newly acquired territories like Hawaii and the Philippines and if/how the US Constitution applied to US actions outside the US territory. They concluded that the Constitution applied only within the US borders but not outside it nor in American territories - and that's why to this day the inhabitants of Puerto Rico and Guam don't have the right to vote."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Those moderates tip the scales because their constituencies are expecting them to be moderate. Not every single geographic area is as progressive as the big cities. And many of them only win because they are moderate enough to win other people who would otherwise just vote Republican. Political science says our type of political society just naturally converges towards two major center parties, one to the right and one to the left. You can be dissatisfied with the Democrats. And if it’s that big of a deal, then fine. Don’t vote for them. But I promise you: if you didn’t like the Democrats, I surely believe you **really** won’t like Republicans when they win. Because they will if not the Democrats. Fantasies of a third party bucking the odds are just fantasies because Duverger’s law will always hold. You have to accept the framework as it is. Change the party from within. But also be prepared to accept the limitation and reality that most voters really are pretty centrist or moderate. And given a society as vast and demographically diverse as ours is, with all kinds of stakeholders and competing factions and priorities, convergence to a center should not surprise anyone.

And yeah: splits in the house and senate matter a lot. He can’t deliver if he doesn’t have Congress together on board to make it work. He gets so much blame but it’s really Congress’s lack of unity and divisiveness that was the issue. He tried to negotiate and get some Republicans on side and that’s what a president is supposed to do. Reach across the aisle. Bipartisanship matters. Because that’s the only real way legislation stays in the long term. If you just push things in a partisan faction, the other side will campaign against it and repeal it when they get back in charge."

OFi73TzEN_8,"I need to review your video a second time.  But upon first review, I get the sense there is little or no function in the Democratic party that insures all members are aligned to a progressive, system changing plan.  Therefore, it seems a cheaper method is just appear progressive, without taking the risks.  Accordingly, blockers of any progressive change are tolerated, because really no one in that political landscape is committed anyways.  Further, it is much less expensive for right oriented billionaires to fund a few people who will block any progressive appearing. changes  Why pay more when you don't have to?  With votes being close, that is all that is necessary."
OFi73TzEN_8,I unfortunately voted for Perez cause she did a good job of representing as blue. I won’t vote for her again.
OFi73TzEN_8,Great reminder. I've been feeling relieved since JB dropped for KH - purely because I think more people will vote for her - but it's important not to forget that this is a puppet show we're watching.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Uhhh, shit was getting done until Republicans took the house. Now it's the least productive Congress in History."
OFi73TzEN_8,"For context, right-wing cults and organizations have spent the past few decades paying for propaganda to portray lgbt people as a religious/political ideology.
The members of their cult and those who fall for their indoctrination genuinely believe that trans people don't exist... that gay people don't exist, that lesbians don't exist, that bisexual people don't exist, that intersex people don't exist, that asexual people don't exist... etc.

Despite extensive and conclusive evidence that all these people are real, and do in fact exist... and are simply a natural part of the broad spectrum of humanity.

It's a bit like the flat-earth cult convincing people that the earth isn't round, because it keeps them engaging with and giving money to the flat-earth cult.

In cult psychology, you do this to control the perception and exposure of those you wish to exploit.

For example, pretend you run one of those flat-earth clubs with membership fees and merchandise... you can't disprove all the concrete evidence that the earth is round, and if your cult members learn about our solar system they'll realize you're a fraud and stop giving you money.
So you don't show them the evidence and disprove it, you tell them that the evidence is made up so that you can claim you don't have to disprove it... the earth isn't 'round', that's just a made up ideology by big globe tech or a fake religion made up by the big globe illuminati.

Now if that cult members sees a working model of the solar system, they won't think - 'Oh cool what's that? How does our planet work?' like a normal person and learn about it... that cult member will see the solar system and subconsciously dismiss it and think 'Oh I know everything about that! That's a fake made up scam ideology!' ...and learn nothing about it.

Controlling a person's perception and experience in this manner keeps them ignorant and easy to manipulate... and keeps them coming back and buying your flat-earth cult T-shirts.

The same principles are used by bigoted political and religious cults against lgbt+ people to dehumanize and invalidate their existence.
Such organizations can't disprove the overwhelming substantive evidence for trans peoples' existence, nor do they wish to allow their members to learn anything about trans people.
Instead they falsely advertise and misrepresent it as 'trans ideology' and 'trans activism' or 'woke ideology' and 'gender ideology'... which just like the flat-earth cult, keeps their victims ignorant and easy to manipulate.

So now like you see here, they don't say 'Oh? What's a trans person?' nor learn anything about reality...
...they say 'I know everything about this! Why are you forcing this made up religious ideology on me!?'.

Because they are under the delusion that trans people aren't real, and that everyone merely 'believes' they're real... as if we're believing the tooth-fairy is real and activists are forcing them to put their teeth under our pillows for us.

Once you've convinced all these victims to believe in such a delusion, that the evil tooth fairy activists are coming for their teeth and their wife's teeth and their children's teeth... you can then tell them you're 'anti tooth-fairy', you're 'anti-fairy', you're against the 'woke teeth agender'...

...and you need good honest noble heroes to give you money and vote for you so that you can finally stop the evil globalist tooth-fairy 1984 apocalypse that's definitely happening right now!

This is why such hysteria exists around these subjects.
The same type of propaganda manipulation was used against women in the 1930's.
Then against working class people in the 1950's.
Then against black people in the 1960's-70's.
Then against gay people in the 1980's.
Then against atheists.
Then against muslims.
Then against bisexuals.
Then against young generations.
Then against migrants.
Etc. etc. etc...

I know this is a fairly long read, but if you understand it please copy and share it so that more people are aware and have a better chance of protecting themselves from exploitation.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Good video, JT. I'd add that, structurally, the economy depends on keeping the investor class happy. Even if we managed to get dozens of Bernies and Rashidas into Congress, there are limits on what they could effectively do without investors taking money out of the U.S., or even manufacturing a recession. In some countries, there are outright capital strikes when progressive-to-left politicians attempt good things. Under capitalism, just because investors are happy doesn't mean the people are, but if the investor class is unhappy, the people will definitely be unhappy. Our well-being depends on their willingness to invest.

I liked at the end when you pointed to public organization. Reforms come through overwhelming public pressure. If unions can organize a real general strike in 2028, that'll be a game changer. Even then, it'll always be an uphill battle for every reform until there's enough class consciousness to talk about something beyond reform."

Both have the same economic interests and foreign policies. They work for the corporations, not us. Funny how when the Democrats have control over the Presidency, House and Senate that progressive policies never get enacted or are greatly watered down because of a few conservative Dems.  It happens EVERY SINGLE TIME.! Personally I am sick to death of it. It's a joke. Thank you for pointing out why this happens."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Dang, unfortunate timing"
OFi73TzEN_8,"As a minor point, the whole ""public option"" suggestion back when the ACA was being debated was pure theater.  The name escapes me but a former executive for one of the major healthcare insurance companies admitted that the public option was meant to keep the single-payer talks at bay while providing said companies a means to dump their more costly customers onto the public dollar so they can keep the healthier customers buying in.  And because it still would've relied on the for-profit healthcare system, the public option would've meant that the government had to shell out more money to cover said people (assuming that the funding for said public option would even get what it needed from Republicans)."
OFi73TzEN_8,"What I hate is that we have people who seem to think that Kamala Harris is any better. 

She was a part of Biden's administration, and she stood by all this. She was even put in charge of the border by the man himself. But all of a sudden, the media says she wasn't, and she's being artificially installed. I understand that she is the incumbent and all... but there still should be a primary of some sort... 

Also, she has a horrible record as a California prosecutor. Since when is that presidential metarial?  But then again, we have a felon as the republican nominee, so what do I know...


All I gotta say is, prosecutor vs. felon for the presidency is something I never thought I would ever see."
OFi73TzEN_8,"If Dems actually followed through on their progressive politics, Reps wouldn't win a single election ever again. The Republican party is already unpopular which is why they resort to undemocratic and facist ideology which helps them retain power. Democrats are the do nothing party because they always rely on the old ""we are bad but the other guy is worse"" campaign strategy. All it takes is one person like Donald Trump but for the Democratic party to turn the party around and make true progress. But that's just wishful thinking at this point."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Bro I get lambasted online for spouting this for years, but the Dems and Repubs are two sides of the same plutocratic-establishment coin! But then I get told I should vote for the people who are nice with their f-ing-over rather than the party that yells and wears bandaids about it, like c'mon..."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Except that it largely does. Look at your initial examples. Protection for abortion? Existing protection overturned by SCotUS. Student loan relief? Again, overturned by SCotUS. And the GOP agenda is deliberately obstructionist (they were given a clean border bill, that was bipartisan, and at Trump's urging they voted it down).

But Democrats *have* gotten a lot through despite that. The ACA, which was softened to get GOP support, got through despite not a single GOP vote. The inflation reduction at went through. Student loan relief did go through (and then was killed by the courts). 

Your entire narrative is founded on a false principle.

But I wonder if accusation isn't admission. I've long asserted that the GOP doesn't want reduced gun violence because the fear of it sells guns. They don't want to solve immigration, because it's a platform. I don't think they wanted to stop abortion either (gods know it's really given them a shellacking at the ballot box); because anger at abortion drove votes. 

I think your statement is true; but I think you have the wrong party."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Guys not to burst anyone's bubble, but as someone who works in the energy sector (HVAC) it is physically impossible to outlaw fossil fuels. Our power grid is still way too dependent on them and to expand it would only mean more fossil fuel consumption. This is objectively true. Even if we went all electric that simply means burning more coal anyways. Wind and solar merely do not produce enough to satisfy our energy consumption. Unless we are all willing to turn our lights and computers off, fossil fuels are an outright necessity until better forms of energy are invented"

OFi73TzEN_8,"It's great and all that you are point out these issues with the democrats, but this video ultimately solves nothing when there are no solutions proposed.

OFi73TzEN_8,"…before I get started, is this just more doomerism about how voting in the US doesn’t matter? Bc I’m getting really, really tired of that tbqh."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Unfortunately the only organized masses are on the right. Sadly they’re being duped by fascists, or at least faux populists, so they probably will wind up pulling social issues to the right while foreign and economic policies remain largely the same.

From the 84 million people living in Germany, there are about 1000 ""transgender"", something between male and female or whatever you want to call it. These 1000 people is telling the rest of the country how to talk, how to act, how to smile, how to joke, how to... everything. Very democratic! All the while the whole ""government"" is pocketing more and more tax money. Just look at Ursula von der Leyen. Even her name is a damage to society. She created so much hate against herself in Germany that Angela Merkel forcibly needed to push her to Belgium. Now she is destroying whole Europe. Thats democracy these days. Thats politics. Just destroy everything and everyone that doesnt match your opinion while you make yourself richer and richer. In the meantime you get protected by some government agency, which is payed with tax payers money, so that you can't even smell the consequences of what you are doing. Jesus Christ...

Corporate capitalist overlords are a thing, yes, but when did we forget that this is a supposed to be a democracy and that there needs to be compromise in order for ANYTHING to get done? It means you can't have it all your way; you need to give up some stuff to gain something else. You talk about socialism as economy by democracy; yes, I agree, I'd prefer more; everyone but the capitalists would. But, it's not the system. Gotta work within it to change it. I've a BA in political philosophy, I've done plenty of research too and yes, the system is corrupted, but at least the Democrats are trying to change some things.

The last times we had progress in this country was when the dems had the racists behind them in their racist corner, and the republicans had the 'radical' and 'centrist' internal rule competing, or when the democrats successfully kicked the ethno-nationalist out, and we had a proper competing 2 parties until Nixon/Raegan invited the ethno-nationalist back in, and effectively/eventually lead this nation to a standstill. It is a lot easier for corporate instances to strangle this country while an ethno-national divide exists. and rendering this divide moot is a pre-requisite not just for liberal policy advancement, but any real political advancement. Last time it took the democrats 50+ years to abandon ethno nationalism after the civil war. Voting dem, like it or not, is effectively the only option until the GOP is politically irrelevant, or abandons ethno-nationalism. Only then can real policies, change, can realistically be pushed.

OFi73TzEN_8,"A few weeks ago I came across a clip from The Simpsons. It was an illustration of both political parties with a few signs and banners over them. For The Republican Party, a banner said, “WE’RE JUST EVIL!” For the Democratic Party, their banner said, “WE CAN’T GOVERN!” That episode looked like it was from the early 1990s, right around the time the democrats embraced the Third Way. More than lobbying, more should be educating people on how this political philosophy operates in modern American liberalism."

OFi73TzEN_8,"President Biden, with support from Democrats in Congress, is one of the most productive presidents in recent history, comparable to FDR.

OFi73TzEN_8,"That 'nearly equal divisions' quote is on the nail.

I'm in the UK, and pushing 70, and I just don't get how all major issues seem split down the middle nowadays. 

Brexit just scraped in, yet a year before no-one (apart from some extremists) even thought about EU membership. Every election in the USA seems to be too close to call, ever since George W's 'hanging chads'. France has just avoided a quite Right-leaning government by a few percentage points.

When I was younger, there seemed to be a national 'mood', and people went with it. Now societies have divided themselves down the middle on a load of major issues. I don't get how everything is 50/50 - it feels fishy, tbh.

Please don't think I want 'my' side to win, and the others to disappear! If people wanted Brexit, fine. That's democracy. But why wasn't it 60% or 70% of votes? 52% is so close - it seems almost designed to cause division and anger when a few percentage points can change society so much.

Of course, the fact our new government has a massive majority on just 20% of those able to vote (34% of actual votes cast. So 66% of votes cast were for other parties) is a bit of a disgrace too. Even though the Tories were obnoxious and needed to go."

OFi73TzEN_8,"Another reason is that they can keep moving the goalpost using progressive objectives to campaign and the do nothing and use those same objectives their next campaign. That's why they never codified Roe v Wade. They could keep telling people ""if you want to protect reproductive rights you better vote us"". And now it's even better for them because they can say ""we had all the intention of doing ir but the supreme court blocked us. Vote for us so we can change the supreme court for our side"" but they would just replace a judge with a pro corporate judge who doesn't really give a flying fuck about reproductive rights."

2. Full on corporate welfare via tax cuts, union busting and more.

3. Supports Netanyahu's plan to escalate the war in Gaza in order to postpone Isreal's elections.

4. ""One state solution"" which incorporates all Palestinian land into Israel, which will lead to full scale apartheid.

5. Ending the war in Ukraine by cutting military aid and letting Putin win.

6. Last but not the least implementing ""Project 2025"" aka the unitary executive theory which makes the president essentially a king.


Nothing to say about voting rights, police brutality and full on nazification of half of America, making life miserable for African-Americans, LGBTQ community, immigrants, refugees, poor people through cash bail and so on.

A bunch of folks want to create ads for Kamala Harris (because MAGA cannot rise) but the more I listened to them, the more I immersed myself in the reality of what she is and what I would have to do to convince people.... well it reminded me why advertising/ marketing is as much a part of the capitalist weaponry against truth, justice and liberty as any cop with a truncheon or any AIPAC owned politician. 

That said: I am still thinking about an ad for Kamala and the democrats but this time, I'm approaching it with the hopes of laying a ""manchurian"" seed of an idea in the middle, a thing that sits and sounds like obvious political democratic talk but worms its way into the thinking, producing a more astute and critical populace.

Nor did you mention any of the historical legislation that Biden and the democrats DID accomplish, like the infrastructure bill that is currently busy actually repairing roads and bridges and other types of infrastructure in about 20,000 projects across the nation. The chips act brought computer chip manufacturing back to the US after Trump had failed to bring a single manufacturing job back to the US during his four years in office.

The right are obviously regressive and oppressive and the left are obviously for the working class. It's the centrists who represent the neoliberal status quo by confusing the masses through politics, big business, mainstream media, and think tanks have managed to fool the left and right into blaming each other for the problems of the world and have managed to turn the working class to the right with the assumption that the cancel culture elites are the left when it's the centrists who are to blame for everything. Its time for the left and right to finally vote out the centrists and then let the left and right campaign for who will finally take power with no confusion, hopefully the working class will wise up some day."

OFi73TzEN_8,Something smells like a secret Republican transplant. Especially taking into account their states and interests they represent.

OFi73TzEN_8,"This is happening in the UK with the Labour Party. They have managed to eject the majority of genuine socialists from the party and are in the process of silencing the ones who remain.

OFi73TzEN_8,"Ok... So I have enjoyed second thought, as I've always seen it as evidence based but for you to equate 48 senators+ Joe Man him & Sinema to a blue Senate and having a 10 person (20 count differential) in the house as swinging blue. And that Biden had runway for two years is grossly misleading."

Democrats and Republicans are two heads of the same coin and we've been gridlocked as a nation for over 30 years. This ""status quo"" must serve someone. You've laid it out nicely why this benefits the political apparatus, both democrats and republicans. Ultimately at the end of the day, its for the benefit of corporations. This has to come to and end, but it would require politics to kick out money and enact legislation to make sure past politicians and their family can in no way benefit from their past work, campaign financing would have to be remade to disallow corporate money AND people would have to come together and get on board with a plan of action for progressive legislation"

Some things that you want require not just a majority but an overwhelming majoriry and that doesn't happen unless you have enough blue that they're safe to push through progressive agenda. 

  You need an overwhelming blue majoriity in every level of your government to push your agenda and you all keep voting red whenever you don't get your way. It doesn't make sense, but you do it.

You need landslide victories or they will need to centrify their policies to pick up enough votes in the house and senate to get ANYTHING pushed through."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Oligarchy, corporatocracy, stratocracy, bureaucracy, gerontocracy, kleptocracy, and kakistocracy but definitely no democracy in sight. This is why I can't be invested in this charade.

OFi73TzEN_8,"i already knew this, but i never knew how systematic it really was"
OFi73TzEN_8,"The biggest lie the American public believe is the weaponized adjectives of “Democracy.” 

It’s used in their narrative of having a moral high ground compared to other countries in the world despite the U.S. not even ranking in the top 10 for “Democracy” 

The military industrial complex and dark money interests own this country. It’s what the U.S. accuses for example Russians and their oligarchs. To play into this narrative of democracy, once they’ve made their selection, the American public gets to “vote” for one of the two selected members. Then to make sure the American public is distracted, they turn up the heat on differences between the democrats and republicans such as identity politics to keep them busy despite the fact that the two parties are two cheeks of the same ass. 

It’s so convoluted and nuanced that most don’t care and don’t know where to start learning and understand this system, so they default to who they think holds credibility on the subject. Meanwhile those very individuals or agencies are the very entities keeping you lost in the hamster wheel that is American propaganda."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Republican party is the best without any problems unlike democrats, They should be voted more often"
OFi73TzEN_8,"The idea is to lean out the system, to make it more efficient. While the republicans set the tone and direction, the democrats provide the breathing room in between the decision making periods. People don't like the idea of taking their civil rights away, or constantly diminishing their living standards for more profit gains. But, in a capitalist system, that has to happen to keep the competitive edge. That's why in democratic system there's two or more ""parties"", to give the voters the illusion of choice. When they have had enough of ""reform"" they vote for the seemingly more ""humane"" option, when they are ready to get tortured again, they vote for the less ""humane"" option, to develop capitalism.

You won't ever truly understand the system, until you realize it's all a giant scam. A political theater to make you believe you have a choice. Bcz if you think you are part of the ""free world"", you tend to defend that dream more vigorously than you would if you thought you were part of a tyranny. That is what they figured out a hundred years ago. Ever since, they have tried to mask that tyranny under a ""democracy""."

OFi73TzEN_8,It's not Biden's fault he didn't do anything he promised to. He just didn't remember. :)
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Democrats were a force for change in the 1930s. Since the 1990s, they have been more conservative than Eisenhower."
OFi73TzEN_8,We need border rules to eliminate competition for a job market
OFi73TzEN_8,Democrats represent mos of working people in America in the sense they go to their jobs to do the bare mininum amount of work not to get fired...
OFi73TzEN_8,Nothing but.... HUGE profits
OFi73TzEN_8,Insightful as always. I always learn something from your videos! ❤❤❤
OFi73TzEN_8,"thanks for confirming my thought that, ""our congress are bought by corporations, and serve them as opposed to the people""

it's like we should disallow lobbying or something"
OFi73TzEN_8,The fact that lobbying is still an issue decades later (I remember first hearing about how much it's affected democracy as a whole back in 3rd grade) is crazy to me. Just another addition to the list of things we knew were dangerous/horrible decades ago but have done nothing about.
OFi73TzEN_8,It's the dictatorship of capital. That's the reason. Only things that pass are pro capitalist. Only people elected are also.
OFi73TzEN_8,Neither political party gets anything done because the status quo is in the best interest of both parties. We have a uniparty for all intents and purposes
OFi73TzEN_8,"a bit outside the scope of this video, but it’s worth mentioning that a legislature which is deadlocked by design gives essentially unaccountable power to the executive and the judiciary — essentially, a semi elected aristocracy which serves as the perfect vehicle of elite power."
OFi73TzEN_8,Dude your content has been so influential for helping me change the minds of some of my friends that were still being skewed by big media. It's really nice having somebody  point out society's real issues like this.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Rest of the world: Bribery👹
US of A: Lobbying 😇"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Everything our government does is useless virtue signaling. They say they're for X but when they have the opportunity to do X, one asshole holdout predictably tanks the whole thing, but they can always go back and say ""well I still really support X so keep voting for me"" and nothing ever gets done. Wash rinse repeat. Big club, you ain't in it."
OFi73TzEN_8,America’s two political parties: Republican and Republican Lite
OFi73TzEN_8,I used to get duped by the democrats but I stopped believing they are progressive in any way. They are not!
OFi73TzEN_8,"Both have been BRIBED by the same conflicts of interest ,and this way it makes it look like Republicans are important . Otherwise Republicans would have a problem getting elected they always do ."
OFi73TzEN_8,Why are you talking about Biden as if he is still the democratic nominee even though he already dropped out?
OFi73TzEN_8,"The democrats can freely slide to the right because the liberal base and self-proclaimed ""progressives"" refuse to hold them accountable. With unconditional support (vote-blue-no-matter-who, and ""most important election of our lifetime"") you get a democratic party that only cares about chasing after right-wing voters. Their policies and values will continue to slide farther and farther to the right, which consequently gives republicans the freedom to move *even farther* to the right of the democrats. Until and unless democratic voters, and left-wing voters put their collective foot down and say ""you've gone too far"", things will continue to worsen, and they'll have no one to blame but themselves."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Enlighting. Good work, Second Thought."
OFi73TzEN_8,creative director went bonkers mode on this one (looks very good!!!!!)
OFi73TzEN_8,fuckin tankies
OFi73TzEN_8,"Corruption should be illegal, ban lobbying please..."
OFi73TzEN_8,"In other words, bourgeois democracy is a dictatorship of the rich."
OFi73TzEN_8,I used to like your stuff years ago but now your just another commie hanging out with tankies
OFi73TzEN_8,"Vice President Kamala Harris is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, but your point still rings true."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The long arc of human history curves towards justice. But for the last few decades we've been going backwards in many ways. Don't give up hope, keep fighting and progress will resume."
OFi73TzEN_8,"I mean if you have to decide between staying in power and getting things done, well you're kinda stuck.  Unfortunately the system will punish parties who want to do good because they won't have the funds to get ahead. Tbh, I'm not surprised but it's the best we have with the current system. I'd rather choose the party that get things done slowly over the party that passes laws that are awful"
OFi73TzEN_8,Nope.
OFi73TzEN_8,"I suspect we have a lot of DIMO's (Democrats In Name Only) largely for the same reason RINO's exist: the party they *wanted* to be in didn't have room for them in a particular state, so they switched to a different party in order to have a shot at a seat at the table. We see this pretty badly in FL. FL doesn't really have a Democratic party here, just Rejected Republicans. Conservatives who wouldn't be out of place in an RNC back in the 1990's make up FL's Democratic candidates, and unsurprisingly, very few of them end up elected to anything."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Dude, What are you talking about JT. They done something







Pissing off the people who want them to do something."
OFi73TzEN_8,I’d say I’m a more left leaning republican. I rly enjoy ur videos bro. I’ll barely be 18 by the time of the election but I’m excited to vote. Even tho I disagree with some of what u say i feel like ur a rly good source for learning. I appreciate the content.
OFi73TzEN_8,Thanks for this VERY timely post. I’ve been too far down the rabbit hole lately…!
OFi73TzEN_8,im always one of the first to watch these videos. love the work you're doing dude!
OFi73TzEN_8,Unfortunately this has become the norm in many countries.
OFi73TzEN_8,We need to establish a real left leaning party.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Part of thing that makes everything frustrating is that while Republicans ARE obstructing the promises biden made, the democrats act like just trying to get something done is the same as getting it done. They're only marginally better than trump and the Republicans bc they're so far right it makes denocratic centerism look like socialism. It's not that some democrats don't want to pass progressive polices. It's that when they have power, they don't do ENOUGH.
Democrat desperately scramble for some sense of civility that just isn't possible anymore with the way alt-right talking heads and trump just say whatever they want. The system just does not work."
OFi73TzEN_8,"As far as this PROJECT 2025 fear mongering goes, the Republicans have been trying to do this dumb shit for 40 YEARS now and the corporate owned Dems have ENABLED it election cycle after election cycle.

OBAMA ran on codifying Roe v Wade (The Freedom of Choice Act) and abandoned it after he was elected EVEN THOUGH HE HAD A SUPERMAJORITY.

OBAMA ran on ending the Patriot Act and instead broadened the scope of its power.

OBAMA ran on giving us Universal Healthcare and instead gave us a for profit healthcare scam written by THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION.

BIDEN wrote the most racist crime bill in modern history.

THE CLINTON CRIME BILL jailed so many minorities it gave rise to the private prison industry.

CLINTON also signed NAFTA which killed the manufacturing base of this country and gutted unions.

CLINTON passed cruel welfare reform which hurt those already in need.

CLINTON also supported DOMA (The anti-gay Defense Of Marriage Act)

BIDEN said he would veto Medicare For All if it came across his desk. He said this in the middle of a pandemic.
 
BIDEN ran on a $15 min wage and abandoned it.

BIDEN ran on a $2000 stimulus and didn’t follow through.

BIDEN wrote the predecessor to the Patriot Act.

BIDEN fought to make abortion a STATES RIGHTS ISSUE.

BIDEN supported NAFTA.

BIDEN commended and supported the Bush Administration invading Iraq.

So excuse me if I am not hiding under my desk in fear from this bullshit conservative fan fiction that the corporate owned Dems have done nothing to stop or even slow in the last 4 decades.

It's all being pumped up to take the focus off the fact THAT JOE BIDEN IS IN COGNITIVE DECLINE.

BIDEN was a useless right wing bootlicker before he lost his mind and the only reason he is president to start out with is because the DNC rigged the primary for him.

And now we have Kamala who has been anointed as the candidate with no primary at all.

She’s a crooked cop, authoritarian, Zionist, who was EVEN MORE UNPOPULAR than Biden in the 2020 primary!

So this pearl clutching about “protecting democracy” means NOTHING coming from the Dems who have rigged the last 3 primaries.

https://youtu.be/rinLLham9gk?si=hGV0Rs1aFfVTDc4Z"
OFi73TzEN_8,They are paid not to
OFi73TzEN_8,Another great video JT! I’m always amazed by the work you put into them. It’s time for me to join the Patreon.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Stop calling it ""lobbying"". Call it what it actually is ""BRIBERY""."
OFi73TzEN_8,why dont syndicates or masses of people unite and pool their money to B̶r̶i̶b̶e̶   do lobbying so politicians instate progressive reforms?
OFi73TzEN_8,God I'm so happy I left the US. I wish I could renounce my citizenship so much.
OFi73TzEN_8,The cards are stacked against improvements for the workers and the poor.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Keir Starmer's not as effective at doing the bare minimum as Tony Blair, and it's going to come back to haunt New New Labour and their benefactors.

Also, Bowman was the incumbent and Latimer was the challenger."
OFi73TzEN_8,Managed democracy got a chuckle out of me
OFi73TzEN_8,JT this was a good video. But the whole time I was watching. I kept thinking what’s the solution? I been following your videos since maybe around the 2020 election. And it’s great stuff. But this video left me with the question of what do we do?
OFi73TzEN_8,"Knowing all that, why is there no revolution? Everyone needs to know these facts!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"People need to move en masse from the party line and find a dark horse, research all candidates not just the main two n maybe throw out weight behind a third option. The general populace also needs to realize that there is individual culpability too and personal accountability. Its frustrating cuz if people would find a balance between indiviuality and community we would be better off."
OFi73TzEN_8,"""I don't know why anyone runs for president to tell us what we can't do"". That's from Elizabeth Warren."
OFi73TzEN_8,"“Some people say we need a third party. I wish we had a second one.”
- Jim Hightower"
OFi73TzEN_8,Ew.. i hate this shit 'common sense' shit... conservatives here in Canada say it all the time!
OFi73TzEN_8,"So, what can we do?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Barack Obama 2007:
The first thing I’d do as president is sign the Freedom of Choice Act.

Barack Obama 2009: 
The Freedom of Choice Act is not highest legislative priority."
OFi73TzEN_8,"If you're not despondent, that's why Plato's cave smells like what you ate last night."
OFi73TzEN_8,"As we say in Brazil:
No fim, tudo acaba em pizza
(In the end it all ends in pizza)
{A.k.a. in the end nothing changes/gets done/moves forward}"
OFi73TzEN_8,5:40 those air quotes had to carry a lot of weight😅
OFi73TzEN_8,"Is this what being American is really about? Finding any way you can to get rich, no matter what?"
OFi73TzEN_8,This is why I'm voting either republican or RFK - worse than being my enemy is pretending to be my friend and betraying me.
OFi73TzEN_8,"It's the same with every western ""democracy"". The parties don't really oppose each other, they work together to keep the status quo intact by blocking the other parties policies (which they didn't want to implement anyway). This gives off the illusion of democracy while keeping the same system in place forever."
OFi73TzEN_8,Don’t feed the animals
OFi73TzEN_8,I am embarrassed to have Manchin as my senator...never voted for him.  I only vote green.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Nothing is funnier than hearing purportedly serious people claiming that ""democracy is under threat in America."" What the hell are they talking about, and when is democracy coming to the U.S.A.? We've been waiting since the 18th century!!!"
OFi73TzEN_8,Thanks!
OFi73TzEN_8,This is the ratchet effect
OFi73TzEN_8,"The GOP carouses their base by appealing to their sense of nostalgia -racism and bigotry- ; The Democratic Party cows their base by pretending to be their ally...except for these one or two rebels who always seem paid off by big donors. It's an abusive relationship, no matter who we pick."
OFi73TzEN_8,Because gun control. Social engineering after the Great Depression pushed all the gun folk away from socialist politicians because the wealthy were afraid of socialists with guns. This makes it very difficult for those people to get anything they actually want because they have Stockholm syndrome and most don't know how to break out of captivity. It also makes it hard for the Democrats to get a lot of support for policy but that's how they like it because they don't want to do most of that stuff they run on anyway.
OFi73TzEN_8,"I got one of those ""whAt ThE lEFt WoN't tELL yoU!!"" ads before this video so at least these ads are getting put behind videos like this lol"
OFi73TzEN_8,oh cool I have that shirt
OFi73TzEN_8,Wow there's a lot of stupid people in the comments defending the status quo.
OFi73TzEN_8,"✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊!
I got more info from this than CNN, ABC, CBS, MSNBC, NBC, and it goes on."
OFi73TzEN_8,"You mean we get bread AND circuses?!? 

Oh we have to buy our own bread.  And there is only the one bread seller.  And they only sell poison. And the circus has a monthly subscription."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Because they don’t want to. “If they wanted to, they would, “doesn’t just apply to dating."
OFi73TzEN_8,"The establishment is not divided. But they do sew division among the populace in order for us to buy into the left vs right bs. We typically agree on many issues, if framed in a way that makes sense to that person/group's thought process or local vocabulary. Don't buy into the ""too far gone"" narrative. Coming from a pansexual atheist in small town TX. I don't agree, but I know how to talk to them."
OFi73TzEN_8,"It's us and them. Them are a much smaller population than us. Take solace in this fact. We will prevail by thinking and doing. Humanity always triumphs, it's ingrained into our DNA. This channel is an example of this. Content like this could be eliminated by them, but the backlash from us would be worse for them. We have more power than we realize sometimes."
OFi73TzEN_8,The fact that the only options we have as a populace is intentional stagnation or a creeping Christian theocracy is exactly why we are overdue for a revolution
OFi73TzEN_8,"Their voters vote based on notoriety (""They have the best chance to beat the Republicans!""). This incentivizes politicians to ignore the people and serve the corporations (etc.) that secure the notoriety. Compromise kills democracy."
OFi73TzEN_8,"So, BASICALLY, politics is just learning how to string along their audience, in the different camps that exist following the model of professional wrestling? Whooda thunkit?"
OFi73TzEN_8,"It’s a very important time for this video, with the establishment shoving Kamala at us with no primary…"
OFi73TzEN_8,so sad
OFi73TzEN_8,"The fact that ""conservative Democrats"" exist is nuts.

But, explains *a lot.*"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Can you guys not found one or more new parties? European people recently voted for a lot of other parties than just the big ones. Sadly, mostl right wing. But thats another story. There is at least some movement here."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Sometimes I think about all the people who've ended themselves over stupid things like having medical debt. That's only one form of the many ways these people commit political violence against us, yet we are never even supposed to protest without permission."
OFi73TzEN_8,thats why Im just going to suck it up and pay those student loans off myself
OFi73TzEN_8,If you're an American and you think your vote matters at this point then you're beyond lost in the sauce.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Wow this video is all about bashing the Mr. Biden. How about he LITERALLY created MILLIONS of new jobs, boosted US economy to the roof and pulled the USA out of the inflation disaster after that sadistic orange weasel?

Unsubscribing + thumb down."
OFi73TzEN_8,Crazy how it always comes down to one person's double crossing vote in congress that decides the fate of the entire country's population. That is why people like Lieberman and Manchin are always there to ensure the power stay with the Republican party even if the Dems have the majority rule in congress. They ensure the right stays in power no matter what! Plus the Gridlock started with a Republican House Speaker named Newt Gingrich who was speaker of the house from 1995 - 1999. He FORBID all Republicans to stop voting with Democrats no matter what the issue was! This one man is mainly responsible for starting the endless gridlock in congress.
OFi73TzEN_8,Liberal politics are useless for the people.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats are a check valve. So long as power and money move towards the wealthy, they will not obstruct.  As soon as the will of the people is towards gaining power for themselves or gaining some rights, the democrats obstruct the flow, while holding back the pressure applied coming from the population."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Biden meeting Trump in jail:
Jailer: He builds walls in the borders, crushes unions and protests, supports genocides, and reduces taxes to the rich.
Biden: Wait, he does everything that I do.
Trump: but proudly!"
OFi73TzEN_8,The liberals in Canada are the same
OFi73TzEN_8,"The Democrats are a right wing party, just like the Republicans."
OFi73TzEN_8,democrats is overrated af
OFi73TzEN_8,"I say it all the time... If Manchin and Sinema didn't exist, the Democrats would just pull two more out of thin air to justify why they ""can't get things done."""
OFi73TzEN_8,It doesn't actually make any difference whether the President is Republican or Democrat. The genius of the American ruling class is that it has been able to make the people think that they have had something to do with the electing of presidents for 200 years when they've had absolutely nothing to say about the candidates or the policies or the way the country is run.-Gore Vidal
OFi73TzEN_8,Oooooo. Haven't watched yet but I always enjoy when a new second thought drops!
OFi73TzEN_8,thus democracy becometh corporatocracy.
OFi73TzEN_8,Is it weird I didn’t get early access through Patreon. I am totally cool and not changing my support because I have a lot of things I alway listen to but did anybody else have that issue
OFi73TzEN_8,"if it ain't money, it ain't!"
OFi73TzEN_8,"""Get in the coconut Shinji."""
OFi73TzEN_8,The Democrats are primarily distinguished as being only the *second-most* enthusiastic supporters of imperialist capitalism on the planet.
OFi73TzEN_8,"Why do anything and displease the big money when you can run on how you'll TOTALLY restore abortion rights this time; we promise! Also, if you don't vote for our candidate (which you had no part in selecting for yourselves), you're racist and sexist."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Democrats project the idea that they stand more with working-class people & on social issues like abortion, environment & civil rights (they usually do) but when it comes economics, war, or elections they're no different from Republicans, & fake Democrats like Joe Manchin & Kyrsten Sinema who put their own personal interests over the interests of the country. 🙅🏿‍♂️🤦🏽‍♀️"
OFi73TzEN_8,It's all MAGA and the tea party's fault!
OFi73TzEN_8,It's almost always voting between the lesser of 2 evils in this country; the Republicans only enact bad policies while Democrats never enact good policies.
OFi73TzEN_8,I don't understand why corporate lobbying just isn't banned completely.
OFi73TzEN_8,NEW VIDEO! FUCK YES!!!! DUDE I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL!!!! I as a first generation American from a family of Mexican immigrants I always felt lost in this American culture and the American dream I was raised to be very business savvy and yet everything I did felt like my community couldn't afford to support any of my business ideas or it felt like any idea to get my family into the middle class required doing gambling or scamming people online as being a fake Guru. So I've always questioned Society at Large Sensei young age. And since I was 14 and questioning Society I have always had chronic anxiety about my life and my future because my family was already struggling and barely getting by and it was up to me to change that and bring the American dream upon my family and I just felt like I was the problem in why my family is suffering. But since I started watching your channel I'm starting to understand how Society is rigged against the working class and especially against minority groups! Thank you!!!!!
OFi73TzEN_8,cus there pro capitalist at heart
OFi73TzEN_8,volvo video when
OFi73TzEN_8,Oh this should interesting
OFi73TzEN_8,There should be a warning label at election sites. Voting for either democrat or republican is hazardous to your health 😂
OFi73TzEN_8,"Isn't it obvious? They're all Republicans, just not in name. A LOT of them are even paid by the same people."
OFi73TzEN_8,It is not the job of the Democrats to enact popular will into law. Republicans as well. Shocker. Their job is to misdirect and distract the masses so that the empire can go uninterrupted with its agenda. Think the Ratchet Effect. Rotating villain strategy of the Democrats. This is how the masses forever get played.
OFi73TzEN_8,"we don't have a two party system, we have a ruling class and a clown show"
OFi73TzEN_8,Greatest fake team for the big club members' lies ever created.
OFi73TzEN_8,They don't need to show results. They just need to show potential.
OFi73TzEN_8,The fact that big tech outlets are not allowing an organic ranking of what should be recommended on people’s homepage is the reason we have the system we do since people vote for what they falsely think is good (corporate dems). So many people are trapped in right wing idw manosphere media bubbles. Or just afraid of buzz words like ‘socialism’
OFi73TzEN_8,Was literally watching a Second Thought video when I got this notification😭
OFi73TzEN_8,"Voting for either democrat or republican is like voting how you want to die, getting shot or stab. Both outcome will be hazardous to your health"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Howdy, friends! I hope you all enjoy the video. If you appreciate the work we do, please consider becoming a patron!

OFi73TzEN_8,"They get a lot of things done. Most of the time, it's putting money into their own pockets. Another favorite is telling people what they can and cannot say or do, all in the name of creating a more ""free"" environment."
OFi73TzEN_8,"This is going to Donald Trump re elected. 

Not saying you have to like Dems but making sure Trump stays out of office is top priority."
OFi73TzEN_8,cause it's another right wing party
OFi73TzEN_8,Minnesota and Wisconsin dems have presty good track record tho?
OFi73TzEN_8,"Nice timing, JT. 👏"
OFi73TzEN_8,"Please interview Aaron Mate, Ron Paul, Diane Sare and Glenn Greenwald"
OFi73TzEN_8,Filibuster
OFi73TzEN_8,"I just looked at the ballot for local government, congress, and senate. There were two only categories where more than one person was running. If you want to do more consider looking at yournstate house and court officers."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Listen, RFK Jr. gives me hope."
OFi73TzEN_8,Since the third way movement both parties are owned by corporate interests and the Democrats are the ones who are paid to lose while making it look like they are trying really hard.
OFi73TzEN_8,Vote blue anyway
OFi73TzEN_8,Is it me or has second thought another vibe than years before?
OFi73TzEN_8,Why change anything when it's the status quo that made you president?
OFi73TzEN_8,
OFi73TzEN_8,dawg what
OFi73TzEN_8,A dose of reality to counteract my Kamala high.
OFi73TzEN_8,Nearly midnight in Australia and a Second Thought video drops.  RIP sleep i guess.
OFi73TzEN_8,Christmas has come early
OFi73TzEN_8,Been a sub for a looooong time.. Awesome seeing different coverage from you man 🔥
OFi73TzEN_8,"In the end it doesn't matter, money is always pulling the strings. And it's crazy some people think vote of a oligarch is equivalent to his..."
OFi73TzEN_8,"Voting for democrats will save capitalism
That's the statement 
PERIOD"
OFi73TzEN_8,6th
OFi73TzEN_8,Dang 42 seconds I’ll take

This is a friendly reminder that:

1. Kamala Harris **will** be the first to reach 270 and become the 47th President of the United States of America.

2. Donald Trump **will** demand that the vote count be stopped in any state, especially Pennsylvania, as long as he is in the lead. He did it in 2020 and he will definitely do it again.

3. Donald Trump **will** declare himself the winner even before all votes are counted. He did it in 2020 and he'll definitely do it again.

4. Donald Trump **will** blame everyone else because he lost the 2024 election instead of blaming himself.

5. Militias **are currently** threatening violence against election officials if they certify Kamala Harris as the winner of this election.

08NGLIV0JLM,Minnesota GOP sued the cheating dems and won in MN and now have equal amount of people watching the polls and counting.
08NGLIV0JLM,"So weird to hear the former speaker say without even a moment of self-awareness that, ""in North Carolina 1, so far black turnout is still just around 35%.  If the black vote remains low, then we probably win it.""  

I mean, yeah, Kevin.  That's also broadly and historically true, isn't it?  If the black vote is low, then republicans benefit.  Gee, I hope that never becomes an unvirtuous impulse for your party to create structural voter suppression that targets black voters.  

Like gerrymandering.  Or reducing the number of places to vote to a minimum in districts where black voters live.  Or passing laws that criminalize even giving bottles of water to voters who for the aforementioned reasons have to spend an hour or more in line to cast their vote. Or using anonymized robocalls deployed in micro-markets specifically to black voters that suggest if they show up to vote, a criminal task force maybe be waiting at the voter location to arrest anyone with a warrant or unpaid child support.  Or passing voter ID requirements that are nakedly phrased to exclude black voters (example:  codifying what is considered to be legit voter ID by accepting a hunting license but rejecting a picture ID issued by government to recipients of welfare programs).

My bad, Kevin--that's all stuff that has already happened as recently as this year and as long ago as 2004. But the core lesson remains true, right? ""If the black vote remains low, then we probably win it."""
08NGLIV0JLM,Also I find it interesting that they said he needs to win Pennsylvania when ABC already “mistakenly” said Kamala won *cough cheated*
08NGLIV0JLM,"How any new yorker can vote for Kamala is bonkers.  That's city is already in the toilet. If Kamala wins, NYC is getting flushed down the toilet."
08NGLIV0JLM,All of my family in Pennsylvania are Puerto Rican and they’re voting for Trump.
08NGLIV0JLM,"We don’t care about polls We care about votes, cast and votes counted and no cheating."
08NGLIV0JLM,The comment section is where it’s at. 💯 Trump!

08NGLIV0JLM,Where did 1.7 Million Biden Votes go? 2024 They never were real votes.
08NGLIV0JLM,"Kevin McCarthy is confusing registered Republican early turnout for trump votes. That is not how it works. Republicans elected trump in 2016. 
Republicans elected Biden in 2020. 
Republicans will decide this election and it’s Gonna be a Harris win, a democrat led Senate and we will need to see about the house"
08NGLIV0JLM,Will we know who wins tonight or tomorrow
08NGLIV0JLM,"So you’re saying one states determines the other 49? BTW, there is no way this many people will vote for Haris, absolutely not, people know she is a horrendous disaster hot mess of a person. The cheat is absolutely the only way possible for her to take even 10 states. This is exactly what’s wrong with our Country Democrats. We must have 100% election integrity."
08NGLIV0JLM,👍
08NGLIV0JLM,I wish Pennsylvania (and other states that wait) would start counting early and mail in ballots before Election Day.
08NGLIV0JLM,"If GOD exists, Trump will Win."

08NGLIV0JLM,Youtube is already admitting they are compliant in cheating.
08NGLIV0JLM,"I suspect the Pennsylvania results will be delayed by those write-in votes that are impossible to trace, are always counted last, and always -- AMAZINGLY -- always occur in just the right number and purely Democrat persuasion to provide the Dem candidate with a ""victory."""

08NGLIV0JLM,Trump is my president and its clean house time
08NGLIV0JLM,Will the polls really close at 7 ? Stay up over night to watch that because I seen the numbers change over night when trump won that  last election and yet biden was declared winner due to a suspicious change around 3 am . Dont be fooled and keep your eyes peeled or else you will be blinded by the bs .
08NGLIV0JLM,The race is all but over. Harris ground game wayyyy better in PA.

08NGLIV0JLM,McCarthy quit when he rightly lost the speakership.  He’s a sore loser and his seat will likely turn blue.
08NGLIV0JLM,Kamala just voted for Trump
08NGLIV0JLM,When Trump wins he should make sure that the evidence of the 2020 steal is showed to the American people in full detail & who was behind it all ! Then put them all in jail !! And then tell the rest of the crazies that an apology would be nice lol lol 😝
08NGLIV0JLM,One state should not decide our president.
